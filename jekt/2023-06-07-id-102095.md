## Abstract:
"The purpose of this research is to find out the factors that influence the decision of women workers after the Covid-19 pandemic to migrate abroad to increase household/family income and find out other causes outside of the research variables that make the decisions of women workers. The object of this research is female workers who have been migrant workers or who have never been migrant workers in East Lombok Regency, West Nusa Tenggara Province. This study uses primary data, namely questionnaires and in-depth interviews as well as secondary data obtained from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) of West Nusa Tenggara Province. The research method used is a quantitative approach with Binary Logistics analysis tools. The results of the analysis show that age, number of children, and former TKW affect a person's chances of deciding to become a TKW to migrate abroad, but the level of education does not affect the decision to migrate."
