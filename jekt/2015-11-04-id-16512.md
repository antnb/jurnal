This study focus on the impact of internal factors (NIM, BOPO, CAR, LDR and NPL) and external factors (inflation, BIrate, IHSG and GDPdeflator) before and after crisis.

Finally, is to give recommendation for managerial banking policy. This study using random effect method. The empirical result shows that Indonesia go-public banking is influenced by several factor both internal and external factors. After crisis CAR has positive and significant effect on ROA by 0,1 times larger than the effect of before crisis CAR. Whereas other internal factor (BOPO, NPL and NIM) give the same effect on ROA, both before and after crisis. Bank ownership (DUMP) and LDR have no significant effect on ROA neither before nor after crisis. External factor (Infation, BIrate and IHSG) are significant different effect on ROA’s before and after crisis condition.
