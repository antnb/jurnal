Based on BPS data in 2010, Bali has 174.900 people who life in poor condition, which is 4,88 percent of all residence. High economic growth (GDRP growth) that have achieved cannot significantly reduce number of poor people. This study analyzed the impact of education program, number of population, GDRP, share of agricultural sector, and share of industry sector toward poverty in Bali.

Number of population, GDRP, and share of agricultural sector has positive and significant effect toward poverty; meanwhile share of industry sector has negative and significant effect toward poverty."
