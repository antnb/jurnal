## Abstract:
"Social graph describes the graphical model of users and how they are related to each other online. Social network consists of a set of nodes (sometimes referred to as actors or vertices in graph theory) connected via some type of relations which are known as edges. Actors are the smallest unit of the network. It can be Persons, Organizations, and Families etc. Relations can be of many types such as directed, undirected, and weighted. Social network analysis consists of two phases. One is data collection phase and another is analysis phase. Data is collected with the help of surveys, Social sites such as face book, LinkedIn. We first input the user information in form of two dimensional matrices. Then we construct a graph based on the relationships among users from adjacency matrix. We can draw a directed graph or a simple graph based on the user input information from adjacency matrix. After analyzing the graph properties based on degree of node, centrality and other parameters we will give effective solution. There are many applications of analyzing social network for example examine a network of farm animals, to analyze how disease spread from one cow to another, discover emergent communities of interest among faculty at various universities, Some public sector uses include development of leader engagement strategies, analysis of individual and group engagement and media use, and community-based problem solving etc. Social network analysis is used widely in the social and behavioral sciences, as well as in economics, marketing, and industrial engineering. The social network perspective focuses on the relationships among social entities and is an important addition to standard social and behavioral research which is primarily concerned with attributes of the social units."
