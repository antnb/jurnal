Based on the research results, the recommendation in the first rank is Payang with a selectivity criterion value of 1, followed by drift and Dogol which have the same value, namely a high selectivity criterion of 0.5. The conclusion of this study is that the Payang, drift, and Dogol fishing gear are classified as environmentally friendly traditional fishing gear using the SMART (Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique) method because they can produce catches with high selectivity, minimal habitat damage, high-quality fish production, not harmful to humans. fisherman. themselves and other people around and produce fish that do not harm consumers."
