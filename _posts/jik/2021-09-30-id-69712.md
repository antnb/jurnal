## Abstract:
"Through image compression, can save bandwidth usage on telecommunication networks, accelerate image file sending time and can save memory in image file storage. Technique to reduce image size through compression techniques is needed. Image compression is one of the image processing techniques performed on digital images with the aim of reducing the redundancy of the data contained in the image so that it can be stored or transmitted efficiently. This research analyzed the results of image compression and measure the error level of the image compression results. The analysis to be carried out is in the form of an analysis of JPEG compression techniques with various types of images. The method of measuring the compression results uses the MSE and PSNR methods. Meanwhile, to determine the percentage level of compression using the compression ratio calculation. The average ratio for JPEG compression was 0.08605, the compression rate was 91.39%. The average compression ratio for the DWT method was 0.133090833, the compression rate was 86.69%. The average compression ratio of the SVD method was 0.101938833 and the compression rate was 89.80%."
