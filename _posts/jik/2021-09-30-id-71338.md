## Abstract:
"This research was carried out to simplify or assist Candra Motor workshop owners in managing data and archives of motorcycle parts sales by applying a data mining a priori algorithm method. Data mining is an operation that uses a particular technique or method to look for different patterns or shapes in a selected data. Sales data for a year with the number of 15 items selected using the priori algorithm method. A priori algorithm is an algorithm for taking data with associative rules (association rule) to determine the associative relationship of an item combination. In a priori algorithm, it is determined frequent itemset-1, frequent itemset-2, and frequent itemset-3 so that the association rules can be obtained from previously selected data. To obtain the frequent itemset, each selected data must meet the minimum support and minimum confidence requirements. In this study using minimum support ? 7 or 0.583 and minimum confidence of 90%. So that some rules of association were obtained, where the calculation of the search for association rules manually and using WEKA software obtained the same results.By fulfilling the minimum support and minimum confidence requirements, the most sold spare parts are inner tube, Yamaha oil and MPX oil."
