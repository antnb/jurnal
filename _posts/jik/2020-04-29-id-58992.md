## Abstract:
"Spoofing attack is an attempt to acquire some other’s identity or access right by using a biometric evidence of authorized user. Among all biometric systems facial identity is one of the widely used method that is prone to such spoofing attacks using a simple photograph of the user. The paper focuses and takes the problem area of face spoofing attacks into account by detecting spoof faces and real faces. We are using the local binary pattern (LBP) for providing the solution of spoofing problem and with the help of these patterns we inspect primarily two types of attacks i.e. printed photograph and photos displayed using digital screen. For this, we will use the local database maintained by us having the images labeled as real and spoof for the data required. We conclude that local binary pattern will reduce the total error rate and will show the moderate output when used across a wide set of attack types. This will enhance the efficiency of the system for detection of spoofing by using the deep learning techniques"
