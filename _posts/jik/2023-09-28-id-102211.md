## Abstract:
"The utilization of facial recognition technology has become increasingly imperative within the realm of online learning. The current study introduces a novel system that utilizes face recognition technology to record attendance in online learning environments. The attendance system necessitates students to activate an attendance button, whereby their attendance is subsequently documented through facial recognition technology. The system recognizes students as present solely based on facial recognition. The system stores the duration of online learning activities in a database. Implementing machine learning methodologies, specifically face detection algorithms, improves precision and efficacy in administering student attendance in online education. The system utilizes Haar cascades in OpenCV to detect faces, extract features such as eyes, nose, and mouth, and classify them using LBPH. Through extensive experiments, an accuracy rate of 93.55% was achieved. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the combined approach, showcasing the potential of Haar cascades and LBPH in face recognition tasks. The present study makes a valuable contribution to the domains of computer vision and educational technology by offering a pragmatic remedy for attendance tracking in virtual learning settings."
