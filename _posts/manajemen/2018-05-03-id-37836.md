Data collection method used is purposive sampling. Data collection was done by distributing questionnaires. Furthermore, data from the results of collecting questionnaires processed by using the validity test, and reliability test to determine the feasibility and consistency of indicators in the questionnaire. In addition, another test is conducted path analysis (path analysis) and Solimun Theory.
