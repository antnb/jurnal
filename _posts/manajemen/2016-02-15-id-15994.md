"Price Earning Ratio is a ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its earnings per-share.

The sample in this study is a company incorporated in the Indeks Kompas 100 during the period of 2011-2014. The method used is multiple linear regression. This study proves that the return on assets , earnings growth and earnings variability is partially significant effect on the price earning ratio affects the Compass 100 Index , while the dividend payout ratio does not significantly influence the price earnings ratio on the Indeks Kompas 100.
