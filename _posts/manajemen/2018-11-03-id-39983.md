The results of this study show that partially positive Spread has no significant effect on Return On Assets (ROA) on BPR in Denpasar City 2014-2016. Non Performing Loan (NPL) has a significant negative effect on ROA in BPR in Denpasar City 2014-2016. Operational Costs to Operating Income (BOPO) have a significant negative effect on ROA in BPR in Denpasar City 2014-2016. The implications of this study the higher Spread ratio will increase the ROA of banking companies. While the NPL and BOPO the higher the ratio of these variables, then the ROA of banking companies will decrease, so to improve the ROA of banking companies have to press NPL and utilize existing sources and systems.
