Service quality variables, with the dimensions of physical evidence (tangibles), and assurance, each have a positive and significant effect on customer satisfaction, then the reliability, responsiveness and empathy variables each show no significant influence on customer satisfaction. This research found that the guarantee variable has the greatest influence on customer satisfaction. Keywords: physical evidence (tangibles), reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy, customer satisfaction."
