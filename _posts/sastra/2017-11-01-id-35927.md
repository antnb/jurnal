## Abstract:
"Metaphor is known as one of interesting phenomenons in linguistic study in which the translator often encounter problems on it’s translation due to language and culture differences. In order to understanding the meaning of metaphor, Larson divided metaphor’s structure into topic, image, and point of similarity. To analyze the translation of methapor that the translator used, according to Newmark, there are seven types of procedures that appliable. They are reproducing the same image in the target language (TL), replacing the image in the source language (SL) with a standard TL image, translation of metaphor by simile, translation of metaphor by simile plus sense, converting metaphor to sense, deletion, and combining same metaphor with sense."
