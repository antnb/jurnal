## Abstract:
"In the process of changes in socio-cultural Bali, the presence of modernity is aninevitable thing. Some claim to modernity as a reference, objectives and even the road toprogress, both in the technical and practical ideas. There are also points out, theemergence of modernity often offend traditional values of this island, which standardizedthrough a series of conservation efforts.It also emerged in the works of Balinese art, which has been in contact withmodernity since the entry of outside painting techniques of artists such as Rudolf Bonnet, Walter Spies, Arie Smith, and so on. With reference to the process of creation andcreativity of two artists of Bali, Ketut Budiana and Made Wianta, this paper aims toclarify the idea of these Balinese artists in the face of the process of changing the cultureof Bali.Although both artists are trying to explore different visual art, the characteristics of tradition has remained present in their creativity. The trend of the creation of two artists, despite the attempt to achieve a universal modernity, but the views, thoughts and style of Balinese painting with full canvas, figurative iconic Bali, as well as the form of typical traditional way is also seen. It is suspected due to the influence of childhood each one very closely with the Balinese cultural memory, and prove that even though modernity tried to change many things in the present life, the basic characteristics of the tradition will not disappear, which actually can be developed into a form of awareness of the importance of maintaining the value locality for the preservation of cultural heritage of Bali."
