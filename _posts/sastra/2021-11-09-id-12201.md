## Abstract:
"Psychological conflict is psychological situation when someone experienced two or moremotives that contradicted one with another. Psychological conflict can be found insituation where need, hope, wish, and aim are different and contradicted each other atthe same time and caused unpleasant feeling. Psychological conflict can also be found inmanga, one of them is in Subaru. The psychological conflict in this manga were analyzedbased on theory of psychoanalytic and supported with theory of semiotic and theory ofdrawing a comic. The result shows that there are five forms of psychological conflictsthat Subaru have experience such as feeling guilty over the death of Kazuma, confusion ofchoosing between ballet or education, Subaru vacillation when perfoming on stage forthe first time, feeling guilty over the death of Izusu aunt, and Subaru vacillation betweenback to Japan or leave Japan. The efforts of Subaru to overcome his psychologicalconflicts are making Kazuma death as a motivation to continue ballet, decided to live asballerina, convincing herself to be brave to dance on stage, motivated herself to winLausanne contest after the Izusu death, and decided to leave Japan."
