The method used to collect data in this research is observation method. In the data analysis the method used is the pragmatic approach method. On the presentation stage of data analysis, it uses the informal methods.The analysis results showed that in Densha Otoko novel, there were 14 types of expressive speech. 1) thanking, 2) praising, 3) criticizing, 4) blaming, 5) expressing sympathy, 6) congratulating, 7) complain, 8) pardoning, 9) rating, 10) expressing embarassement, 11) Expressing shock feeling, 12) kidding, 13) greeting, and 14) farewell. Perlocutionary act of expressive speech contained in the novel Densha Otoko is not only generated by speakers to influence the hearers, however the speakers sometimes only express expressive speech with declarative sentence mode.
