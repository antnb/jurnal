Inthe psychological analysis theory of personality structure proposed by Sigmund Freudwhich are id, ego, and superego is used and the defense mechanism. Those threecomponents are affected behavior, pattern of thinking and psychology of the maincharacters. From the analysis it can be found that the main characters have the strong id.They tend to avoid the uncomfortable feeling ignoring the reality that they actually cannot do that.
