An existence of women should not be under estimated, Women have amysterious power, despite not being used to their full capacity, due to their desireof marriage over lifetime employment. On literature work, a few of the Japanesecarrier woman displayed in it. One of them is Moyoco Anno’s work, mangaHataraki Man. Hiroko Matsukata is a woman who works for a magazine company.She puts all she has into her work, and is known as a strong, straightforwardworking girl, who can at will turn herself into Hataraki man (working man) mode.Despite Hiroko's success at work, her life lacks romance."
