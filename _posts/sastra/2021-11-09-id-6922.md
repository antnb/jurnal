## Abstract:
"Mythology concepts are often included into literature work, like novels, comics,etc. Naruto comic is one of the Japanese literature work which is inspired by Japanesemythology. By using the theory of literary anthropology, the Naruto comic is analyzed from the point of view of ethnography to see the cultural aspects of Japanese society. According to the result of the analysis, we can say that Naruto comic is adapting ShintoGods and Goddess and also youkai from the Japanese mythology. It’s using the name ofShinto Gods as the name of ninja techniques. Those gods are Izanagi no Mikoto, Izanamino Mikoto, Amaterasu Oomikami, Tsukuyomi no Mikoto, and Susanoo no Mikoto. Narutocomic is also told about a supernatural powerful creature called the bijuu. There arethree bijuu among nine bijuu which have similarities with the youkai in Japanesemythology. Those youkai are tanuki, nekomata, and kitsune. Although shown in adifferent form, but the depiction is not separated from the myth."
