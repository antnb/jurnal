Clasification of the 186 stone tools found in Gede Cave Site excavation in Box III, while analysis to trace wear of 27 stone tools that represent each type, subtype, and size. The analysis result shows that, the stone tools from Box III of Gede Cave Site can be classified into five types, namely: MLD, MTJ, MST, BLD, and BTJ. MLD type was used to scrape wood and leather, to whittle bone; to saw, and to perforate the leather. MTJ type was used to scrape wood, and leather; to plane wood; and to whittle bone. MST type was used to scrape the wood, leather,and plants. BLD and BTJ types were used to choppe wood. MLD.Cb, BTJ.Lr, MLD.Lr, and MTJ.Lr type cannot be predicted what its function."
