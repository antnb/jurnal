The main focuses of analysis are: first is the structure of the novel especially related to the intrinsic structure and the relation between structure to build a coherent story. Secondly, this research focuses on the sociological aspect of the novel which can be categorized into social, moral, cultural and economical aspects. This research adopts structural and sociological theories of literacy. Structural theory is used to analyze the intrinsic structure of the novel and the relation between those structures while sociological theory is used to explain the sociological aspect of the novel. This research relies on Umar Junus’s (1986) sociological theory of literacy which argues that literacy is part of a social and cultural document.
