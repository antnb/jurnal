## Abstract:
"The purpose of this writing is to find out or to know the factors that cause soundchanges of the Sanskrit loan vocabulary in Balinese language. There are two theoriesapplied, respectively the theory of Sound Change proposed by Terry Crowley (1987) andtheory of Generative Transformation. Two methods chosen for collecting data aremethods of observation and descriptive-contrastive. For the data analysis was appliedmethod of translational equity with basic technique of determine separated element and thecontinued technique of comparison and relation. The presentation of data were both informal and informal methods. Sanskrit data was in the written form while the data inBalinese language was taken from the spoken one. The process of phoneme change wascaused by two factors namely intralingual factors and ekstralingual. Intralingual factor is afactor in the language environment, while ekstralingual factors are factors outside thelanguage."
