There were two problems formulated, namely: the form and contents of the 15 poems of poetry anthology Manusia Istana by Radhar Panca Dahana. The purpose of this study was to determine the form and contents of the 15 poems of poetry anthology Manusia Istana. This study carried out literature and descriptive analytic method. The technique used was collecting, recording, interpreting and sampling techniques. The analysis was done by conducting several steps. First, analyzing the creative process of Radhar Panca Dahana’s work. Second, analyzing of the form and content of the poetry anthology Manusia Istana. Aspect of form consists of diction, sound, imagery and figurative language. Aspect of content consists of themes and messages.
