The theory used in this study are phonological theory andthe theory of sosiolingistik.The method used in this study through three stages, namely the stage of thesupply of data, data analysis, and presentation of analysis results. Spelling Balinese scriptis now inherited by the people of Bali have undergone several dynamics. Spelling is usedto first prototype dresta spelling or pairs, then in 1931 set spelling Schwartz, and theresults of the Great Mother Bali The Assembly decided in 1957 to continue usingprototype pairs dresta with some changes. Despite efforts to improve spelling Balinesescript is done on a continuous basis but is still found in competing forms domains usingBalinese script. The factors that cause these competing forms can be classified into two:internal and external factors. Internal factors caused by the level of knowledge of thescience of linguistics, especially phonology and etymology of the word is not optimal.While external factors due to the onslaught of the Latin alphabet, Balinese scriptregeneration stagnation in the realm of the family, and a portrait of the Balinese languagelearning in there almof education is not optimal."
