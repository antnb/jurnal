It is said that global issue can be seen by regulating international law such Wiena Declaration, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms Discrimination Against Woman (1979) Declaration of Violence Against Woman (1993), and Bejing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995). Nationally, the law regulation about issue can be seen in as Criminal Law, Private Law, Act Number 1, 1974, Act Number 7, 1984, Act Number 39, 1999, and Act Number 23, 2004.
