PT Dyandra Promosindo as one of the largest MICE business actors in Indonesia plays an important role in the advancement of the MICE industry and also works together with the government in the growth of tourism in Indonesia. In this article, the researcher uses the associative research method which is obtained in the form of sentences and observations. This research focuses on the mutual relationship between the two parties studied, namely PT Dyandra Promosindo and the government, as well as the impact of this collaboration on the wider community.
