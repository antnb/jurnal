## Abstract:
"This study reconstructs the reality behind women's empowerment by PT Yakult IndonesiaPersada Kandis District Region. This empowerment is done by employing housewives as YakultLady. The Yakult Lady system is to sell Yakult products while promoting a healthy lifestyle.Based on field observations, researchers found a different reality from Yakult Lady's work.There are subtle exploits that are not visible in Yakult's communication with the Yakult Lady.Yakult utilizes the psychology of current workers who do not need to be rewarded with moneybut with appreciation or flattery through euphemisms for the words they communicate. This formof distribution of exploitation is a new capitalism in Indonesia. Through the critical theory of MaxHorkheimer and the theory of social construction of the target group, Anne Schneider andHellen Ingram obtained research results that the Yakult Lady is empowered and exploited at thesame time."
