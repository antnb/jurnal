This study uses a qualitativei descriptiveo approachi. Thep resultsi of thei studyp indicate that Golkar's success in defending itself from the shocks of party internal conflicts stemmed from the Party's strength. According to the theory used the results of the study showi thati first, thei adaptation scheme, used by Golkar as a form of the main force in maintaining existential and determining the direction of the Golkar party in the new political era.

Butu on thei otherp handi, the strong leadership in the Golkar party plays a very important role as a driver of cadre consolidation in maintaining the existence of the party in the community. Third, Golkar in maintaining party resistance also prioritizes the consistency of cadres in framing a good party platform as its Integrity.
