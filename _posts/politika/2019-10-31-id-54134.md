The presence of community group the local electoral in Bali in particular is able to provide its own color.

With the Patron-Client Theory approach, this research presents as a description of how the actions carried out by CSOs with a background of violence in fighting over the land of power, and of course the status of power. Dynamic politics makes this phenomenon polarized in diverse manifestations. There is a cultural connection, but there also involves a broker in it. Research using ethnographic qualitative methods or field research. The results of this study explain that the clientelism relationship that occurs is a remuneration for assistance given by Patron to Clients.
