The agreement of grained-rice price on December 2001 (s=1%) is Rp 1540,00/kg ; (s=5%) is Rp 1490,00/kg and on (s=10%) is Rp 1420,00/kg. on January 2002 (s=1%) is Rp 1610,00/kg ; (s=5%) is Rp 1550,00/kg and on (s=10%) is Rp 1480,00/kg; on March 2002 (s=1%) is Rp 1900,00/kg; (s=5%) is Rp 1850,00/kg and on (s=10%) is Rp 1770,00/kg."
