Depression status was measured by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Among 45 samples, 71.11% is developing depression. The prevalence of depression is found higher among female workers with long-time working: (1) depression with long duration of work is about 87.5% and (2) depression with long job tenure is about 86.4%. This study also found the significant difference in prevalence of depression with duration of work (p = 0.01) and job tenure (p = 0.027). The conclusion is the long-time working could increase the prevalence ratio of depression among female workers. In other words, there is significant difference in proportion of depression among female workers with long-time working and short-time working at Bisma Group Company Denpasar.
