Using Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) methods besides TB bacteria, there were also other organisms identified such as fungal, mostly Aspergillus and Candida. Bali was the province with high cases of TB. But until now there were no data for the prevalence of fungal from TB patient sputum. The research method was a cross sectional using secondary data patient examination report in RSUP Sanglah, Denpasar, Bali since 2011 to 2013. Result will be presented by descriptive analysis. 1318 (13%) fungal sample was positive from total 10.068 sample on January 2011- June 2013.
