Of the total 40 samples, a total of 35 respondents (87.5%) had a good family support, and as many as five respondents (12.5%) of respondents had poor family support. A total of 21 respondents (52.5%) experienced depression and as many as 19 respondents (47.5%) did not have depression. From the results of the bivariate analysis p value = 0.65 which indicates that there was no significant relationship between family support with depression in the elderly in Elderly Social Institution Wana Seraya Denpasar Bali, but the OR value obtained was 1.7, which suggests that depression happens to the respondent with the support of poor families increased 1.7 times compared with good family support.
