## Abstract:
"Consumptionof fresh and processed tomato products is associated with reducedrisk of prostate cancer. The emerging hypothesis is that lycopene,the primary red carotenoid in tomatoes, may be the principlephytochemical responsible for this reduction in risk. A numberof potential mechanisms by which lycopene may act have emerged,including serving as an important in vivo antioxidant, enhancingcell-to-cell communication via increasing gap junctions betweencells, and modulating cell-cycle progression. Although the effectof lycopene is biologically relevant, the tomato is also anexcellent source of nutrients, including folate, vitamin C,and various other carotenoids and phytochemicals, such as polyphenols,which also may be associated with lower cancer risk. Tomatoesalso contain significant quantities of potassium, as well assome vitamin A and vitamin E."
