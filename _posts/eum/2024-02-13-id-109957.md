The research design is a descriptive study of 70 cases of NPC at Central General Hospital Prof. Dr. I.G.N.G Ngoerah Denpasar from 2021 to 2022. Samples were collected retrospectively from secondary data using a total sampling technique through a cross-sectional study, samples were obtained from medical record data and hospital management system of Central General Hospital Prof. Dr. I.G.N.G Ngoerah Denpasar.
