This research variable consists of independent variable intensity of smartphone usage, dependent variable de Quervain syndrome of both hands, and control variable age, gender, and medical study program. Somers’ D bivariate test results showed no relationship (p&gt; 0.05) between intensity of smartphone usage and risk of de Quervain appearance on both hands. This condition was influenced by position when using a smartphone, type of smartphone, and other factors. Further research is needed related to other factors that influence the risk of de Quervain syndrome appearance and other musculoskeletal disorders.
