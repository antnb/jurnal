The majority of patients with acute heart failure due to coronary heart disease come to the Emergency Room with complaints of shortness of breath. Initial treatment given in the Emergency Room included intravenous diuretic Furosemide with a dose range of 20-80 mg/IV (93.02%), Beta blockers (2.35%), Nitroglycerin (13.95%), Digoxin (13.95%), and Dobutamine (30.23%). Most of the patients in this study were given Furosemide as an initial treatment according to the PERKI 2020 guidelines which suggest the administration of Furosemide as a treatment for fluid congestion in acute heart failure. Some patients require inotropic support such as Dobutamine which is adjusted according to individual clinical criteria.
