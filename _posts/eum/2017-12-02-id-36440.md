The aim of this study was describe the relationship of BMI, and physical activity with the handgrip muscle strength in T2DM patients in Sanglah Hospital, Denpasar. A cross sectional analytic study conducted in Diabetes Centre Sanglah Hospital, between March and September 2016. Sixty one samples aged between 43-78 years old were collected using consecutive sampling. 36 samples (59.0%) had low handgrip muscle strength, 25 samples (41.0%) had moderate handgrip muscle strength, and no sample have strong handgrip muscle strength. Mean of muscle strength was 21.26 kgs (range between 13.00 kgs-33.0 kgs).There was no correlation found between BMI and handgrip muscle strength (r = -0.236, p = 0.067). There was a significant weak positive correlation between physical activity and handgrip muscle strength (r = 0.340, p = 0.007).
