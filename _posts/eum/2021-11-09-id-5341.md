Dialysis consists of two major categories such as dialysis / hemodialysis intermittent and continuous dialysis / continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). SLEDD is the latest technique of renal replacement therapy that uses conventional hemodialysis equipment, but the therapeutic results like continuous dialysis therapy / CRRT were appropriate used in patien with critical ill."
