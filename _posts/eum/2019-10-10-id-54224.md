## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Penyakit infeksi merupakan masalah kesehatan terbesar di seluruh dunia yang disebabkan oleh mikroorganisme patogen, salah satunya adalah Staphylococcus aureus. Seiring maraknya penggunaan antibiotik yang tidak rasional, S. aureus menjadi salah satu bakteri yang paling resisten terhadap antibiotik, dan angka kejadiannya terus meningkat dengan munculnya strain yang resisten. Biji pepaya merupakan salah satu bahan alami yang mengandung senyawa kimia seperti alkaloid dan terpenoid yang memiliki potensi antibakteri yang mungkin dapat menghambat pertumbuhan S. aureus. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui potensi ekstrak biji pepaya (Carica papaya L.) dalam memengaruhi pertumbuhan bakteri S. aureus ATCC 25923 dengan menggunakan metode true experimental post test only group design. Sampel terdiri dari enam kelompok perlakuan, yaitu empat kelompok ekstrak biji pepaya (konsentrasi 25%, 50%, 75%, dan 100%), kontrol positif berupa antibiotik vankomisin 30 ?g, dan kontrol negatif etanol 96%. Zona hambat terbesar diperoleh pada konsentrasi ekstrak 100% dengan rerata 17 mm tergolong berdaya hambat sedang sesuai kategori Greenwood. Data hasil penelitian dianalisis dengan uji non parametrik Kruskal Wallis didapatkan nilai p = 0,000 dan analisis Post Hoc menggunakan uji Mann Whitney didapatkan nilai signifikansi seluruhnya kurang dari 0,05. Dapat disimpulkan bahwa ekstrak biji pepaya dapat menghambat pertumbuhan bakteri Staphylococcus aureus dengan perbedaan daya hambat yang bermakna dalam konsentrasi 50%, 75%, dan 100%. Kata kunci : ekstrak biji pepaya, Staphylococcus aureus, aktivitas antibakteri ABSTRACT Infectious disease is still being the major health problem worldwide. It is caused by microorganism (pathogenes), which is Staphylococcus aureus as one of them. As the use of antibiotics becoming irrational, it causes S. aureus to become the most resistance bacteria to antibiotics and the insidence is increasing as the MRSA is known. The papaya seed as one of nature’s product contains phytochemicals, such as alkaloid and terpenoid which has a potency as natural antibacteria that might supress the growth of S. aureus. This study aims to understand the potency of papaya (Carica papaya L.) seed extract toward the growth of S. aureus ATCC 25923 using true experimental post test only control group design. The sample was divided into six group which contained four concentrations of papaya seed extract (25%, 50%, 75%, dan 100%), positive control was vancomycin 30 ?g, and the negative control was etanol 96%. The result of the inhibitory zone was counted using caliper. The largest inhibitory zone was found at 100% concentration by 17 mm average, classified as moderate inhibition based on Greenwood category. Those results were statistically analyzed using non parametric test Kruskal Wallis (p=0,000) with Post Hoc test by Mann Whitney. The significancy value (p) were all below 0,05. It can be concluded that papaya seed extract could inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and each concentration (50%, 75%, 100%) had a significant difference. Keywords: papaya seed extract, Staphylococcus aureus, antibacterial activity"
