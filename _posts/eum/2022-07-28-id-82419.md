This study is analytic with a cross sectional approach. The technique is total sampling adjusted to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data obtained were gender, age, anatomical location of head and neck cancer, stage of cancer, therapy, KPS, and EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35. Data was collected for 3 months and 45 samples were obtained. There were 24 patients ((53.3%) above 45 years old. 33 men (73.3%) and 12 women (26.7%). The most cases were nasopharyngeal cancer is 25 people (55.6%). A total of 19 patients (42.2%) were in stage IV. The most used therapies were surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy is 19 people (41.3%). The mean KPS is 72.23 ± 16.992. The factor affect the quality of life of head and neck cancer patients the most is weight loss with a mean of 59.49 ± 49.989 and a significant correlation (p=0.000, p&lt;0.05) between EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 and KPS."
