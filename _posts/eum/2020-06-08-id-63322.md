## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Jumlah perokok di Indonesia terdata meningkat dari tahun ke tahun. Fenomena merokok ini tidak jarang dijumpai di kalangan usia muda. Tren usia mulai merokok tertinggi di Indonesia berada pada rentang usia 15-19 tahun yang tergolong usia masuk Perguruan Tinggi. Pemerintah Indonesia berupaya menekan jumlah perokok dengan mengeluarkan peraturan mengenai pencantuman pictorial health warning (PHW) pada bungkus rokok. Penelitian ini bertujuan mengetahui gambaran pengetahuan, sikap, dan persepsi mahasiswa Universitas Udayana terhadap PHW pada bungkus rokok. Penelitian deskriptif cross-sectional ini dilakukan di 13 Fakultas Universitas Udayana, melibatkan seluruh mahasiswa aktif di tahun ajaran 2018/2019, dengan pengambilan sampel dilakukan secara accidental. Karakteristik sampel, pengetahuan, sikap, dan persepsi mahasiswa terhadap PHW diperoleh dengan kuesioner. Data dianalisis dengan statistical package software untuk Windows secara univariat. Responden yang berpartisipasi dalam penelitian ini sebanyak 112 orang dengan mayoritas mahasiswa non-kesehatan (75%). Sebagian besar responden tahu (96,4%) dan berpersepsi paham mengenai makna dari PHW pada bungkus rokok (98,2%). Pencatuman PHW pada bungkus rokok membuat responden peduli terhadap bahaya merokok (87,5%) dan bersikap mendukung pencantuman PHW (98,2%). Pencantuman PHW pada bungkus rokok menciptakan rasa takut untuk mulai merokok (98,2%) dan semakin takut jika ukuran gambar diperbesar (81,3%). Mahasiswa Universitas Udayana memiliki pengetahuan dan sikap yang baik terhadap PHW pada bungkus rokok, serta memiliki persepsi bahwa PHW yang berlaku saat ini telah efektif untuk memberikan rasa takut dan meningkatkan kepedulian terhadap dampak kesehatan akibat merokok. Kata Kunci: Mahasiswa, Pictorial Health Warning, Rokok ABSTRACT The number of smokers in Indonesia has increased from year to year. Smoking among young people is a common phenomenon. Age 15-19 years is the age of most smoking starts, which is classified as starting college age. The Indonesian government is trying to reduce the number of smokers by setting regulations regarding the inclusion of pictorial health warnings (PHW) on cigarette packs. This study aims to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of Udayana University students on PHW on cigarette packs descriptively. This cross-sectional study was conducted at 13 Faculties at Udayana University, involving all active students in the 2018/2019 school year, with sampling taken accidentally. Sample characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and students' perceptions of PHW were obtained by questionnaire. Data were analyzed univariately with a statistical package software for Windows. 112 respondents participated in this study with the majority of non-health students (75%). Most respondents knew (96.4%) and thought they understood the meaning of PHW on cigarette packages (98.2%). The inclusion of PHW on cigarette packs made respondents concerned about the dangers of smoking (87.5%) and was supportive of the inclusion of PHW (98.2%). The inclusion of PHW on cigarette packs creates fear to start smoking (98.2%) and is even more afraid if the image size is enlarged (81.3%). Udayana University students have good knowledge and attitude towards PHW on cigarette packs, as well as having a perception that the current PHW has been effective in giving fear and increasing concern for the health effects of smoking.
