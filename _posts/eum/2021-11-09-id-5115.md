This study found that the potentials of domestic culture can be used as a form of sports. Legong dance is one of popular Balinese tradisional art which has dynamic movements with duration of 20 minutes. A randomized pre-test and post-test contol group design was carried out to compare the effectiveness of the Balinese Legong dance with Senam Ayo Bersatu (one of aerobic dance) in improving physical fitness and reducing body fat. Thirty samples who came from the sixth and eighth semester in the Faculty of Medicine Udayana University were divided into three different groups: I (Legong dance intervention), II (Senam Ayo Bersatu intervention), and control (without intervention).
