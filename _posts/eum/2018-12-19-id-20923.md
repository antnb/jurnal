To diagnose accurately, early examination is needed. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen is one examination that is used as a new biomarker in the early diagnosis of dengue infection. Several studies have been conducted expressing the importance of NS1 antigen as a biomarker because it can be detected before antibodies are formed.The study design was retrospective study by taking the data of patients undergoing examination dengue NS1 antigen in Niki Diagnostic Center in 2011-2012.
