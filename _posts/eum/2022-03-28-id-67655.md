Based on the analysis, allergic rhinitis (RP= 2.09 IK95%= 1.1-3.72 p= 0.01), atopic dermatitis (RP=4.33 IK95%=2.34-8.02 p=0.0001), and atopic diseases in family (RP= 2.56 IK95%=1.42-4.63 p=0.001), had a significant difference result with the prevalence of asthma. Besides, obesity (RP=0.98 IK95%=0.48-2.0 p=0.96), passive smokers (RP=1.52 IK95%=0.84-2.74 p=0.16), and fast food consumption (RP=1.24 IK95%=0.65-2.35 p=0.51), did not have any significant different result with the prevalence of asthma.
