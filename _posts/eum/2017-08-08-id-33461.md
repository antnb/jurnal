According to some data in 2011 showed total diabetes patients in Sanglah Hospital, Bali as many as 974 people. This study uses a cross-sectional study to determine the relationship between Total Lymphocyte Count (TLC) with nutritional status in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus hospitalizations in Sanglah Hospital.

Of all the samples studied, a total of 91 patients (92.9%) who experienced various complications whereas only 7 patients (7.1%) is DM patients without complications. From the Post-Hoc test was obtained was not significant when seen differences in the number of lymphocytes among the five complications with the group that there are no complications. When analyzed further to determine the mean difference by looking at the results of the analysis of Post Hoc to three groups of nutritional status, the data showed that the group's nutritional status well with the medium, p &lt;0.001, CI 95% not covered numbers 0 and between groups of nutrients well with bad p &lt;0.001, CI 95% not covered zeros. Thus, the difference TLC significantly different between both groups of nutrients with moderate or good with the bad. Keywords: Diabetes mellitus (DM), Total Lymphocyte Count (TLC), nutrients."
