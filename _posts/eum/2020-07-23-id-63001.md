## Abstract:
"ABSTRAKPada banyak kasus penyebab ketuban pecah dini (KPD) tidak diketahui secara pasti. Karakteristikibu bersalin seperti usia kehamilan, usia ibu, tingkat pendidikan, pekerjaan ibu, riwayat KPDsebelumnya, dan gravida dapat mempengaruhi kejadian KPD. Berdasarkan hal tersebut perludilakukan penelitian untuk mengetahui karakteristik ibu bersalin dengan KPD di RSUP SanglahDenpasar periode Juli 2015-Juni 2016. Penelitian ini menggunakan rancangan deskriptifretrospektif dengan sampel penelitian adalah semua data rekam medis ibu bersalin dengan KPDdi ruang VK dan Poli Obstetri dan Ginekologi RSUP Sanglah Denpasar periode Juli 2015-Juni2016. Pemilihan sampel dilakukan dengan cara purposive sampling. Rekam medis pasiendilakukan tabulasi data dan prosedur analisis data deskriptif. Data yang telah terkumpulditampilkan dalam bentuk tabel dan narasi. Hasil penelitian didapatkan 166 ibu bersalin denganKPD yang terdiri dari KPD aterm sebanyak 142 orang (85,5%) dan KPD preterm sebanyak 24orang (14,5%). Sebanyak 80 orang (56,3%) ibu bersalin dengan KPD aterm adalah pada usiakehamilan 37-38 minggu, sedangkan pada KPD preterm mendapat hasil seimbang antara usiakehamilan &lt;34 minggu dan 34-36 minggu yaitu 12 orang (50%). Ibu bersalin dengan KPD baikpada kehamilan aterm maupun preterm terbanyak pada usia 20-35 tahun [aterm = 105 orang(73,9%), preterm = 21 orang (87,5%)]. Banyak ditemukan ibu bersalin dengan KPD baik padakehamilan aterm ataupun preterm dengan faktor risiko pendidikan sedang (SMP-SMA) [aterm =115 orang (81%), preterm = 20 orang (83,3%)]. Pekerjaan ibu rumah tangga memiliki jumlahyang lebih tinggi baik pada kehamilan aterm maupun preterm [aterm = 77 orang (54,2%), preterm= 12 orang (50%)]. Selanjutnya ibu bersalin dengan KPD baik pada kehamilan aterm ataupun preterm tanpa adanya riwayat KPD sebelumnya memiliki jumlah yang tinggi [aterm = 113 orang (93,7%), preterm = 24 orang (100%)]. Untuk gravida, kejadian KPD tertinggi baik padakehamilan aterm maupun preterm adalah gravida 1 [aterm = 54 orang (38%), preterm = 10 orang(41,7%)]. Didapatkan data ibu bersalin yang paling banyak mengalami KPD adalah padakehamilan aterm. Ibu bersalin dengan KPD aterm terbanyak pada usia kehamilan 37-38 minggu,sedangkan pada KPD preterm mendapat hasil seimbang antara usia kehamilan &lt;34 minggu dan34-36 minggu. Ibu bersalin dengan KPD baik pada kehamilan aterm maupun preterm terbanyakpada usia 20-35 tahun, dengan faktor risiko pendidikan sedang (SMP-SMA), pekerjaan sebagaiibu rumah tangga, tanpa adanya riwayat KPD sebelumnya serta gravida 1.Kata kunci: Ketuban pecah dini, aterm, preterm, usia kehamilan, usia ibu, pendidikan, pekerjaan,riwayat KPD, gravida, RSUP Sanglah. ABSTRACTIn many cases the cause of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is unknown. Maternalcharacteristics such as gestational age, maternal age, education level, maternal occupation, historyof previous PROM and gravida can influence the incidents of PROM. Based on this background,it necessary to research to find the characteristics of pregnancy with PROM at Sanglah Hospitalin July 2015-June 2016. A retrospective descriptive design study with sample are all patientmedical records with PROM in VK and Polyclinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology at SanglahHospital in July 2015-June 2016. The sample was selected by purposive sampling, tabulated andanalyzed based on descriptive data analysis procedures. Data results presented in tabular formand narrative. From the results of 166 patints with PROM were devided become term PROM is142 persons (85.5%) and preterm PROM is 24 persons (14.5%). In term PROM, the gestationalage of patient were higher in 37-38 weeks gestation is 80 persons (56.3%), preterm PROM gotbalanced outcome between gestational age &lt;34 weeks and 34-36 weeks is 12 people (50%). Theincidence of PROM in both term and preterm pregnancies were higher in patient age of 20-35years [term = 105 (73.9%), preterm = 21 (87.5%)]. In education level, the incidence of PROMboth term and preterm pregnancies are in moderate level of education (SMP-SMA) [term = 115(81%), preterm = 20 (83.3%)]. The occupation as a housewife has a higher incidence in both termand preterm pregnancies [term = 77 (54.2%), preterm = 12 (50%)]. The incidence of PROM inboth term and preterm pregnancies were higher in cases without any history of previous PROM[term = 113 (93.7%), preterm = 24 (100%)]. The incidence of PROM in both term and pretermpregnancies were higher in gravida 1 [term = 54 (38%), preterm = 10 (41.7%)]. The incidents ofPROM were higher in term pregnancies. In term PROM, the gestational age of patient were higherin 37-38 weeks gestation, whereas the preterm PROM got a balanced outcome betweengestational age &lt;34 weeks and 34-36 weeks. The incidence of PROM in both term and pretermpregnancies were higher in patient age of 20-35 years, with a moderate level of education (SMPSMA),work as a housewife, with no history of previous PROM and occurin gravida 1.
