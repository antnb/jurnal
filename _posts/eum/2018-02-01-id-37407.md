The prevalence of overweight was 12.2% (296 respondents) and obesity was 5.4%. The result of this study show that the prevalence of overweight and obesity in urban areas (14.2% and 7.4%) is higher than rural areas (10.1% and 3.4%), p value=0.067 (p&gt;0.05). So, it can be said there is no statistically significant difference.
