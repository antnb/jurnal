There were significant differences in the value of the quality of life of patientswith cervical cancer squamous cell stage IIB - IIIB before and after BOMP chemotherapy with 0.001p value. BOMP chemotherapy regimens can improved the quality of life of cervical cancer patientsincreasing from 44.833 ± 6.235 to 60.333 ± 9.168. In 15 ratings domain included decrease the qualityof life of pain domain, nausea domain, vomiting domain, decreased appetite domains, fatigue domain,physical function domain, functional role domain, social functioning domain, sleeplessness domain,constipation domain and domain of financial difficulties and on the other hand emotional domainincrease."
