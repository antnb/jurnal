Size parameters observed were chest circle, stomach circle, flank circle,shoulder height, spine height, hip heigh and length of the body. This study showed that those three treatment resulted in similar body size of local boar. It can be concluded that supplementation of lysine, methionine and choline as much as 0,5% and 1% give similar results as control on all of the body size observed.
