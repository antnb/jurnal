The experiment designd used was Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with three treatments, namely treatments P0 (Ration without fermented papaya leaf meal as controls), P1 (Ration contain of 8% fermented papaya leaf meal), and P2 (Ration contain of 16% fermented papaya leaf meal), treatment consists of three replications and each replication using two female bali ducks aged 12 weeks with an average initial weight range of 1286.23 ± 92.88 g. The variables observed were weight and percentage commercial carcasspieces of chest, thigh, drumstick, wings and backs. The results showed that the use of ration containing 8% and 16% fermented papaya leaf meal is statistically not significant (P&gt;0.05) on commercial carcass pieces. The weight of commercial carcass pieceswere increased ondrumstick, wings and backs on the treatment P1, but statistically not significant different (P&gt;0.05). Based on the results of this research, it can be concluded that administration of fermented papaya leaf meal at level of 8% and 16% had no effect on commercial carcass of female bali ducks.
