## Abstract:
"This study aims to determine and provide information about the growth and yield of Benggala grass ( Panicum maximum ) which is planted with legumes Alysicarpus vaginalis with different doses of Urea (N) and Phosphorus (P) fertilizers. The study was conducted at the Sesetan Research Station, Faculty of Animal Husbandry, Udayana University on Jalan Sesetan. The research lasted for 12 weeks, using a complete randomized design (CRD) split plot pattern consisting of main plots ie 1 Panicum maximum cropping pattern without Alysicarpus vaginalis (A0), 1 Panicum maximum + 1 Alysicarpus vaginalis (A1), 1 Panicum maximum+ 2 Alysicarpus vaginalis (A2), 1 Panicum maximum + 3 Alysicarpus vaginalis (A3), and subplots consist of four doses, namely N0P0 kg/ha (D0), N50P25 kg/ha (D1), N50P50 kg/ha (D2), N75P50 kg/ha (D3) there were 16 treatment combinations and were repeated three times so that there were 48 experimental units. The variables observed were growth, yield and characteristics of plant growth. The results showed that the growth and yield of Panicum maximum grass on the number of A0 legumes had the highest mean on the variable number of leaves, number of tillers, leaf dry weight, stem dry weight and total forage dry weight. The highest average D3 fertilizer dose on the variable dry weight of leaves, root dry weight and total forage dry weight were statistically significant. The conclusion of this research Panicum maximum grass that is grown without legumes Alysicarpus vaginalis provide the best growth and d osis fertilizer N75P50 kg / ha give the best response in the Panicum maximum grass and interaction between mixed cropping amount of legumes with a dose of fertilizer N and P on stem dry weight, root dry weight and total forage dry weight. Keywords : Growth, Yield, Panicum maximum, Alysicarpus vaginalis, Urea, Phosphorus"
