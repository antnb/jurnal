The experimental design used was a completely randomized design (CRD) which consist of 3 treatments and 3 replications. The treatments were P0 (ration without supplementation of papaya leaf meal fermented), P1 (ration with supplementation of 8% papaya leaf meal fermented), and P2 (ration with supplementation of 16% papaya leaf meal fermented). The variables observed were weight of the head, legs, neck, blood and feathers. The results showed that the ration with fermented papaya leaf meal supplementation did not give a significant effect (P&gt; 0.05) to the weight of the external offal (head, legs, neck, blood and feathers) bali ducks age 26 weeks. Based on these results it can be concluded that supplementation of 8% and 16% flour fermented papaya leaves in ration does not affect the external offal of the bali duck 26 weeks and the ration can be used as an alternative feed ingredient because a cheaper price ration.
