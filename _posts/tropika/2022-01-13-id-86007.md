## Abstract:
"This study aimed to in-vivo analyze the level of rumen fermentation of Bali cattle fed fermented rations by 3 types of lignocellulolytic bacterial inoculants from the Bali cattle colon and organic waste produced by Mudita et al. (2015) namely: inoculants with code BS12K12; BS12K1; and BS1K12.The research held at The Research Station Education Farm, Bukit Jimbaran, Badung, Bali and Laboratory of Nutrition and Feed Animal, Faculty of Animal Husbandry, Udayana University in 3 (three) months, with 4 (four) total collection periods. The research has been done by The Latin Square Design, with 4 (four) treatment and 4 periode researching as replicated. The treatments were: RB0 = bali cattle fed ration fermented without bacteria innoculant (fermented molasses solution as control), RB1=bali cattle fed ration fermented bacteri innoculant BS12K12, RB2=bali cattle fed ration fermented bacteri innoculant BS12K1, and RB3=bali cattle fed ration fermented bacteri innoculant BS1K12. The observation variables on this research are: pH, protozoa population, totally VFA and partial such as acetic acid, propionic acid, and butiric acid, and N-NH3 on the rumen fluid. The result of this research shows that the bali cattle fed ration fermented by inocullant of bali cattle colon and organic waste lignocellulolytic bacteria had increased (P&lt;0,05) the rumen metabolism rate of bali cattle, especially N-NH3, propionatic acid and totally VFA, without effecting the pH and population of protozoa on the bali cattle rumen liquid. Keywords: Rumen Metabolic, Lygnocellulolitic Bacteria Innoculant, Fermented Ration Bali Cattle Colon Bacteria Isolates, Organic Waste Bacteria Isolates"
