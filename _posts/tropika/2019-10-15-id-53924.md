## Abstract:
"This study aimed to obtain information about the growth and yield of Bengal grass (Panicum maximum cv. Trichoglume) which was planted with the legumes of Alysicarpus vaginalis at different dosage of N, P and K fertilizers. This research was conducted in the greenhouse of the Udayana University Faculty of Animal Science research station for 8 weeks, completely randomized design (CRD) Split Splot was used in this research pattern consisting of mainplot/plot, namely the number of Alysicarpus vaginalis: without legume Alysicarpus vaginalis (P0), 1 legume Alysicarpus vaginalis (PA1), 2 legumes of Alysicarpus vaginalis (PA2) and 3 legumes of Alysicarpus vaginalis (PA3), and subplots/subplots ie fertilizer dosage: treatment without fertilizer (D0), 50 kg/ha N + 25 kg/ha P2O5+ 25 kg/ha K2O (D1), 100 kg/ha N + 50 kg/ha P2O5+ 50 kg/ha K2O (D2).From the design 12 combinations were obtained, each combination was repeated 3 times so there were 36 experimental units. The results showed that there was no interaction between mixed cropping and N, P and K fertilizer dosage on all growth variables, yields, and growth characteristics.The Panicum maximum grass growth of planted with the Alysicarpus vaginalis legume statistically gave no significant effect on all growth, yields and growth characteristics variables. The treatment of NPK fertilizer dosage statistically gave no significant effect on all growth, yields, and growth characteristicsvariables.It can be concluded that the growth and yield of Panicum maximum grass tended to decrease with an increase in the number of Alysicarpus vaginalis legumes.The growth and yield of Panicum maximum grass tend to decrease with increasing fertilizer dosage.There was no interaction between the number of legumes and the dosage of NPK fertilizer on the growth and production of Panicum maximum grass.
