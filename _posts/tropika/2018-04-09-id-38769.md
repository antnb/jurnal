The variables observed were final weight, carcass weight, carcass percentage, and percentage of carcass component.The results showed that chicken giving rations containing protein 14.5% (R1), rations containing protein 15.5% (R2) and rations containing protein 16.5% (R3) not different (P&gt;0.05) an all of the variables as of final weight, carcass weight, carcass percentage and percentage of carcass component. It can be concluded that chicken giving rations containing protein (14.5%, 15.5% and 16.5%) has no effect on the final weight, carcass weight, carcass percentage, and percentage of carcass component of kampung chicken at 11 weeks age.
