BT3CL through drinking water as much as 2,5 ml (B), ducks were given probiotic mix of Bacillus subtilis strain BR2CL and Bacillus sp. BT3CL through drinking water as much as 5ml (C). The observe of variables were included weight and percentage of commercial carcass pieces of upper thighs, lower thighs, wings, chest and back.
