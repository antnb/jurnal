The results showed that TPC in Sanglah markets was 2.77 x 108 cfu/g, TPC in Kreneng market was 4.52 x 107 cfu/g, TPC in Badung pasar was 7.50 x 107 cfu/g and TPC in Pemedilan market was 4.87 x 107 cfu/g. Coliform in Sanglah market was 7.21 x 106 cfu/g, Coliform in Kreneng market was 4.42 x 106 cfu/g, Coliform in Badung market was 6.17 x 106 cfu/g, and Coliform in Pemedilan market was 5.10 x 106 cfu/g. Escherichia coli in Sanglah market was 6.25 x 105 cfu/g, Kreneng market 4.12 x 105 cfu/g, Badung market 3.55 x 106 cfu/g and Pemedilan market 4.72 x 104 cfu/g. The water degree in Sanglah market 75.39% 74.54% Kreneng market, Badung market 75.50% and Pemedilan market 75.86%.
