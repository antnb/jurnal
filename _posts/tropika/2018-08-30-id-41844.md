The design used was Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 6 replication and three treatments: storage using wooden box, wire box and carton egg tray at average temperature 25oC. The variables observed on egg quality test were egg weight, egg index, thick of shell, heavy of shell, yolk color, egg pH, Hought Unit egg. The result showed that storage area egg tray had significant effect (P &lt;0,05) to the Hought Unit egg compared wooden box and wire box. While the treatment wooden box and wire box to weight of egg, egg index, thick of shell, yolk colour and pH of egg showed non significant effect (P&gt; 0,05).
