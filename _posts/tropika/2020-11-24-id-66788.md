The design used a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) consisting of 4 treatments and 4 repeating and in every repeating consisted of 3 crossbred chickens White Gold X Lancy. The treatments are, R0: Without addition of dragon fruit peel juice through drinking water, R1: Addition of 5% dragon fruit peel juice through drinking water, R2: Addition 10% of dragon fruit peel juice through drinking water and R3: Addition of 15% of dragon fruit peel juice through drinking water. The observed variables were head weight, neck weight, leg weight, blood weight, and hair weight. The results showed that treatments R1, R2, and R3 had a higher weight on the head, neck and legeach 4,71%, 4,21% and 8,83% than R0 significant different (P&lt;0,05), but not significant different (P&gt;0,05) weight on the bload and hair weight. Based on the result, it can be concluded that addition of dragon fruit peel as much as 5%, 10% and 15% affacted weight of head, neck and foot but not affected weight of blood and hair crossing chicken White Gold X Lancy aged 6-14 weeks.
