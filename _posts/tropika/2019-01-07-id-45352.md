The results showed that the average characteristics of fresh semen of bali bull at Baturiti Artificial Insemination Center in October 2018 consisted of semen volume were 6,7 ml, semen of bali’s bull dominated by the cream color, individual motility percentage were 69%, spermatozoa concentration were 1.175 million/ml and the production of frozen semen is 15.343 straw. The conclusions showed in general the characteristics of fresh semen of bali bull at Baturiti Artificial Insemination Center include volume, color, percentage of individual motility, spermatozoa concentration in accordance with standards and the amount of frozen semen production according to target and frozen semen is suitable for distribution.
