Evaluation of enzyme activity by eight lignolytic bacteria isolated from earthworm Lumbricus rubellus on weeds crops especially water hyacint and water lettuc e leaves had been carried out for have the best lignolytic bacteria as weeds crops degrader The experiment was conducted with completely randomized design CRD 8 treatments and 3 replications treatments based on the eight cellulolignolytic bacteria isolates coded EB1LG EB2LG EB3LG EB4LG EB5LG EB6LG EB7LG and EB8LG Lignase enzyme activity measured on 4 four incubation time periods were 10 20 "
