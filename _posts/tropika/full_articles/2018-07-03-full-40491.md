The research aims to evaluated the effect of fed ration fermented by superior lignocellulolytic bacteria of bali cattle colon and organic waste towards the digestibility of nutrients bali cattle and to know the formula of inoculant which is able to produce ration with better nutrient content This research uses the latin square design with four treatments and four replicates The treatments consists of rations fermented without superior inoculant PSB0 fermented rations with the best bacteria culture 1 2 of bali cattle colon and best 1 2 of organic waste PS"
