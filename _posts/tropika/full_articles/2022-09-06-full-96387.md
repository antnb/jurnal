Efforts to improve broiler performance can be done by using fermentation technology on rations with lignocellulolytic probiotic bacteria This research was carried out to know the nutritional content of the starter phase of broiler rations fermented using lignocellulolytic probiotic bacteria and know the best bacteria from the fermented rations This study used a completely randomized design CRD with four treatments and four replications namely fermented starter phase broiler ration without lignocellulolytic probiotic bacteria RB0 inoculum fermented starter"
