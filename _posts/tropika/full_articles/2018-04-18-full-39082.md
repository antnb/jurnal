The effort to increase the productivity of Heteropogon contortus grass in particular can be done by giving organic fertilizer one of which is fertilizer or waste result from the process of manufacture of biogas often referred as slurry and bioslurry The research aimed to find out the effect of substitution of urea fertilizer with bioslurry and cow slurry towards growth and production Heterpogon contortus grass The experiment using Completely Randomized Design RAL consisted of seven treatments and four replicates therefore there were 28 units of experiment"
