This study aimed to determine the effect of different types of inoculant fermentation in broiler litter fermentation on dry matter and organic matter digestibility and metabolite products and to determine the inoculants that produced the highest dry matter and organic matter digestibility and metabolite products among Yeast EM4 and BioBaliTani The study used a completely randomized design CRD consisting of 4 treatments namely litter without fermentation LF0 EM4 inoculants Effective Microorganism 4 LF1 yeast inoculants Saccharomyces cerevisiae LF"
