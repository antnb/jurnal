Evaluation of ability on degrading agricultural waste by eight cellulolytic bacteria isolated from earthworm Lumbricus rubellus had been carried out for have the best cellulolytic bacteria as weeds crops degrader The experiment was conducted with completely randomized design CRD 8 treatments and 3 replications treatments based on the eight cellulolytic bacteria isolates with the code EB1CL EB2CL EB3CL EB4CL EB5CL EB6CL EB7CL and EB8CLEvaluated of degrade ability measure by diameters of clear zone on agricultural waste were rice straw rice bran wate"
