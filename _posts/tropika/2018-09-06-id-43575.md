The experimental design used was Completely Randomized Design (CRD) consisted of 4 treatments and 4 replicates. So, there were 16 of experimental units. The treatments were: A = commercial diet without Agnihotra ash (control), B = Commercial diet + 0.1% Agnihotra ash, C = Commercial diet + 0.2% Agnihotra ash and D = Commercial diet + 0.3% Agnihotra ash. The variables observed were weight of head, neck, foot, blood and feather. The results showed that Agnihotra ash on the level of 0.1%-0.3% in commercial diet not significanly increase (P&gt;0,05) the weight of external offal broiler aged 5 weeks. Based on the results of this study it can be concluded that Agnihotra ash at the level of 0.1%-0.3% in diet did not affect on external offal (the weight of head, neck, leg, blood and feather) broiler on the age of 5 weeks.
