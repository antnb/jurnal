Each treatment consisted of five replications and each replication used three male bali ducks aged 3 days with an average body weight of 55,72 ± 7.16 g. The variables observed were the weight and percentage of commercial carcasses pieces of the chest, upper thighs, lower thighs, wings, and back. The results showed that the administration of Effective Microoganism-4 probiotics through drinking water in the level of 1% significantly (P &lt;0.05) increasing the weight of chest section by12.45%, the weight of the other carcass pieces were not significantly effect (P&gt;0,05). The percentage of commercial carcass pieces also showed not significantly different (P&gt; 0.05).
