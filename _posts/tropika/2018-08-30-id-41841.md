Variables observed were volume, color, odor, consistency, pH, motility, concentration and viability.Results of the researchshowed that the T1, T2, and T3 were no change on volume, color, smell, and consistency.Whereas pH, motility, concentration and viability were significantdifference (P&lt;0.05) within the treatmentT1, T2 and T3.It could be concluded that 5 minutes thawing length at TSU of AIC Baturiti was the best, while at TSU of AIC Buruan it was 3 minutes.
