## Abstract:
"In order to know the effect of GFRP plates on increasing capacity ofreinforced concrete beams, an experiment on reinforced concrete beamsstrengthened by GFRP plates is made. This experiment is focused on finding theeffects of bounding GFRP plates to the side surfaces of the beams on increasingcapacity of the beams.In this experiment the effect of adding GFRP plates having fiber directions of00/900, ±450 and 00 to the increasing shear capacity of reinforced concrete sectionwas studied. The beams had section dimension of 100 cm by 150 cm and length950 cm. The GFRP plates were added on the two side surfaces of the beams bycovering the surfaces with epoxy resin and then add glass fiber in the form ofwoven roving in the direction needed and finally cover again with the epoxy. Thebeams were simply supported and subjected to four points load. Data recordedwere the load-deflection at every step of loading until failure and modes of failureof the beams. The result shows that the beams without GFRP fail in shear failure mode and thebeams with GFRP fail in flexural failure mode. More over, addition of GFRP to thebeams increases the load capacity of the beams by 12.48% averagely. The fiberdirection gives a slight difference to the increasing capacity and the amount of theincreasing capacity given by the fiber direction of 0o/90o, 0o, and ±45o are 13.744%,11.374%, and 12.322% respectively. Theoretically the fiber direction of ±45oshould gives the highest value, but this is not happen because of de-bounding of theGFRP plate from the surface of the beams."
