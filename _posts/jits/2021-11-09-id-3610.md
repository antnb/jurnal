## Abstract:
"Recently, the infrastructure condition of drainage network system inDenpasar cannot overcome flood problem which happens every rainy season.This problem has been resulted due to lack of drainage network systemmanagement related to the increasing in housing area development, the changingof land use, and other activities which cause risk of flood. One of the causes, i.e.risk identification especially for major risks has not yet been available as a baseto undertake mitigation of consequences. Therefore, there is a need to conduct astudy on drainage network system, in order to control the risks that are likelyoccurred and particularly has widely affected to the aspect of planning,development, operational and maintenance. This research identified 91 risks,including 13 risks found from previous study. The distribution of risk acceptance for planning, operational and maintenance of flood mitigation in Denpasar isclassified as unacceptable risk by 27 (29,67%); undesirable risks by 26 (28,57%);acceptable risks by 35 (38,46%); and negligible risks by 3 (3,30%). Riskmitigation is only conducted for dominant risks that are categorized asunacceptable and undesirable risks. There are 27 of risk mitigation conducted forunacceptable risks, that covers 10 (37,04%) of planning risks, 4 (14,81%) ofexecution risks and 13 (48,15%) of maintenance and operasional risks. Riskmitigation for undesirable categories consist of 26 risks; these are 10 (38,46%) ofplanning risks, 7 (26,92%) execution risks and 9 (34,62%) of operasional andmaintenance risks. Subsequently, management of risk ownership is addressed tothe parties that involved in flood mitigation in Denpasar."
