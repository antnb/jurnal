## Abstract:
"The stability of the slope, a soil surface that forms an angle to thehorizontal plane, on the road in the Bantas village, East Selemadeg District,Tabanan Regency is discusses in this paper. The road which connects the city ofDenpasar-Gilimanuk is always packed with traffic flow. Landslides that occurredduring the rainy season in January 2006 caused long traffic jams, the changes in thecontour slopes and the possibility for landslide aftershocks. Slope stability analysisis conduced on naturally slope contour and that with the traffic loading. The analysis was carried out using the simplified Bishop’s Method by dividing theslope into three parts according to soil type and location of its coordinates. Basedon the results conducted on slope stability analysis for type 1 soil both at thebottom and at the top of the road, the average safety factor of slope stability wasless than 1. To prevent the occurrence of landslides, it was planned an alternativeform of construction namely cantilever retaining walls with reinforced concrete atthe bottom of the road and gravity retaining walls with stone at the top of the roaduntil reaching a stable rate (Fs &gt; 1.5).The results obtained for the upper slopes of the road built with 1.5 meters retainingwalls of gravity type (with ribs) are number of safety of overturning and shearstability which is greater than 1.5 and the actual bearing capacity which is smallerthan its allowable bearing capacity. Likewise for the slope at the bottom of the roadafter the 8 meters cantilever wall was built, the results obtained meet the safetyrequirements."
