## Abstract:
"In the construction project activity, planning is used as a reference by theimplementation unit and become a standard of the project implementation, andincludes: technical specifications, schedule and budgeting. Inaccurate planning,imperfect investigation of the project location, lack of experience and ability inmanaging the project and lack of professionalism of the service provider areclosely linked to the result of the process of a construction project (projectperformance). This research is conducted within the physical activityscope/construction stage that aims to find out the relation between influence qualitycontrol of the implementation plan and the performance of the construction project(cost and time performances). Primary data is obtained from questionnaries and is analyzed using SPSS. Theresearch found that the regression model chosen is nonlinear regression modelwhere the equation Y1=1,122+0.282X1+0,208X3+0,292X15+0,325X19+0,318X9 andY2=1,187+0.395X2+0,310X5+0,263X16+0,196X6+0,247X11 is for cost factor andtime factor respectively. The coefficients found in each regression model havepositive value. This shows that there is positive correlation between quality controlof the implementation plan and the construction project performance.Factors affecting the cost performances are quality of planning resources fordrawing design, quality of bidding of the service provider, quality control ofservice provider resources, the design revision, the project controlling while for thetime performances there are quality of design drawing, quality of technical biddingcontractors, quality of the project controlling, quality of service provider resources,and project implementation planning."
