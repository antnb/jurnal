## Abstract:
"Damage to roads that often occurs can form cracks, holes, or the sagged;one of the reasons is lack of gradation of aggregate used in accordance with therequirements. The problem is that it is difficult to determine the appropriateproportion aggregate mix gradation in accordance with specifications and there is alack of understanding of the effect given to the characteristics of the mixture due tothe variation obtained in the range of gradation specifications. The research conducted is to examine the characteristics of the variation of theaggregate gradation value, to analyze the characteristics of Laston mixture resultedfrom aggregate gradation variations, as well as to determine the effect of variationgiven by aggregate gradation on the characteristics of the Laston.The test results show the characteristics values as follows. Variation 1: Stability isof 1123.87 kg (spec.&gt;750 kg), flow 4.96 mm (spec.&gt;2 mm), MQ 226.59 kg/mm(spec.&gt;180 kg/mm), VMA is of 13.68% that is not meet specifications (spec.&gt;15%),VIM 4.453% (spec. 3%-6%), VFB 67.87% (spec.&gt;63%). Variation 2: Stability is of1135.37 kg (spec.&gt;750 kg), flow 4.64 mm (spec.&gt;2 mm), MQ 244.76 kg/mm(spec.&gt;180 kg/mm), VMA 15.48% (spec.&gt;15%), VIM 5.122% (spec. 3%-6%), VFB66.87% (spec.&gt;63%). Ideal Gradation: Stability is of 1143.99 kg (spec.&gt;750 kg),flow of 3.653 mm (spec.&gt;2 mm), MQ 313.21 kg / mm (spec.&gt;180 kg/mm), VMA16.48% (spec.&gt;15%), VIM 5.901% (spec. 3%-6%), VFB 64.2% (spec.&gt;63%).Variation 3: Stability is of 1160.58 kg (spec.&gt;750 kg), flow 3.49 mm (spec.&gt;2 mm),MQ 333.81 kg/mm (spec.&gt;180 kg/mm), VMA 16.57% (spec.&gt;15%), VIM is 6.06%which has not met the specification (spec. 3%-6%), VFB 63.44% (spec.&gt;63%).Variation 4: Stability is of 1176.51 kg (spec.&gt;750 kg), flow 3.18 mm (spec.&gt;2 mm),MQ 370 kg/mm (spec.&gt;180 kg/mm), VMA 16.81% (spec.&gt;15%), VIM is of6.359% that has not met the specification (spec. 3%-6%), VFB is of 62.18% thathas not also met the specifications (spec.&gt;63%).Base on the analysis of variance, Ftest value for each characteristic of mixture(stability = 13.67, Flow = 104.81, MQ = 73.705, VMA = 14.675, VIM = 4.5138,VFB = 1.352) is greater than the Ftable value ( = 3.48) with an error rate () used is5%, degrees of freedom treatment is 4 and degrees of freedom random is 10. Thisproves that with the change in treatment (aggregate gradation variations) makes thedifferences in the characteristics of the Laston."
