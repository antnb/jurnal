## Abstract:
"Evaluation of building design consultant performance is needed, becausemost of strategic decisions and project costs depend on the consultant performancethat is implemented in project design documents. The Analytical Hierarchy Process(AHP) method can be used as a reference for assessing the consultant performancein more detail and measurable. The hierarchy of assessment criterions was obtained from the interview in whichthe respondents were building design experts and it was combined with relevantliteratures. The analysis using the AHP method was conducted to compare theimportance level of criterion using pair-comparison matrixes. The weight ofcriterion and sub criterion were calculated by using eigen vector.The result of this study indicates that Quality of Design Document is the mostimportant criterion (41,8%), followed by Relevancy with Term Of Reference(26%), Time Schedule ( 17,7%), and Design Cost (14,5%), which presented atlevel 2. At level 3, Consistency of Design Document is the most important criterion(13,9%), followed by Constructability of Design Document (11,3%), Accuracy ofDesign Document (10,6%), and so on. The last criterion, which has the smallestassessment weight, is the Goal Achievement of the Preparation Phase (4,6%). Atlevel 4, Consistency among Engineering Drawing Document, Specification andCost Estimate is the most important sub-criterion (6,9%), followed by RationalTime Schedule (5,8%), Equivalency of Remuneration with Project Requirement(5,7%) and so on. The last criterion is positioned by Explanation of ConstructionMaterial, which has the smallest assessment weight (0,7%). Based on theassessment hierarchy, which has been completed with global weight of allcriterions, hence the tables of assessment system for building design consultantperformance can be made. Accordingly, the consultants can be classified accordingto their performance levels."
