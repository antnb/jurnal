## Abstract:
"The results of previous research on standard Pejaten ceramic tile andPejaten ceramic tile with natural pozzolan pumice, complied with the Ceramic TileRegulation of Indonesia NI-19, showed that none of those ceramic tiles resisted thewater infiltration. The tiles constituent only received once grinding during the fabrication process. It was shown from ceramic tile industry in Darmasaba thatthere were physically differences between ceramic tiles with once and twicegrinding. The ceramic tiles with twice grinding process had clear noise, smoothtexture and fine crack at the surface. In order to improve the strength of the ceramictiles, it was decided to conduct a research on ceramic tile characteristic with twicegrinding process.The characteristic of the ceramic tiles to be determined were dry shrinkage, burntshrinkage, bending strength, water infiltration and water absorption. The ceramictile specimens were mixed with a ratio of 1:0.15 of clay : paras pollen batched byvolume with a sufficient water amount. The research variable was a number ofgrinding.The result showed that the ceramic tiles with once grinding had an average waterabsorption of 24,80%, the average water infiltration in 3 hours was 8,6 mm and theceramic tile was un-resistance to the water infiltration. The average bendingstrength of whole tile was 86 kg and the flat surface of the tile was 26 kg. Theaverage of dry and burnt shrinkage was 7,2% and 2,2% in long direction and 6,7%and 2,1% in short direction. The bending curvature equal to 6,35 cm. The tiles withtwice grinding had an average water absorption of 22,25%, the average waterinfiltration in 3 hours was 8,1mm and the ceramic tiles was categorized resistanceto the water infiltration. The average bending strength of whole tiles was 89 kg andthe flat surface of the tiles was 28 kg. The average of dry and burnt shrinkage was6,9% and 1,9% in long direction and 6,3% and 1,8% in short direction. Thebending curvature equal to 6,11 cm. The ceramic tiles were classified as the qualityIV."
