## Abstract:
"The development of transport technology and human’s culture, whichusually require all thing must goes fastly, often makes human being especiallychildren as victims including traffic accident victims. In terms of road safety in thesurrounding school, students hopefully come and leave their school safely bydeveloping Safe School’s Zone (SSZo). SSZo is a zone on a link-road at thesurroundings of school which traffic speed is based on certain time. By trafficmanagement and traffic engineering, the safe school zone is equipped withsupporting building and complement facility to control strictly the speed of throughtraffic. For this reason, in the safe school zone, the traffic hopefully will be safe,comfort, easy to be found and economic. In this study, it will be discussed theimportance of SSZo, the types of SSZo, supporting building and complementfacility needed and also some actions that should be carried out to make itsmanagement successfull."
