## Abstract:
"This paper covers investigation which was carried out in the UnitedKingdom (UK), where utilization of waste materials in building industry had beenencouraged in line with the UK government strategy to reduce waste disposal tolandfill. The investigation was about building block named as Masonryblock, amasonry building block material that incorporates waste materials, namely steelslag, crushed glass, and coal fly ash, bound with bitumen (asphalt). The binder usedwas 50 pen bitumen. The materials were hot mixed, statically compacted thencured at 200°C for 24 hours. The main properties of the blocks evaluated werecompressive strength, creep and volume stability due to moisture and thermalexposure. It was found that the Masonryblock compressive strength wascomparable or even can exceed the compressive strength of concrete blockcommonly used in the UK (2.8-10 MPa), and can satisfy creep strain &lt; 100microstrain. The volume stability of the Masonryblock was found affected bymoisture exposure. The samples expanded due to higher relative humidity and viceversa. On thermal exposure the samples expanded and the expansion was foundhighly reversible. The Masonryblocks gave coefficient of thermal expansioncomparable to clay bricks."
