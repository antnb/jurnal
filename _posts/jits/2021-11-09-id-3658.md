## Abstract:
"This study was an experimental study on spiral-shaped bond shearconnector that is used in steel-concrete composite beams. Spiral is made of mildsteel reinforcement that has the same dimension between its diameter and its feetdistance (single spiral). Specimens was designed according to Austaralian StandarAS 2327, Part 1, 1980 consisting of I shape steel profile and two concrete slabsattached to the flanges of the profile. Four types or groups of specimens were madewith the same strength of concrete (27.65 MPa) and steel. Two spirals withdiameter of 2 inch, 2.5 inch, 3 inch and 3.5 inch were applied in each specimenrespectively and each group of specimen was consisted of three identicalspecimens. Then the specimens were tested by the pushout test method untilfailure. The results of experimental study shows that this type bond shear connectorthat was made of steel reinforcing bars had given strength to bear shear force. Allspecimens experienced failure purely due to the slip (bond failure) between thespiral and concrete. Moreover, in elastic conditions there was no real differentbehavior among the specimen groups. Differences in behavior occured at postelasticcondition that was started from the compression force value of 120 kN (60kN for each spiral). The value of the failure compressive force for specimen group I, II, III and IV were 160 kN, 170 kN, 175 kN and 180 kN, respectively revealingthat there was consistency condition between the length of bond and the value ofthe failuer forces."
