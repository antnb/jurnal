## Abstract:
"In the implementation of construction projects, there is often adiscrepancy between the planned schedules and the work in the field, thus causingdelays. Many factors cause a delay, one way to anticipate is by doing theacceleration. In doing acceleration, cost and quality factors must be considered inorder to obtain the optimum cost and quality standards desired. Super VillaDevelopment Projects is selected for research studies because of delays in itsimplementation.Alternative acceleration used is the addition of working hours, from one hour tofour hours without any additional manpower. The calculation begins by finding thecritical path using Microsoft Project and then crashing is carried out to obtain costslope activities that are on critical path, then the analysis is performed using TimeCost Trade-Off Analysis. Finally, a graphic of the relationship between the costand the optimum time for each additional hour of work is created.From the analysis results, the optimum cost is obtained by adding one hour ofworks which reduce cost and time of Rp784,104.16 and eight days respectively,while the optimum time is obtained at additional two hours, with a reduction timeof 14 days and cost reduction of Rp700,377.35. This means that the acceleration with optimum cost is obtained when the addition is of one hour of work andoptimum time is obtained when the addition is of two hours of work."
