## Abstract:
"Computational Fluidal Dynamic (CFD analysis) is highly pointed tosolve a number of wind tunnel test problem on the computer simulation. Largeeddysimulation (LES) technique with the Smagorinsky eddy-viscosity model hasbeen applied in order to predict pressure coefficients for 3-D domes and catenoidmodels.“Fluent” has been used to analyze the flows. Published data of Maher and theASCE have been used as the basis guideline to enable wind loading to be appliedappropriately. Result of LES computations are compared with those from laminarmodels as well as those from turbulent models based on Reynolds–average Navier-Stokes equation (RANS model) and those from experiment. The numericalexperiment results for all models with various configurations to be exited by theturbulent wind forces were identified. The LES results from 3D computationalagreed very well with the experimental or published data. For the dome case ofh/d=1/2 ratio, the result can be sort it out into the maximum positive Cp=+0.621and the maximum negative in the centre of dome is Cp = -1.2. The coefficientoffered was quite similar to the published data of Cp=+0.6 and Cp=-1.0,respectively.CFD has been shown to a reasonable prediction of wind pressure distributions. Itconceivably could replace some wind tunnel tests."
