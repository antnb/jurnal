## Abstract:
"Lag screws are commonly used in knock down constructions where screwsis not possible. The resistance of the lag screws is provided by friction betweenthreaded parts and wood. This paper presents experimental investigation ofwithdrawal strength of lag screws embedded into Bangkiray woods. The objectives ofthe investigation were to determine the behavior of embedded screws subjected towithdrawal forces.To meet the experimental objectives, three specimens of an 8 mm diameter lag screwembedded into a 80 x 150 x 600 mm bangkiray woods were assembled and tested tofailure. The lag screws were 100 mm long with threaded length of 60 mm (effectivelength of 55 mm). However, in this experiment, only 40 mm of the threaded part waspenetrated into the main wood and giving the effective penetration length of 35 mm.Direction of the screw was perpendicular to wood grains. Two equal point loads wereapplied on both sides of the screws through two pieces of 50 x 70 x 500 mm bangkiraywoods connected using screws. The loads were increased incrementally every 1 kN or1kN/minute. Axial deformations of the screws were measured using a dial gaugelocated at the center of the lag screws for every load increment.The results show that failure modes occurred due to failure of the woods which werebearing failure of side beams and pull-out of the screws due to lose of main beamresistence. These types of failure were mainly dictated by the absence of washersbetween the bearing wood and the head of the screws. Slip of the embedded part atmaximum load is about 9.25% and 10.93% of the embedded length. The averagemaximum withdrawal strength of the screw embedded 40 mm into bangkiray wood is12.0 kN, excluding data of specimen S1. Prediction of withdrawal strength forembedment length of 60 mm is 24.10 kN."
