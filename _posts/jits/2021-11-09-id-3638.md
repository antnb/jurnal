## Abstract:
"Optimisation of public transport use (such as angkot or microbus) isrequired due to the difficulty to increase the roadway capacity by widening of roadin order to manage supply. Therefore, an alternative approach is required bymanaging transport demand so that the system can be controlled. This approach isrequired especially for the new developed housing in Dalung Village, BadungRegency. Dalung area (in North Kuta District) is part of Samigita developmentproject where the the number or people travelling to work are about 613 persons(189 persons working in public service and 424 persons in private company). Themajority of people in this area are travelling by private vehicles. One aspect thatneeds to be studied is the general cost for the journey to work both by privatevehicles (motor bikes) and public transport. Mode choice model used is BinomialLogit Model. The model equation is Log {(1 – PP ) / PP} = 2,248 – 0,001 (CP –CU). Results of analyses indicate that if the cost difference between publictransport and private transport increases, the probability of using private vehicleswill increase; Although the cost of the two modes of transportation is set at the samecost, the majority of workers will still use private vehicles (about 79%), and thisis also the case even when the cost difference is Rp 2.800,00. The cost balance between private vehicles and public transport is achieved when thecost of using private vehicles is about 1.4 times more than public transport cost."
