## Abstract:
"The Jehem reservoir tourism object which will be built side by side withthe Jehem reservoir, is located in the watershed of Melangit river and still in BangliHill Ecotourism area. This potential tourism object is of the indirect benefits(secondary benefit) from the reservoir development.Objective of the study is to analyze the financial feasibility on the tourism sectordevelopment in this area using methods of Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rateof Return (IRR), Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR), Payback Period (PP) and SensitivityAnalysis.Base on financial analysis it is obtained that the Net Present Value (NPV) is ofRp19,397,935,290.73, Internal Rate of Return (IRR) 23.22%, Benefit Cost Ratio1.802, and Payback Period will be achieved at the 9th year from the period ofinvestment planning for 20 years.With NPV value is greater than zero, IRR value is greater than the investment rate,and BCR value is greater than or equal to one, and Payback Period is reachedbefore the period of the investment plan achieved, then the investment plan iscategorized as feasible. The results of sensitivity analysis also show the feasiblevalues for this investment plan."
