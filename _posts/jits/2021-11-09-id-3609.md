## Abstract:
"Drenched rain soil is a cause in reduction of the soil strength in line withincreasing ground saturation. Reduction of this strength reduces the slope stabilitywhich can cause sliding during the rainy season. Research was conducted bycarrying out simulations on slopes using a Stable 2004 Program on different slopegeometries, number of terraces and soil properties. The effects of drenched rain soilwere simulated by changing ground water levels. The effects of slope geometriesincluding inclination and height of slopes and earthquake loads were considered inthe analyses. To ease the analyses, the terraces were grouped into 4 which were T1,T2, T3, and T4 having 1, 2, 3 and 4 terraces respectively. The slope without terraceis referred as T0, the slope inclination changed from 1:1 to 1:2 and 1:3 withdifferent type of soils (clay, sand and variation of clay-sand). The analysis resultsshowed that the increase in ground water level resulted in the reduction of slopestability for the slope of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, the safety factors increased withincreasing number of terraces and the highest was thus in T4. For Sandy slope of1:1 with T1 terrace, the increase in safety factor was noticeable, while for T2, T3,and T4 types they were almost the same. Sandy slopes of 1:2 and 1:3 with terraceschanging from T1 to T4 causes the average safety factor increase in slightly. Clayslope with earthquake loads of 0.25 g and 0.45 g gave the average reduction insafety factor of 43% and 55% respectively. The earthquake loads of 0.25 g and 0.45 g caused reductions on safety factors of sandy slopes by 50% and 70%respectively."
