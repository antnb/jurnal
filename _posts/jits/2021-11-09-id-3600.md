## Abstract:
"The construction of concrete structure usually uses a conventionalmethod where concrete mould and scaffolding used are made of wood. With theadvance of technology there is an alternative developed to replace that method withthe modern one. The slab structure constructed using metal deck is one example.The new method can provide a selection for entrepreneur of construction service todetermine the correct method in constructing the slab in order to give the maximumresult in term of cost and time aspects. To determine the construction method, the analyses of technique and cost ofconstruction are needed. The analysis of construction technique is conducted for allnetwork activities of works started from the work of scaffolding and concretemould, reinforcement until casting. The unit price analysis is carried out for thoseworks and more attention is paid to components affecting cost of material andlabors. The unit price analysis used is a unit price analysis according to Indonesianstandard, Standar Nasional Indonesia (SNI). The comparison is then conducted forcost analyses between conventional and metal deck slab cost of construction.Base on cost analysis results carried out on the building construction of Apartmentof Le Grande Suites Pecatu, it is found that the cost of construction of 1st and 2ndfloor using the conventional method and the metal deck construction are Rp.962.710.088,91. and Rp. 890.380.917,53, respectively. The comparison resultsindicate that the work of the conventional slab with the volume of 142,85 m3 ismore expensive than that of the metal deck slab with the volume of 121,99 m3,where the cost difference is equal to Rp 72.329.171,38 or 7,51%."
