## Abstract:
"Base on the existing conditions, garbage transportation in Amlapurastill faces problems. Garbage transportation in rush hour causes traffic jam. Theexisting temporary garbage place (TPS) has not been designed and equipped withdevices that can separate organic and unorganic garbage, thus it is still mixed upin one container. This condition needs a deeper attention in order to improve theexisting garbage transportation management. This research aims to improve the weakness of the current garbage transportationsystem. The SNI No. 19-2454-2002 was used as an approached method to solvethis problem. In order to determine appropriate tariffs that can cover theoperational cost of garbage transportation, the method of financial assessmentwas used namely Net Present value (NPV), Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR), andInternal Rate of Return (IRR).The garbage transportation system chosen for a compactor truck was fixedcontainer transportation mode and for an arm roll truck was empty containertranportation mode. The number of vehicle required to carry out garbagetransportation in Amlapura was 4 compactor trucks for organic garbages, 3compactor trucks for unorganic garbages, and a unit of arm roll truck for organicand inorganic garbages. The reguired time for picking garbage was about sixhours per day. The numbers of TPS needed in Amlapura were 213 bin containerswith capacity of 0.36 m3 for organic TPS and 137 units for the unorganic. It wasalso required 5 units of organic TPS and 3 units of the unorganic that usingcontainers with capacity of 4 m3. It was assumed that this investment would befinanced by 100% of bank loan. The result of this study shows that thisinvestment will be reliable if the applied tarrif is Rp.15.000/family/month forhousehold, Rp.25.000/room/month for hotel, Rp.5000/seat/month for restaurant,Rp.30.000/unit/month for shop, Rp.20.000/unit/month for school and office, Rp.30.000/seller/month for market trader, Rp. 30.000/month for small scale industryand Rp. 40.000/month for middle scale industry."
