## Abstract:
"Chalk or limestone is frequently used for backfill materials and forstabilizing foundation layers of highway because of it’s good support in bearingcapacity. However it is known that carbonate acid (H2CO3), which is soluble in theground water, can dissolve chalks or limestone chemically. The natural acidenvironment is able to decrease the strength (support capability) of backfill andfoundation layer.This study is conducted to determine the effect of carbonate acid on aggregatecollision strength value of limestone (aggregate impact value or AIV). The AIVvalue is one of the indicators used in measuring the strength of aggregate. The AIVindicates that the aggregate was not too strong to receive loads from the burden ofvehicle’s wheel or other load while it is being compacted. The tests on limestonestrength were conducted after soaking the limestone into carbonate acid solution ina series of acid concentration as follows: 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 parts per million. The soaking process of each solution was carried out for 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30days long. The basic design used was a Factorial Complete Random Design, whichstudied matters such as the variation of carbonate acid concentration and thevariation of soaking time. Then the test results was analyzed using a StyleInvestigation Analysis, Least Significant Different test and Disperse DiagramThe test results show that the variation of concentration from 5 to 25 parts permillion does not significantly affect the strength of limestone aggregate impact, butthe time soaking has a real effect. There is an interaction between the variations ofcarbonate acid concentration solution with the time of soaking."
