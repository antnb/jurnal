## Abstract:
"In project construction world, many models of project planning havebeen intensively used, such as a Precedence Diagram Method (PDM). Schedulingon PDM considers dependency between activity and duration of each activity. Todeal with the limited resources, hence allocation and resources levelling need to beimplemented using Resource Scheduling Method. Activity scheduling priority isbased on activities with the minimum floating time. If some activities have thesame floating time, a problem arises in determining the priority of schedulingactivity. In the Ranked Position Weight Method (RPWM), allocation and resourceslevelling are based on positional weight of each activity. Positional weight isdetermined by adding the sum of duration of an activity with the sum of a totalduration of all following activities. The value of positional weight of an activityshows a degree of its importance in relation to other activities. The effects of theconstruction work condition on the project activity should be considered whenpreparing precedence logic (relationship of interdependency activities)."
