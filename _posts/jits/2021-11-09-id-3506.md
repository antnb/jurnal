## Abstract:
"Compressive strength and Modulus of elasticity of masonry are significantparameters when considering structural masonry design. This paper presents thosemasonry properties which were determined experimentally. Three types specimensmade of clay brick masonry and concrete block masonry were built. They were testedin compression until failure and conducted in accordance with the BS EN 1052-1:1999. Properties of structural units and the mortar were also determined. Resultsshow that the mean compressive strength of the mortar, clay brick units and concreteblock units are 4.2 N/mm2, 63.0 N/mm2 and 12.8 N/mm2 respectively. Thecharacteristic compressive strength of masonry made of clay brick is 11.2 N/mm2 andthat made of concrete block is 7.2 N/mm2. The failure of the masonry tested incompression was due to development of tensile cracks parallel to the axis of theloading. Modulus of elasticity of masonry was close to 1000 fk which is a formulagiven in Eurocode 6."
