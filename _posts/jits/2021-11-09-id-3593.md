## Abstract:
"Study on the determination of strain rate on CRS consolidation testmethod had been done on clay soil with different plasticity level. Similar study onorganic clay soil had also been carried out, in which the study was limited onorganic soil with low percentage of organic content that can be tested using CRS method, and the maximum organic content is 16 %. Up to date there is no study yetcarried out using CRS method for soil with high organic content (&gt; 16 %);therefore it has not yet known what is the strain rate range can be chosen.The problems arise if CRS method applied to organic clay soil are: what thecorrelation between strain rate magnitude and the organic content is; what thesuitable strain rate for soil with high organic content is; whether CRS method canbe used for all type of organic soil without modifying the available method.For this study, soil samples were prepared in laboratory by mixing organic soilwith caolinite with different percentage of organic content, i.e. 10 %, 20 %, 30 %,35 %, 40 %, and 45 %. The strain rate per minute chosen for the CRS consolidationtest were 0,04 %/minute; 0,02 %/minute; 0,008%/minute; 0,005 %/minute;0,002 %/minute. For obtaining correlation between organic content and strain rate,both CRS consolidation and conventional method were carried out.Test results and analyses show that the chosen strain rate and organic contentinfluence the test period, water void stress formed at the base of the samples (UB),the effective stress occurred, and the values of Cc and Cv. The final conclusion ofthis study is that when compared with the conventional consolidation test method,the CRS method gives reasonably a good correlation on strain rate:0.04 %/minutefor sample with 10 % organic content; 0,02 %/minute on sample with 20 % organiccontent; 0,008 %/minute on sample with 30 % and 35 % organic content0,005 %/minute on sample with 40 % organic content; and 0,002 %/minute onsample with 45 % organic content. The testing time on the same strain rateincreases when the soil organic content increases. It was also found that, at thesame organic content the testing time increases as the the strain rate decreases."
