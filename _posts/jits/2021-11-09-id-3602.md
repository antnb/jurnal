## Abstract:
"The increase of activities particularly shopping centers in BadungRegency, requires sufficient supply of parking facility. However, so far there is nostudy on parking characteristics and quantification of standard parking spacesdemand. The objectives of this study are to evaluate parking characteristics onshopping centers in Badung Regency and to analyse standard of parking spacesdemand. Data required are primary data which is obtained from survey on site toobtain parking characteristics and secondary data is obtained from the shoppingcenters management which is used to analyse standard parking space demand.Results of the study indicate that for light vehicle, parking index based on averageparking accumulation is 0,72, while for motor cycles it is 3,09. Relationship modelbetween average parking accumulation for light vehicle on working days isy = 0,0016x + 9,289 (R2 = 0,8786) and for motor cycle is y = 0,0032x + 123,69 (R2= 0,5776). Average parking accumulation required for the maximum floor area ofbuilding of 75.648 m2 is 178 vehicles/hour with 194 spaces and 434 motorcycles/hour with 1.209 spaces. For the minimum floor area of building of 5.000m2, average parking accumulation required is 19 vehicles/hour with 21 spaces and141 motor cycles/hour with 393 spaces."
