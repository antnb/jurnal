## Abstract:
"The port of crossing between Ketapang and Gilimanuk connecting ofJava and Bali Island represents very busy port after port of crossing betweenMerak and Bakauheni connecting of Java and Sumatra Island. Natural demandincreases rapidly by years whereas facilities (number of berth) and basic facilities(number of ferries) are unable to balance it. This research was conducted inSeptember 2008 at condition of normal operation by taking location at port ofKetapang. The objective of this research is to optimize in the event of problem ordamage at one part of the system. Collected data cover growth of demand,condition of facilities, dock headway and also schedule which have been specifiedby PT. ASDP. Method used is single line analysis. The result shows by usingtechnique of optimization when operation problem would possibly happen, thesystem still can give optimal service so that queue (lay time) passenger can beminimized."
