## Abstract:
"Estimation of duration and cost of a project are two classical problemsthat always arise in the real world construction project. In the current practice, thecost is analyzed separately from a planning by estimators. In fact, time and cost ofthe construction project depend on what kind of product to be constructed, how torealize it, when and where it has to be constructed. They have an intimateinterrelationship and can not be separated while analyzing them. When a planningof activities is changed, the project cost would change as well. The existing costmodel does not integrate this relation. The project cost is estimated based on theassumed rates of construction resources and gross quantity of works without takinginto account how the activities will be performed. This paper proposes a cost modelthat can integrate the planning and the construction direct cost based on the dailynecessary resources of the related planning. It presents also some examples of itsapplication. This model is very useful to simulate the real project direct cost froman estimated planning before executing the project. The accuracy of the resultdepends completely on the accuracy of estimated planning and the basicinformation corresponding to time and cost estimation of an elementary activity."
