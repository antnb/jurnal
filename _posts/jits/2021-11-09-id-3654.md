## Abstract:
"Badung Regency, especially South of Badung is the center of tourism inBali where development of shopping centers increases. The existence of theseshopping centers as one of commercial facilities has attracted trips which cause theincrease of traffic volume, degree of saturation, and conflict between through andlocal traffic. Therefore, a study on the amount of trips attracted to these shoppingcenters is required. The objectives of this study are to evaluate trips mode compositionand to model trip attraction to shopping centers. The primary data were obtainedfrom trip attraction survey whilst the secondary data were obtained from theadministration of the shopping centers (i.e. total area, floor area, parking area,number of employments, and number of supporting facilities available). The resultsof analyses on customer mode split indicated that the proportion of using motorbike was 58,43%, 41,37% light vehicle, 0,10% heavy vehicle and 0,10% unmotorisedvehicle. Multiple regression analyses indicated that independent variablesthat influence trip attraction on peak hour are total area (X1) and parking area(X2). For one day trips, only total area had a significant influence. Trip attractionmodel for morning peak hour, evening peak hour ad for one day trips are: Y11 =105,747 + 0,005 .X1 (R2 = 0,967); Y12 = 45,601 + 0,015 .X3 (R2 = 0,984); Y13 =3405,73 + 0,187. X1 (R2 = 0,920), respectively."
