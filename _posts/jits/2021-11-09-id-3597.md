## Abstract:
"Continuous efforts are needed in utilizing waste materials in buildingindustry. This investigation was intended to use waste materials, namely: steel slag,crushed glass and coal fly ash for producing Masonryblock, i.e. a masonry buildingblock bound with bitumen (asphalt). The binder used was bitumen of 50 pen. Thematerials were pre-heated at 160 °C for 3 hours before mixing and compactedusing static compactor at 8 MPa. The properties of the blocks evaluated werecompressive strength and creep. In order to minimize creep deformation, thesamples were heat cured at 160 °C for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Creep test was carriedout by loading the samples using a cantilever arm loading equipment with 1 MPastress until the creep strain stable. The strain was measured by means of a 50 mmDemec gauge. It was found that the Masonryblock compressive strengthcomparable to the concrete block commonly used in the United Kingdom (UK).The sample requires at least 48 hours curing in order to satisfy creep performancerequirement."
