## Abstract:
"Two things that always emerge in business activity, includingconstruction business, are either earning profit or suffering risk of loss, directly orindirectly. Many efforts have been done by contractors as the service provider, toavoid or to mitigate risk in order to achieve the effective result. One of these is byanalyzing risk in terms of the type of project contract that is comparing betweenLumpsum contract and Unit Price contract from the contractor view.The method used is Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Analysis process initiallystarted from collecting the problems and making the hierarchy structure. Thehierarchy consists of three levels, that are objective (level I), criterion (level II), andalternatif (level III). Based on the hierarchy then followed by composing a series ofquestionnaires. Data was collected from questionnaires that were distributed to 20respondents of contractors in Denpasar Regency. The data were then analyzed bycreating and comparing matrices, scaling priority weight of level II and III, andchecking the consistency as well.The analysis result shows that priority value of lump sum contract is 81,70% andthe value of unit price contract is 18,30%. It means that lump sum contract hashigher risk of loss compare to unit price contract."
