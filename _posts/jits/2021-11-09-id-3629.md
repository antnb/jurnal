## Abstract:
"Traffic congestions, traffic violations, and queuing problems inWestern Lombok Region were frequently occurred at the main intersection, inparticular at four legged intersection of Gerung. This is caused by ineffectiveoperation at the intersection e.g. the use of the area for parking and stopping ofpublic transport (angdes and cidomo). Therefore, it is required to evaluate thethe intersection performance and to propose the intersection management.Primary data collected includes geometric, environment condition and trafficdata. Performance analysis was conducted for the existing condition (unsignalisedintersection) and for the proposed new traffic signal. The analysiswas based on IHCM 1997 method. The analysis for existing condition showedthat the capacity of the intersection was 3,159 pcu/hour and the degree ofsaturation was 0.74. This indicated that traffic management is required toimprove the intersection performance such as redesigning geometric andapplying traffic signal"
