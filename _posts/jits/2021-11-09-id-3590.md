## Abstract:
"Column is one of important structural elements to ensure that thestructure will not suffer progressive collapse. In earthquake resistant design,column must have an adequate strength and ductility to provide ductile behavior todesipate earthquake forces on the structure. Strength and ductility of columnsdepend on many factors such as reinforcement arrangements. This analysis is doneto investigate the effect of longitudinal dan transversal reinforcement arrangementon strength and ductility of reinforced concrete columns. Two groups of 4 specimens each, total 8 column sections were analized both withand without considering concrete confinement. In this analysis, stress-strainconcrete model for unconfined concrete follows Honestaad Model (1951) and forconfined concrete model follows Razvi and Saatcioglu Model (1999). Stress-strainof reinforcement is assumed to be a bilinear relationship. In the analysis ofdisplacement ductility, the column height was taken of 3.5 meter behaving doublecurvature.Comparison of the results shows that for constant longitudinal reinforcement ratio(rl), arrangements of longitudinal bars distributed uniformly along the columnsides has no significant effect on strength and ductility of the column section bothfor unconfined and confined section analysis.Hoop configuration gives an increase in strength (Mn), curvature ductility (?j) anddisplacement ductility (?D) on average about 1.2%, 2.3% and 1.83% if they areanalyzed without considering confinement effects. However, the increase in thoseparameters is about 1.2%, 12%, 9.4% for strength (Mn), curvature ductility (?j) anddisplacement ductility (?D) if considering the effects of confinement.In general, the effect of hoop confinement on column section can increase incolumn strength and ductility on average of 0.25%, 158% and 98% respectively forstrength, curvature and displacement ductilities."
