## Abstract:
"Some researches have shown that critical phenomena on the use of FRPsheets as external reinforcement is de-bounding between the FRP sheet andconcrete. This research was done to investigate the effect of end anchorage onfailure behavior and flexural strength of reinforced concrete beam with additionalGFRP sheet.The test was done on reinforced concrete beam specimens with dimension of 100 x150 x 1100 mm on a simple support having a span length of 900 mm. Thespecimens were loaded using 2 point concentrated loads at 300 mm from thesupports. Three group specimens were made namely control beam withoutadditional GFRP sheets, beam with 2 layer GFRP sheets without end anchorage, beam with 2 layer GFRP sheets with end anchorage type U-shape straps, fastenersand steel bolts. Each group consists of 3 specimens. The data observed during thetest are cracking loads, crack patterns, crack widths, ultimate load capacities,deflections and failure modes.Test results show that end anchorage changes starting point of de-boundingmode failure of the GFRP sheets which is from the point of cut-off to the middlespan of the beams. The addition of end anchorages can increase the ultimateflexural capacity of the beam with 2 layer GFRP sheet about 18.628%, 5.555% and10.131% respectively for end anchorage of fastener, U-shape straps and steel bolts.When it is compared to the capacity of control beam, the ultimate flexural capacityof the beams with end anchorage is higher about 31.373%, 18.3% and 22.876% forend anchorage of fastener, U-shape straps and steel bolts, respectively."
