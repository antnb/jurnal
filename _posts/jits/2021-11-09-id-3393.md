## Abstract:
"The safety and comfortable of the user of road is determined by quality ofits surface course which can be stated by the index value of its surface. The use of HotRolled Sheet (HRS) as a surface course is very famous in Indonesia. So it is a need toimprove its quality. Because of the lack of its filler at a natural aggregation and thelimit of production of stone ash from the stone crusher, it is required an endeavour tofind out the alternative filler which can replace the stone ash functions in the HotRolled Sheet mixture. For this reason, it will be tried to use the ash of limestone and“Portland” cement as alternative filler. A research has been undertaken in a laboratoryby making a specimen as a sample and treatment to different fillers, a various asphaltquantity and aggregation of gradation which fulfill the specification from Bina Marga.The result shows that by different fillers will make a different characteristic ofmixture, but on certain asphalt quantity the three treatments that is filler of stone ash,ash of limestone and “Portland” cement, still in line with the specification from BinaMarga."
