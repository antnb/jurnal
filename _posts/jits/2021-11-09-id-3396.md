## Abstract:
"Three main objective in the constructing construction project thereare cost, time and quality. Cost and time have great relationship and depending oncethan the other. Some time in the field we founded nonconform between the duration ofcompletion in the contract with the realization. On the case studi of PembangunanStadion Olah Raga Buruan in Kecamatan Blahbatuh, Gianyar, the owner need thatproject be completed earlier than the agreement completion. The influence ofacceleration completion project with the project cost need to study.In this case the CPM (Critical Path Method) be used with compressed the duration ofactivities on the critical path and do time cost trade off analysis. The project costmeans is the total cost project. The total project cost are direct cost (material, workersand equipment) and indirect cost (the other direct cost).The outcome of analysis be founded that accelerate (crash) maximum 65 days done, sothe earliest completion by 265 days without total project cost added. The projectcompletion optimum be founded too, with project duration 316 days and project totalcost minimum amount Rp. 13.358.425.131,28, that’s below 0.55 % than project cost in contract. This phenomenon show that accelerate the duration completion project notalways be increasing the total project cost, because the duration of completion projectin the contract probably does not the optimum duration of completion."
