## Abstract:
"This paper presents a determination of compressive strength and waterabsorption of solid concrete block. The research objective was to determine theideal mix composition of the concrete block where Lapindo silt was used as acement substitution. Five types of mixes were made where Type A, B, C, D and Ewas (100% PC; 0% LS), (90% PC; 10% LS), (80% PC; 20% LS), (70% PC; 30%LS), and (60% PC; 40% LS) respectively. The weight ratio between Portlandcement and sand was 1:8 with a water cement ratio of 0.4. The cement used in thisresearch was Gresik Portland cement and the specimens were tested in the age of28 days. The water absorption test results showed that the use of 24.56% ofLapindo silt as a cement substitution optimally decreased the water absorption upto 18.21% and gave a compressive strength of 71.5 kg/cm2 that is qualified asB1.This was caused by the block contained SiO2 work as a filler and CaO as a bindof the materials. The small water absorption value could also increase the durabilityof solid concrete block. The compressive strength and water absorption of the solidconcrete block with 7,25% of Lapindo silt was 100,1 kg/cm2 (qualified as B2) and20,72% respectively."
