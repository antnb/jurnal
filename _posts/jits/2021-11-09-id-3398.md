## Abstract:
"A reinforced concrete structure can guarantee its safety by giving strengthcapacity or design strength more than any combination of working load effect. Designstrength can be obtained by multiplying normal strength with reduction value of fstrength less than one and nominal load is multiplied with the load factor with the valuemore than one. It can be written as factored resistance ³ effect of factored loads.Resistance factor can be expressed in some ways. Such as ACI Building Code wasexpressed as fRn ³ D Dn + L Ln, where f was resistance factor and D, and L wereload factor for dead load and live load. Meanwhile CEB explained about resistancefactors with reduction factor directly to its material, fc`/c and fy/s where c and s were partial material of safety factor or under strength material factors for concrete and steel.Herewith result from concrete material variability, the variety coefficient compressionstrength of concrete ( Wfc) had great influence to the reduction factor both globalreduction factor from ACI and material partial reduction factor from CEB. The increaseof load ratio (L/D) would add space between factor of dead load (D) and live load (L)were wider. With the increase of the value index gave the increase of safety condition.The result of the study was obtained that the influence of small dimension was to theglobal reduction factor and material partial reduction factor. After comparing the resultsobtained from the calculation method using global reduction factor (ACI) with materialpartial reduction factor (CEB), it could be drawn a conclusion that for beam and coloumusing global reduction factor, its capacity to hold dead load was more than 13 % thanmaterial partial reduction factor."
