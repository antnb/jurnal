## Abstract:
"It is known that the development of physical medium especially housingproblem is needed by everybody and has already developed by the developerseither in town or outside town. The houses vary started from their types, technicalspecification designs which are intended to be reachable by the customer.Eventhough the amenities offered by the developer such as paying installments, inreality there are still public civil servants (PNS) and private sector officers are notyet able to buy / to own a house by themselves caused by many reasons.In this research the selection of respondent was conducted using purposivesampling method. It is a research that base on the ability, knowledge and also certain consideration in selecting the respondents who are believed can make theirchoices and are able to answer the questioner promptly according to the relatedtopic. The analyses were carried out using the theory of linear probability modelmethod (LPM) and if the probable value is outside the definition (0 and 1) hence itwill be overcame by using a logistic regression model.The analysis results showed that the sum of the family members have a signifanteffect to the ownership of the house with a significant level of 5%. The coefficientof logistic regression was equal to 1.2142105 meaning that if family membersincrease one more hence the probability of the ownership of the house will increaseby 0.771043 (77.10 %). The value -2log likelihood equal to 27.953 was bigger thanthat of X2 table (7.815). This means that simultaneously the three independentvariables (earnings, work, and total of family member) have an effect towarddependent variable (ownership of house)."
