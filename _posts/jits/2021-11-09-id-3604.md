## Abstract:
"Ellips Errors were constructed to analyse pedestrian accidentsconcentrations in Newcastle, England. More specifically, Ellips Errors were used toanalyse both spatial and temporal patterns of pedestrian accidents. Having observedthese patterns, cyclic pedestrian accidents would be able to be identified. The studyresults showed that high accident concentration occurred in the Newcastle citycentre area. These were indicated with both centroids and distributions (shown asellips area) of pedestrian accidents. Top priority on pedestrian accidents reduction,therefore, should be paid more on the city centre area. The best result for using thisEllips Error method in Indonesia will be achieved through integrated road accidentsrecording system by means of Global Positioning System (GPS) and GeographicInformation System (GIS). Geographic position of road accidents and detailedmaps of the urban area, i.e. 1:1000 on scale, are required for this Ellips Errormethod."
