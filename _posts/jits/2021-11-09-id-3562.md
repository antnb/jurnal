## Abstract:
"Soil stabilization by adding limestone as admixture, was one of the mostpopular methods of chemical stabilization in Indonesia. However, with thedevelopment of soil stabilization method, stabilization using limestone has startedto become unfeasible due to the increase of limestone price. Cheaper methods ofchemical stabilization should be sought after. This alternative is apparent in theuse of powdered marble, a waste from marble product processing factories whichis relatively very cheap, and a new product called Stabilia as the only made-in Indonesia product of chemical stabilizer for soil with a price less than a third ofthat of the similar imported products.Research on the effectiveness of both powdered marble and Stabila as soilstabilizers is very limited. Therefore, in this study both of materials were tested onclay soil from Pejaten, Tabanan, in order to identify the changes of soil plasticity,the increase of the soil strength, the changes of soil swelling when the soil wassubmerged under water, the thickness of soil layer affected by water as a functionof the submersion time, the effect of soil initial water content when beingcompacted toward its swelling and its compressive strength, and the optimummaterial. The specimens were made by adding powdered marble that ranges from3% to 12% and the Stabilia content ranges form 0,3% to 3,0% of the total soilweight.From the test it was obtained that both materials caused reduction of soil swellingand increase of soil strength. In general, admixture with Stabilia presented betterresults in terms of free swelling and compressive strength of the samples.Apparently, Stabilia gave the performance almost similar to limestonestabilization. This study also gives a recommendation on the thickness of the soillayer to be stabilized and the optimum admixture content. It is also suggested thatevaluation of the performance of stabilizing agent should not be based on thechanges of soil plasticity alone, but it has to be determined according to theamount of allowable swelling, so that after the soil expands it is still able tosupport the load of foundation or vehicle tires. The influence of water submersionon the surface of the soil sample is merely felt at the relatively thin layer on the topof the sample."
