## Abstract:
"This study examines regencial road handling priority using FAHP a-cutbased and TOPSIS methods using Badung regency in Bali province as the casestudy area. The study is restricted to regencial roads under severe conditions.Adoption of these FAHP a-cut based and TOPSIS methods allow the researcher tohave estimation regarding the overall road handling priority considering thedecision makers’s attitude from optimistic to pessimistic situations and decisionmakers’s degree of confidence from under the most uncertain to certaincomparisons. Meanwhile, the previous study has analysed the same case study areausing FAHP extent analysis and TOPSIS methods with no consideration ondecision makers’s attitude and confidence. This study concluded that road handlingdetermination using FAHP a cut based and TOPSIS methods, considering bothpessimistic and moderate situations and highly optimistics situation with uncertainconditions of the decision makers, produced similar top prioty as it used FAHPextent analysis and TOPSIS methods."
