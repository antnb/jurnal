## Abstract:
"The Serangan-Tanjung Benoa Bridge is designed as a reinforced concretearch bridge as it usually built on hard soils, so it can be modelled as a fixed arch.However, the brigde was design on soft soil (N &lt; 15) with hard soil (N &gt; 50), 30 mbelow. Therefore, it is necessary to study the behavior of arch structure consideringsoil-structures interaction, due to vertical and lateral loads.Two models were made in order to model the soil-structure interaction: Model 1, thelateral soil supports is modelled as spring; Model 2, soil and foundation are modelledas solid element. Model 3, fixed arch was modelled without foundation. While modelling the soil as spring and solid, pile groups were asssumed as caisson and weremodelled as solid, and the elastic modulus of soil between piles is equal to the elasticmodulus of pile and its values were varieted and compared to the fixed model.Modulus of base soil lateral reaction, kh is modeled as spring with E of 28 N anduniformly distributed on caisson surface area behind the load. The finite elementmethod was made in 3D using SAP2000 program with static and time history analysisfor vertical and earthquake load, respectively.Soil modelled as spring and solid element in soil-structure interaction showcompatible, in which the deformation and internal forces varied by less than 2%. Themaximum deflection occurred on the peak of arch due to dead load of 191.4 mm, or37.87% smaller than the maximum deflection of the model including soil-structureinteraction. Moreover, fixed arch model has natural period of 2.37 second, which is0.39 second shorter than that including soil-structure interaction. With E greater than9000 MPa (sandstone type) the three models give deformation and internal forces itcompatible values with differences less than 2.2%."
