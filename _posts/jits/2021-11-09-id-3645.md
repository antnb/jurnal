## Abstract:
"In the SNI 03-1726-2002 Standard Clause 4.3.5 it is stated that “When astructural system parallel to the direction of nominal earthquake load, consists ofsome sub-structural systems, the representative reduction factor (Rr) of theearthquake load for this structure in the direction of the earthquake load can becalculated as an average of weighting values with each sub-structural system baseshear as its weighting factors”. With the representative reduction factor (Rr), thebase shear acting on the structure does not consider the weakest sub-system whichreaches its yielding capacity first, whereas base on stiffness concept, sub-systemwith a different ductility will resist a different base shear. In order to investigatedynamic behavior of a structure due to this both earthquake loading condition,analysis was done on a reinforced concrete structure of a regular building consistedof structural sub-systems of shear walls and frames which have each differentductility. This both loading conditions are the earthquake with reduction factor ofRr and Rs.Dynamic behavior of the structure is obtained from the results of modeling andanalysis of the structure using finite element software (SAP 2000). The calculationwas done in two stages in which the first stage, the structure was designed to resistboth gravity load and earthquake load. In the design process, earthquake load wastreated as static equivalent earthquake load with a reduction factor calculatedaccording to SNI 03-1726-2002 requirements. The second stage, the structure thathas been designed, its dynamic behavior was evaluated using nonlinear staticpushover analysis including period, base shear, horizontal drift, stiffness, dampingand other dynamic properties of the structures.The results of analysis show that dynamic behaviors of the structure subjected toearthquake load with representative reduction factor (Rr) differ from those of theearthquake load with reduction factor each sub-system (Rs). For earthquake loadwith reduction factor Rs, the actual ductility factor, actual earthquake reductionfactor, effective period of the structure are bigger than those of the structure withreduction factor Rr. However, it has smaller base shear, less number of plastichinges and smaller effective damping."
