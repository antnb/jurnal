## Abstract:
"Joint laboratory building is to be built at Udayana University in Denpasar campus. It is important to consider the potential of the earthquake in the region. Based on SNI - 03-1726-2002, Denpasar is located in seismic zone 5 (regions with strong seismic risk). The purpose of this study is to plan the structure of earthquake-resistant reinforced concrete buildings including the calculation and design plan based on SNI 03-2847-2002 and SNI 03-1726-2002 using the Special Moment Resisting Frame (SMRF). The building has a floor plan size of 61.6 m x 41.8 m, with 4 floors structure and 14.4 m high. The structure planned resulted a 120 mm thick slab with reinforcement of Ø12 mm and the distance between the foundation and reinforcement on the field is of 150 mm , while in the staging area used for the reinforcement is of Ø12 - 300 mm. Stairs calculation is obtained with a reinforcement with D12 – 150 and Ø10 - 200 mm . Secondary beam 25/35 used a reinforcement with 4D13 and Ø10-50 mm . For primary beam 35/60 used 4 D16 main reinforcement , and reinforcement Ø10-150 mm on the hoops and torsion . In the column used 50/50 with the main reinforcement 12D19 mm and Ø10-120 mm. Pile foundations are used with the dimensions of 25/25 and a depth of 6 m ."
