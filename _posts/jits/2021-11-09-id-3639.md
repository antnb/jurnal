## Abstract:
"A study was carried out to analyse the daily solid waste generation in thedistrict of Kuta and to determine the number of trips required transporting thewaste to the final disposal site (TPA) in Suwung for the year of 2009, and itsestimation until 2015. Data required for the study was collected from on-sitesurveys and other relevant institutions. The study analysis was based on methodsderived from the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) and US EnvironmentalProtection Agency.The study shows that the district of Kuta generated 272.89 m3 solid waste per dayin 2009. The solid waste transportation to the final disposal site (TPA) in Suwungis carried out using stationary container system/SCS and hauled containersystem/HCS. By maximizing the use of the existing solid waste collection trucksowned by DKP Badung Pangkalan Kuta, i.e. the municipal waste managementinstitution for the Kuta District, the transportation to the TPA requires 34 trips/dayof SCS, supplemented by 2 and 3 trips/day of HCS for container sites at Jl. PuriGerenceng, Tuban and Pasar Kuta Unit II respectively. In case no 3R-policy forsolid waste management is adopted, the solid waste generation in 2015 is predictedto be 501.89 m3/day. Considering that no more solid waste container location isprovided, it would be necessary to increase the number of trips using SCS methodto 67 trips/day."
