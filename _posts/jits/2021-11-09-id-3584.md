## Abstract:
"In the real construction world, resources for construction activitiesare usually limited. The critical path method (CPM) that has beenintensively used in construction industry for planning and controlling ofconstruction, is not feasible for this problem because of the unlimitedresources assumption. To deal with the limited resources, constructionplanner must include resources allocation in order to find out an applicableproject planning. The activity’s duration and their sequences may need to beadjusted by considering the available resources at the considered time. Thispaper presents a process model for project planning using the geneticalgorithm searching technique to solve the multicriteria problem inconstruction planning in order to find out an optimal construction projectplanning. The genetic algorithm can solve the combinatorial problems ofproject planning and give an integrated planning solution, such as, projectplanning, resources levelling, smoothing by considering multi-criteria andmulti-constraints for project planning."
