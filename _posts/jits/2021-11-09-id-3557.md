## Abstract:
"The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship betweencoefficient permeability of concrete and volume of granular styrofoam added into aconcrete mix. The styrofoam added to concrete is in order to have concrete with asmaller density.The concrete was mixed using Portland cement type I, sand from Karangasemwhich was proportioned to meet zone 2 of gradation limit, gravels from the samesource as sands which was also proportioned to meet gradation limit withmaximum diameter of 25 mm according to ASTM C 33-74 and round granularstyrofoam with diameter ranges from 3 mm to 10 mm having density of 22,89kg/m3. Concrete mix was proportioned according to the ingrediens weight that is1:2:3, respectively for cement, sand and gravels with water cement ratio of 0.5.Variation of the styrofoam added into the concrete mix is 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and40% of total mix volume. The specimens used in this experiment is standardconcrete cylinders with diameter of 150 mm and 300 mm in height. The specimenwas tested at 28 days of age.The experimental results show that the coefficient of concrete permeability increaseswith increasing additional granular styrofoam into the concrete mix. The coeficientof permeability is 2,274x10-9 cm/dt; 4,170x10-9 cm/dt; 7,917x10-9 cm/dt;17,839x10-9 cm/dt; and 42,135x10-9 cm/dt for addition of styrofoam 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively. The relationship between the coeficient of permeabilityand percentage of styrofoam added into the concrete follows a nonlinearregresión curve."
