This research aims to analyze the implementation of Education for All (EFA) programs by Lao PDR government. The concept of human security is able to explain the importance of education through the process of how the government captures this as a threat to the individual and the responsibility to protect (RTPR) from Lao PDR government. Since the collaboration with UNESCO, the Lao PDR government has finally directed its national policy to be focused on education This research uses descriptive qualitative method using official documents issued by Lao PDR government and UNESCO data.
