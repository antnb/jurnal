However, the international situation surrounding Malaysia has also give an impression that Chinese policies utilize BRI’s initiative to benefit its own interest rather than Malaysia interests including the South China Sea issue.

This research utilizes qualitative methods with secondary sources which then analyzed using the concept of National Interest and China’s Grand Strategy, the data were collected from books, journals, websites, etc. Keywords:Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), National Interest, Grand Strategy"
