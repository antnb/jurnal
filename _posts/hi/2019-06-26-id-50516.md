This study aims to analyze how significance the United States in WTOrelated to trade disputes with China in the case of broiler chicken exports in 2010-2014. The concept used in this study refers to the concept of International Organizations by Clive Archer (2001) and the concept of Power in International Organizations by Barkin (2006). Keywords:Dumping, Dispute Settlement Body, United States, China."
