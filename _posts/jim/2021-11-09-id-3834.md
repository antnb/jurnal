## Abstract:
"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is related to the increased of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thisstudy is aiming to identify the prevalence of CKD based on demographical distribution in Bali. A communitybased study has been conducted in Bali, 1) height region among indigenous community in a village at northernpart of Bali island using cluster random samples.; 2) in urban area at Denpasar city using stratified randomsampling and 3) in isolated coastal area in Nusa Ceningan island using cluster random sampling. The glomerularfiltration rate was calculated by Cockroft-Gault (C-G) formula and abbriviated Modification of Diet in RenalDisease ringkas with 4 variables (MDRD-4). The results of GFR using both calculation were compared. CKDwas defined based on KDOQI classification, namely GFR less than 60 ml/mnt. During the study 826 sampleswere collected consisted of 219 from height region (males/females 118/101, aged 48±15 years, BW 48.9±10.4kg, creatinine 0.97±0.64 mg/dL), 302 from urban area (males/females 137/165, aged 43±16 years, BW56.1±12.1 kg, creatinine 0.81±0/.19 mg/dL) and 305 isolated coastal area (males/females 150/155, aged 42±16years, BW 53.5±10.3 kg, creatinine 1.00±0.18 mg/dL). Using C-G, mean prevalence of CKD was 56.0%(95%CI 51.2-60.7%) consisted of 69.9% (95%CI 60.6-77.9%) in height region, 61.9% (95%CI54.5-68.8%) inurban and 42.3% (95%CI 33.7-51.4%) in isolated coastal area. Using 4-MDRD formula, mean prevalence ofCKD was 6.0% ( 95%CI 1.4-18.2%) consisted of 4.8% (95%CI 0.00-31.2%) in height region, 2,6% (95%CI50.3-43.1%) in urban and 9.8% (95%CI 2.5-27.4%) in isolated coastal area. In conclusion, there is a significantdifference of CKD prevalence in Bali if calculated by C-G compared with MDRD-4. Prevalence of CKD in Baliwith MDRD-4 (6.0%) is similar to those in other countries such as USA (4.2%) and Thailand (8.8%). Whetherthe calculation of GFR using MDRD-4 is more accurate than C-G in this setting, needs further study."
