## Abstract:
"Prevalence of knee Osteoarthritis (OA) in the community is quite high. Diagnosis and assessment of severity of knee OAbased on X-ray examination is not so sensitive yet. Various attempts have been made to nd markers of cartilage damage.One potential marker is Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP). Based on animal studies, the more severity damageof joint cartilage, the more COMP is released. Based on this, researchers want to know whether there is a correlationbetween the severities of knee OA with serum concentration of COMP in human.This study is a cross sectional analyticstudy, whose performed in Outpatient clinic RSUP Sanglah Denpasar. The diagnosis of knee OA based on ACR criteriaand the degree of knee OA severity is determined based on the Kellgren and Lawrance criteria. COMP patients arechecked by using ELISA method. The correlation between the severities of knee OA and serum COMP was analyzed bySpearman correlation test. Level of statistical signicance used was p &lt; 0.05. Sixty-six patients who meet the inclusioncriteria are examined, male was 28 (42.4%), women was 38 (57.6%). The mean age is 63.9 ± 7.0 years. The severity ofknee OA are: 4.5% for grade one, 35.8% grade two, 38.8% grade three and 20.9% at grade 4. The mean serum COMPconcentration is 1084.0 ng/ml. There is a trend of increasingly grade of severity of knee OA, the higher the concentrationof serum COMP, but not statistically signicant (r = 0.127, p = 0.31). In conclusion, there is no positif correlation thatstatistically signicant between severity of knee OA and serum COMP concentration."
