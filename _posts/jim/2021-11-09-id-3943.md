## Abstract:
"Falls are a major health problem for elderly. Apart from the direct injuries resulting from falls, other long-term consequencesmay include disability, fear of falling, and loss of independence, which can have serious effects on people?s health and qualityof life. These risk factors are categorized into two distinct groups: intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Psychological factors, morecommonly referred to the ?fear of falling syndrome?, have been linked to signi! cant reductions of daily activities in fallersresulting in a loss of independence. The Activities-Speci! c Balance Con! dence (ABC) scale was used to measure con! dence incarrying out speci! c activities without falling or becoming unsteady. We conduct an analytic cross-sectional study to determineassociation between ABC scale with age and falls in elderly. Fifty two elderly outpatient, age over 60 years at Geriatric ClinicSanglah Hospital Denpasar on January 2010 recruited for this study. All subjects were asked questionnaire of ABC scale andhistory of falls. Health status was taken from physical examination and medical records. Data were analyzed using SPSSsoftware 17 version.There were 52 elderly outpatient consisted of 26 (50%) men, 26 (50%) women, age range 61 ? 87 years, mean 70.6 ±6.5 years, and 17.3% of them have history of falls. Total ABC scale mean were signi! cantly difference between women andmen (81.2 ± 14.1 vs 90 ± 12.8 p &lt; 0.05); OA and without OA (80.5 ± 18.1 vs 88.6 ± 10.3 p &lt; 0.05); and between faller and nonfaller(73.5 ± 13.6 vs 88.2 ± 12.9 p = 0.01). There was no signi! cant correlation between ABC scale and age. The ABC scalewith cut off 82.9 has signi! cantly association with falls p = 0.01; prevalence ratio = 7.0 95%CI 1.6 ? 49.8; 74.4% sensitivity,78% speci! city. As a conclusion we found lower total ABC scale has signi! cantly association with falls in elderly and has goodsensitivity and speci! city on scale below 82.9%."
