## Abstract:
"Elevated serum uric acid concentrations are commonly seen in association with individual cardiovascular risk factorsuch as hypertriglyseridemia, hypertension, obesity, and hyperglycemia, a cluster that, when found together in the same person,characterizes the so-called metabolic syndrome. The original conceptualization of this syndrome was on the basis of resistance tothe actions of insulin. The reduction of endothelial nitric oxide bioavailability and the production of reactive oxygen species byuric acid may be the mechanism for insulin resistance. Otherwise insulin has a physiological action on renal tubules by stimulatingreabsorption of sodium and urate, resulting an increase in serum uric acid levels. In this condition, HOMA-IR was the modelwhich is a convenient means of evaluating insulin resistance.To know the association between serum uric acid concentration and insulin resistance, a cross sectional analytic studywas conducted on Balinese in Tenganan region between Desember 2007 and January 2008. The study involved 80 participantsage of 18-65 years old, agree to participate by informed consent. Serum concentration of insulin was measured by immunoassaymethod, plasma glucosa, serum uric acid, HDL-cholesterol, trigycerides, serum creatinin, were determined by enzymatic procedureafter overnight fast. Descriptive statistic analysis on numeric data presented as mean ± SD, nominal and ordinal data inproportion. Inferential statistic analysis with bivariate KendallÕs tau correlation and simple logistic regression was performed andmultiple logistic regression was used to know the independency of its association.Of 80 eligible samples, 39 (49%) men, and 41 (51%) women, mean age was 41.73 ± 12.41 yo, mean of waist circumferencewas 77.99 ± 10.91 cm, mean of serum uric acid concentration was 5.49 ± 1.38 mg/dL, mean of plasma glucosa was 92.04± 8.79 mg/dL, median of insulin was 2.70 (2.00 Ð 17.90) mIU/mL, median of HOMA-IR was 0.685 (0.38-4.10), mean of HDLcholesterol was 59.19 ± 14.01 mg/dL, and median of triglycerides was 122.50 (48 Ð 369) mg/dL. In univariate analysis, theinsulin resistance were positively correlated with serum uric acid, waist circumference, and triglycerides (r= 0.234; P = 0.003),(r = 0.269; P = 0.001), and (r = 0.153; P = 0.046) respectively and negatively with HDL cholesterol (r = -0.297; P = 0.009). Inmultivariate analysis with multiple logistic regression both the 2nd tertile of uric acid (4,7 Ð 6,6 mg/dL) and waist circumferencewere independently associated with the insulin resistance (PR 3.97; IK 95% : 1.273 Ð 12.386; P = 0.018), and (PR 5.79; IK 95%: 1.417 Ð 23.650; P = 0.014) respectively. Conclusion: There is association between serum uric acid concentration and insulinresistance, and both the 2nd tertile of uric acid and waist circumference are independently and significantly associated with insulinresistance."
