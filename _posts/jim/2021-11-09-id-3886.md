## Abstract:
"Osteoporosis occurs due to the increase of active osteoclastic bone resorption activity. This condition favors for bonemass decreased. The examination of Crosslink Telopeptida C-Terminal (CTx)serum concentration is a good indicator to determineosteoclastic bone resorption activity. The finding of that biochemical substance in serum indicates that there is increase ofosteoclast cell activity. The aim of the study was to prove that in estrogen deficient post-menopausal women, the CTxwas higherin the osteoporosis compared than the non-osteoporosis. The study was an analytic-observational study in case-control design,which was done at Sanglah General Hospital, Denpasar. The sample size was 41 case subjects (osteoporosis) and 41 controlsubjects (non-osteoporosis) using paired case-control sample size formula. The t-paired test result were: CTx serum concentrationwas higher significantly in case compared than control (0.60 ± 0.22ng/mL vs 0.46 ± 0.16ng/mL; p = 0.004). Therefore fromthe study we may conclude that: (1) CTx was higher in the osteoporosis compared than the non-osteoporosis in estrogen deficientpost-menopausal women. (2) Osteoclastic bone resoprtion activity was higher in the osteoporosis compared than the non-osteoporosisin estrogen deficient post-menopausal women"
