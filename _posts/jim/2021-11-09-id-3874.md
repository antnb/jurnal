## Abstract:
"The uses of adjuvan imunotherapy has attract the attention tuberculosis treatment, because of the increasing patientpersentage in antituberculosis agent. Propolis is bee glue, contain of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) that assumeimmunomodulator activities. The aim of this study were to assess the role of propolis to interleukin 12 secretion in macrophagesculture from pulmonary tuberculosis patient that infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M tb). This study was true experimentalusing post test only control group design, with sampel from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of lung tuberculosispatient that divided into 3 groups within 6 replication. Group I as control group without M tb infection and propolis intervention;group II treatment group with M tb infection only; and group III treatment with M tb infection and propolis intervention.Interleukin 12 secretion were measured 48 hours post M.tb infection. Result showed that means of interleukin 12 secretion atthese groups are 11 pg/ml; 23.33 pg/ml; 37 pg/ml in which intervention of propolis 10 mg/ml before M tb infection could increaseinterleukin 12 consentration significanly (p&lt; 0.05) compared with control group and group with infection of M tb only. Weconclude that propolis could increases macrophages activities with in increase secretion of interleukin 12."
