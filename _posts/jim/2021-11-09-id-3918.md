## Abstract:
"Anthropometric measurements are part of the nutritional assessment which is an important component of health care.Measuring the individual!s stature with accuracy is very important because it is a basis for estimating basal energy expenditureand consequent nutrient needs and to calculate indices of nutrient status. However, common methods of nutritional anthropometricassessment are not entirely satisfactory for all elderly persons. Certain measurements such as stature may be difÞ cult to obtainbecause of postural changes, thinning of the disks of the spinal column, and diminution in the height of the vertebrae, all of whichare associated with aging.This study conducted to investigate the correlation between thoracic hyperkyposis with the difference of height calculatedwith WHO formula and actual height measurements in elderly patients among geriatric outpatient clinic, Sanglah hospital. Thisis a descriptive study at August 2008. Height was calculated with WHO formula. For men 59.01 + (2.08 x knee height) and forwomen 75 + (1.91 X knee height) - (0.17 X age) and compared with actual height measurements. Data analyzed with analyticdescriptive Spearman!s correlation.There were 91 elderly patients included, male 38 (41.8%), female 53 (58.2%). Mean of age was 70.61 years ± 5.75 SD,actual height measurements was 155.30 cm ± 9.37 SD, height calculated with formula was 160.35 cm ± 8.59 SD, knee heightwas 49.60 ± 3.39 SD, thoracic hyperkiposis was -17.210 ± -11.7 SD and the difference between height formula and actual heightmeasurements was 4.99 cm ± 5.84 SD.There were no correlation between thoracic hyperkyposis and the difference of heightcalculated with WHO formula and actual height measurement with r = 0.001, p = 0.993. There were no correlations betweenbetween thoracic hyperkyposis with the difference of height calculated with speciÞ c formula and actual height measurements inelderly patients among geriatric outpatient clinic, sanglah hospital"
