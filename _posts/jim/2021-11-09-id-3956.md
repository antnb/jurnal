## Abstract:
"Hyperferitinemia in chronic kidney disease patients with regular hemodyalisis may caused by repeated transfusion,excessive iron supplementations, and also inß ammation. Increasing of serum feritin level doesn!t depend on iron reservecapacity. Hemodialysis patients with no supplementations may lead to several antioxidant components deÞ ciency. Qualitative andquantitative of vitamin C deÞ ciency may also occur, thus administration 1 " 1.5 gram/week or 300 mg of vitamin C parenterallyevery dialysis session was recommended in order to compensate subclinical deÞ ciency.This study determine whether administration of vitamin C (500 mg, in NaCl 0.9%, every session of hemodialysis in 8weeks) can decrease serum feritin level in chronic kidney disease patients with regular hemodialysis. Randomized clinical trial,single-blind of 38 chronic kidney disease patients with regular hemodialysis was recruited based on inclusion and exclusioncriteria. Randomization in group with treatment was done with permuted block randomization. Mean of serum feritin before andafter treatment in every group was compared and analysed with Man-Whitney U test. SigniÞ cancy level () was with p less than0.05 (p &lt; 0.05).The result of median and mean for decreasing of serum feritin in group with treatment of 500 mg, vitamin C is 0.00(-227.00 " 218.00) and 77.85 ± 383.25, respectively. While the result of median and mean for decreasing of serum feritincontrol group is 32.00 (-14.00 " 108.00) and 65.85 ± 209.6, respectively. On the analysis indicates median of serum feritinin group with treatment of vitamin C had less 32 points depends with control group (p = 0.84), Thus, there was no signiÞ cantdifference (p &gt; 0.05) between two groups. From Anova analysis for gender, there was signiÞ cant effect in decreasing of serumferitin level (p &lt; 0.05).There was no decreasing of serum feritin level after administration of 500 mg, vitamin C in chronic kidney diseasepatients with regular hemodialysis, and sex had signiÞ cant effect in alteration of serum feritin level."
