## Abstract:
"Diarrhea is defined as a change in bowel habit, with an increase in stool frequency or fluidity or both, more than 3 timesdaily or stool weight &gt; 200 g/day. Acute diarrhoe if it is less than 2 weeks of duration, persistent if between 2-4 weeks in duration,and Chronic if it is more than 4 weeks in duration. Diarhoea is a common problem around the world. Chronic diarrhea morecompleksabout diagnosis and treatment than acute one. The pathophysiiological mechanisms chronic diarhoea divided into major grouposmotic, secretory and imflamtory. A carefull history will often suggest the diagnosis and direct investigations. Physical examinationmore usefull to measure the severity of diarhoe rather than suggest the cause of chronic diarhoea. Iinitial investigation includeblood test, serology for celiac ds, stool examinations. Small intestinal and colon ds need for enteroscopy, capsul endoscopy,sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, many test for non invasive for malabsorption. In specific clinical conditions need specific examinationtoo. Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth can be diagnosed directly by culture from aspiration of duodenal fluid or indirectly byusing breath test. Bile acid malabsorption can be diagnosed by by measured bile acid radioactif labelled measured of metaboliteserum, and bile acid excretion. Lactose malabsorption can be diagnosed by lactose assay, breath test (hydrogen 14C Lactose and 13C lactose). Increasing orocaecal transit time diagnosed by using barium study, radionucleide scintygraphy, lactose hydrogenbreath test. Chronic diarrhoea due to increasing hormones producing tumours diagnosed by measured increasing level of hormonesin to serum. Investigations patients with chronic diarrhoea available in the ambulatory or hospitalised patients. Treatment ofchronic diarrhoea depends on the specific aetiology and may be curative, suppressive or empirical."
