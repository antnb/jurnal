Rejection is the most important complication. If hyperacute rejection ocured, kidney transplant must be take over to avoidmore severe systemic inflammation respon. New generation of humanized IL-2 receptor antibody, daclizumab (zenapax) candecrease the incident of hyperacute rejection. Acute rejection can be treated with steroid, polyclonal antilymphocyte globulin,monoclonal antibody OKT3 and plasma exchange. Chronic rejection was difficult to treat. Immunosupresion agen have no muchrole because destroyed were occured. Prevention just to manage risk factors and then wait the other transplantation.
