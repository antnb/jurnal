## Abstract:
"Saiful Anwar Hospital (SAH) doesn?t have standardized Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) liquefying tools. Standard OperatingProcedure (SOP) to liquify FFP at SAH is put the FFP on the table until diluted. Recently a new Thawer of FFP wasdeveloped in SAH. In this study we compared between the two methods which are convensional and the new one. Thirttytwo bag of FFP were divided in two different treatments which is group of new Thawer and the convensional. Eachliqueed bag of FFP was recorded the time of liquefaction, aPTT, PPT and INR. Statistical analyses using independent Ttest or Mann-Whitney as alternative. In this study found mean time of liquefaction of FFP on Thawer group were shorterthan conventional method 25.32 ± 3.4 vs 50.38 ± 5.52 minutes and statistically signicant (p &lt; 0.05). Mean of aPTT onnew Thawer group is 36.79 ± 5.94; but on conventional method is 36.94 ± 5.53 second (p = 0.67). Mean of PPT 11.71 ±0.95 second on new Thawer group and 11.84 ± 2.22 second on conventional method (p = 0.249). Mean INR each groupwere 1.02 ± 0.08 on new Thawer group and 1.03 ± 0.19 on conventional method (p = 0.234). This study shows that newFFP Thawer liquifay FFP more quickly than conventional method without decreasing the quality of FFP."
