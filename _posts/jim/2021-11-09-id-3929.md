## Abstract:
"Obesity is rapidly becoming a global problem not only in developed countries but also in developing countries such asIndonesia. Visceral obesity (central obesity) is an importance risk for cardiovascular disease and recognition that adipose tissuecan be regarded as a large endocrine organ that secreted inflammatory and anti inflammatory molecules (adiponectin). This studyaims to know the correlation between central obesity and adiponectin in geriatric Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) patients.Thisstudy was cross sectional analytic study of geriatric CHD at out and in patients in Sanglah Hospital. Data are presented as groupmean ± SD and analyzed by t-test, chi-square, and Pearson correlation with SPSS 12 software.Forty five patients (35 males and 10 females), 23 patient unstable angina pectoris, 14 patient acute myocardial infarction,and 8 patient stable angina pectoris were recruited and examined. There was high prevalence of central obesity 51.1% (23patients). Mean of log adiponectin were significantly difference between central obese and non central obese (1.80 ± 0.61 vs 1.09± 0.41 with p). Central obesity increased risk of hypoadiponectinemia 5 times than non central obesity (p = 0.011, CI 95% 1.4- 17.8). Waist circumference has negative correlation with log plasma adiponectin (R = -0.663, p &lt; 0.001).There was high prevalence of central obesity in geriatric coronary heart disease patients. Central obesity increased risk ofhypoadiponectinemia 5 times than non central obesity. Waist circumference has negative correlation with plasma adiponectin.Increased of waist circumference will decrease of adiponectin (cardioprotective protein) and will increase risk of Acute CoronarySyndrome in geriatric patients."
