## Abstract:
"Ambient air pollution often associated with allergic diseases and impaired respiratory function. Total serum IgE levels was one of the diagnostic tools to establish an allergic diseases while lung function test was standard examination to establish alteration in lung function. Trafc police ofcers were often assigned on the highway is one of the mostvulnerable population against exposure to air pollution. Aim of this study isto know the association between air pollution on total serum IgE levels and lung function in trafc police ofcers compared to staff police ofcer as control.This is anobservational analysis study with cross sectional design.There were 60 police ofcers as a subject, divided in two groups.Thirty subjects as exposured groups and 30 subjects as control group. Air pollution was measured by Pollutant StandardIndex (PSI)/ Indeks Standar Pencemar Udara (ISPU) method. Independent t-test and Mann-Whitney test were used to analyze differences between variabel. Spearman test was used to analyze correlation and strength between variabel.There were no signicant differences in total IgE serum levels between groups (p = 0.301). There were signicant differencesin FEV1 (%p) (p = 0.015), FVC (%p) (p = 0.000) and spyrometry result (p = 0.001). There was no signicant differencein FEV1/FVC ratio (p = 0.573). There were negative weak association between air polution and FEV1 (%p) (r = -0.298;p=0.021) and between air pollution and spyrometry result (r = -0.380; p = 0.003). There was negative moderate associationbetween air pollution and FVC (%p) (r = -0.409; p = 0.001). There was no association between air pollution and FEV1/FVC ratio (r = 0.058; p = 0.662). There was signicant association between air pollution and impaired respiratory functionbut there was no association between air pollution and total serum IgE levels."
