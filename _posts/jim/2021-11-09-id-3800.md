## Abstract:
"Intracellular signal transduction occurs through cascades of reactions involving dozens of proteins that transmit signalsfrom the cell surface, through a crowded cellular environment filled with organelles and a filamentous cytoskeleton, to specifictarget. For most characterized signal transduction pathway, the initial signaling event and the end point are well known. In order tofully understand intracellular signal transduction, it is essential to know the intermediate signaling molecules and to understandhow information flows from one to the next. The cytoskeleton , an interconnected assembly of actin (microfilament), intermediatefilament and microtubule networks that extend throughout the entire cell, is involved in intracellular signal transduction.Individual proteins of the cytoskeleton might participate directly in signal transduction by linking two or more signaling proteinand might also provide a macromolecular scaffold, which spatially organizes components of a signal transduction cascade.Diabetes mellitus is an increasingly common disease. Absolute or relative deficiencies of insulin are common in this disease.Insulin has been suggested to play a key regulatory role in the functional organization of actin filaments. The microtubules are alsothe targets of insulin. A chronic insulin deficiency may could lead to impairment in the organization of the cytoskeleton. Thiscould entail a compromised or slower action of some activated enzymes in cells, affect to intracellular signal transduction."
