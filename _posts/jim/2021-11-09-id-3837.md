## Abstract:
"Thrombocytopenia represent one of non specific laboratory criterion to uphold diagnosed DHF specifiedby WHO. Existence of trombositopenia on third or fourth days of disease, will be easily diagnosed of DHF. Toknow the pattern of the thrombocyte amount on children suffering from DHF based on IgG and IgM serologicmarker. This Research is retrospective study by seeing medical report of pediatric patient which is taken care byDHF in Sanglah Hospital Denpasar from July 2005 until June 2006. There are 42 pediatric patient sufferingfrom DHF with the positive serologi examination result, as much 17 child (40.5%) by IgG is positive, 9 child(21.4%) IgM positive and 16 child (38.1%) by IgG and IgM positive. At fourth days of disease development,the mean of the thrombocyte amount in serologi IgG are positive is the lowest (99.8 x 103/mm3). At fifth days,the mean of thrombocyte amount in serologic IgG and IgM are positive is the lowest (61.7 x 103/mm3). At sixthdays, the mean thrombocyte amount in serologic IgG are positive is the lowest (61.9 x 103/mm3). At seventhdays, the patient having positive IgG or positive IgG and IgM, the mean of the thrombocyte amount experienceof the improvement from previous day. At eighth days, patient having positive IgG and IgM were more oftenhave the thrombocyte amount more than the other (only IgG or IgM positive). The patient suffering from secondinfection (IgG positive or IgG and IgM positive) at the acute phase more often have the thrombocyte amount islower the than the primary infection (IgM Positive). Expected of continuation research with the sample amountand scope is more than before."
