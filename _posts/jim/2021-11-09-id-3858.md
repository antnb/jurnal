## Abstract:
"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a commonly reported condition among men with diabetes, however little is known aboutthe predictive factors associated with diabetic ED. To examine the predictors related to ED among type 2 diabetes outpatient, aconsecutive cross sectional study at Internal Medicine Outpatient Clinic, Sanglah Hospital was conducted, enrolled 137 type 2diabetes men aged between 35 ? 77 years old. We found 79.5% of type 2 diabetics with ED. Erectile function score was significantlycorrelated with other component of International Index of Erectile Function 15 (IIEF 15) including orgasmic function(r=0.622, p&lt;0.001), sexual desire (r=0.782, p&lt;0.001), intercourse satisfaction (r=0.911, p&lt;0.001), and overall satisfaction (r=0.842,p&lt;0.001). Erectile function was also correlated with age (r=0.315, p&lt;0.001). Chi square analysis among diabetic complication,ED were significantly higher among patient with albuminuria/proteinuria (p=0.025, prevalence ratio 7.43 (95% IC 0.95 ? 58.15).Other factors such as duration of diabetes, central obesity, cigarette smoking, alcoholism, diabetic control (HbA1C and lipidprofile), diabetic complications, and hypertension were not significantly correlated with ED. ED were high among type 2 diabeticsand erectile function were correlated with orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction.ED also correlated with age and albuminuri/proteinuria but not with other predictors."
