## Abstract:
"Liver Þ brosis is the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins including collagen that occurs in most typesof chronic liver. The gold standard to assess disease severity of liver Þ brosis is liver biopsy, despite noninvasive methodsavailable today. A noninvasive tool (Þ bro scan) has been developed these days. This tool is similar to ultrasound in assessingliver elasticity. There are three methods frequently used to assess liver Þ brosis, Ishak score, Metavir score, and Desmet/Scheuerstaging system. The principles of antiÞ brotic therapy are: (a) to treat primary disease; (b) to reduce inß ammation responseor to avoid stimulation of stellate cell activation; (c) to reduce stellate cell activation; (d) to neutralize proliferation response,Þ brogenic response, contractic response, and/or stellate cell proinß ammation; (e) to stimulate apoptosis of stellate cell; and (f) toincrease degradation of Þ brotic tissue."
