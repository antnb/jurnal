## Abstract:
"Handgrip strength is necessary for performing activities of daily living, which, in turn, are required to maintain functionalactivity. The purpose of this study was to determine anthropometric and personal factors that affect handgrip strength in groupsof nursing home and out patients of Sanglah Teaching Hospital Denpasar-Bali. Body weight and height, Waist Circumference(WC), Mid-Upper-Arm Circumference (MUAC) and triceps skinfold, scapula skinfold and supra iliaca skinfold were obtainedusing standard techniques. Body height was estimated from kneeheight. Handgrip was measured using a mechanical handgripdynamometer. A total of 38 male and 53 female aged 60 ? 82 years participated in the study. Both groups were statistically similarregarding all factors studied. Bivariate analyses showed that handgrip strength was associated with sex, age, WC, hemoglobin,albumin and body mass index in both of groups. Multiple linear regression analysis identified sex and WC (r = 0.39; p = 0.00),sex and age (r = 0.71; p = 0.00), as independent determinants of handgrip strength in both of groups. We conclude that womenhave a smaller handgrip strength than men. In addition, handgrip strength decreases with increasing age and decreasing WC."
