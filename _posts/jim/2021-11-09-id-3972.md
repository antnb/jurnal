## Abstract:
"Vascular complications develop progressively from 5 ? 40 years after the onset of diabetes, although they may appearearlier in type 2 diabetes when associated with a periode of undiagnosed diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance.Endothelial dysfunction is the proposed site of both micro vascular and macro vascular complications in diabetes.Endothelial dysfunction has been documented in both type1 and type 2 diabetes and is present in the insulin resistancesyndrome and in pre diabetes. There were will likely be a subsequent increased burden of vascular complications ofdiabetes, including diabetic nephropathy (DN). It is predicted that 25% of newly diagnosed patient with type 2 diabeteswill develop early stage DN within the next 10 years. Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs), which accumulate indiabetic vasculature, result in enhanced expression of endothelial cell-associated Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1(VCAM-1) as well release of a soluble form of VCAM-1 (sVCAM-1) into culture supernatants. We hypothesized thatsVCAM-1 in diabetic plasma might reect early vascular perturbation in diabetic vasculopathy. The aims of this studyis to know the prol of sVCAM-1 and albuminuria in type 2 diabetes. A cross sectional study to measure sVCAM-1andalbuminuria. Descriptive statistical analysis used to know the prol of sVCAM-1 and albuminuria. Of the 69 diabeticsubjects (31 males, 38 Females) with mean age of 57.4 ± 4.8 years, normoalbuminuria 39 subjects, microalbuminuria 23and macroalbuminuria 7 patients, and sVCAM-1 was 0.614 ± 0.177. The levels of sVCAM-1 plasma is increased alongwith stage of albuminuria. There was an increase of sVCAM-1 level along with stage of albuminuria."
