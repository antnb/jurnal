## Abstract:
"VoIP (voice over internet protocol) telephone communication using a data network. There is a change in switching from circuit switching technology into packet switching. Phone exchange can now use the Personal Computer equipped VoIP applications. Even the development of mobile phone technology to make VoIP communication can be performed utilizing the Smartphone. VoIP applications commonly use such as WhatsApp, Line etc. However, this application will cut the user data packets and often the quality is not satisfactory due to limited bandwidth and location of the remote server. During this time, Udayana University campus at several locations has been equipped with Hotspot network is mostly used to connect to the Internet. Hotspot network can also be used for voice communications with VoIP technology by adding a VoIP server. This concept not raises communication costs and should produce sound quality will be better because of the close location of the server. Because that researchers need to develop a model of telephone communication network utilizing Smartphone hotspot and students to be able to communicate in a campus environment. Method of this research is to develop a network utilizing hotspots and VoIP telephone exchange using the mini PC installed software FreePBX. On the side of the Smartphone using the free soft phone application and for aircraft used FXS analog phone as a codec. Tests will be performed for the communication between Smartphone and Smartphone to FXS terms of QOS and MOS produced. The results obtained, if the latency and packet loss have a value corresponding to the Real Time Protocol (RTP), the obtained MOS appropriate for the codec used while with the same codec if the value of packet loss and latency results are high then MOS obtained be small or less good quality. So the quality of VoIP is highly dependent on the quality of the signal obtained hotspot. In general, VoIP communication using a Smartphone connected to the server on the network hotspot mini pc can be used as a voice communication on campus."
