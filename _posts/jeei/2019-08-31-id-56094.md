## Abstract:
"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system showed the use of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) to perform the baseband modulation and demodulation. So that, it can increase and improve the efficiency of the modulation and demodulation. Currently, the OFDM is being utilized in the field of broadband wireless communication, which transmit signals orthogonally, that increases speed of information transmission. It also has high proficiency with high bandwidth and provide large data rates and robust against the multipath delay spread. On the other hand, there are some issues faced OFDM system which are high Peak Average Power Ratio (PAPR), and sensitive to Phase Noise (PN) and Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO). This paper presents Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) performance evaluation in the presence of CFO with two different environment scenarios were used: an AWGN channel and a Rayleigh fading channel. The simulation was performed to evaluate the effects of CFO based on Bit Error Rate (BER) vs. Energy Bit per Noise Ratio (Eb/No). The results showed that for BER degradation caused by CFO effects have presented in our simulation for both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channel."
