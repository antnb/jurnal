## Abstract:
"The increase of client devices along with the growth of internet access currently affects to security threats at the user's identity. Identifiers that commonly used today, such as SSID, IP address, MAC address, cookies, and session IDs have a weakness, which is easy to duplicate. Computer identification based on clock skew is an identification method that is not easily duplicated because it is based on the hardware characteristics of the device. Clock skew is the deviation of the clock to the true time which causes each clock to run at a slightly different speed. This study aims to determine the effect of network types to the clock skew stability as a reliable device identification method. This research was conducted on five client computers which running windows and linux operating systems. The measurement was conducted based on three different types of area networks, i.e., LAN, MAN, and WAN. The skew estimation was done using two linear methods i.e., linear programming and linear regression. The measurement results show that the most stable clock skew is found on the LAN measurement because it meets the threshold tolerance limit i.e., ±1 ppm. Skew estimation using linear programming method has better accuracy than linear regression method."
