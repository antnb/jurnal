## Abstract:
"One of telecommunication providers in Indonesia applies CDMA2000 1x technology. The technology hasmany advantages such as larger channel capacity of BTS (Base Transceiver Station). On the other hand, thecapacity depends on user’s density. Therefore to guarantee voice connection when user or mobile station (MS) isalways moving from one cell to others, handover technique is needed. However the technique can be failed for manyreasons. Therefore impact of call attempt on softer and soft handover performance is investigated. Hence the paperexamined soft – softer handover performance of CDMA in BTS (Base Transceiver Station), BSC, and Sectors inboth sub-urban and rural areas in Denpasar, Bali with area code of 0361.The research has been done in rural and suburban area with call area code ‘0361’. The analyses includedregression and simple linear correlation applications. The results showed that number of call attempts affected thefailure of soft and softer handover technique dominantly. Generally, average level of success both handover in bothrural and suburban area were about 99% which are above KPI (Key Performance Indicator) reference at 98.50%.However in rural area, other factors such as blocking called attempt and error called number have caused the softerhandover failure."
