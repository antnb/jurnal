## Abstract:
"This paper proposes a new approach to estimate the effective bandwidth for self-similar traffic in ATM network. In this approach we use the tail distribution of queue length based on FBM model. This approach is derived from the inequalities for Millsâ€™ ratio. Then a comparison with Norros and Trinh&amp;Miki schemes are analysed. The results demonstrate reasonable agreement between numerical and simulation results and between all schemes. Their bandwidth estimation tends closer for CLP improvement."
