## Abstract:
"In the current pandemic era, every learning process forced to do transition in a short notice, this action taken to prevent the widespread of COVID-19 virus in the school and university area. This hasty transition proceses are not companied by the readiness of Learning Management System platform that suitable for the education institution. This research is done by doing literature study and platform testing selected Learning Management Systems in order to fulfill its aim, to provide insight about Influencing Factors that can be used to segmenting Learning Management Systems Platform according to its suitability. This studi founds that there are 5 main factors and 3 supporting factors on deciding what Learning Management Systems Platform that will be use on any institution. The main factors consist of ease-of-use, course features, communication features, flexibility, and accessibility. The supporting factors consist of technician requirement, infrastructure requirement, and community support. From influencing factors, we also can devide Learning Management Platforms into 3 categories, there are free open-source, free cloud-based, and premium cloud-based."
