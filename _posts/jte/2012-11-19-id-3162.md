One of the examples isHuman Resource Administration Information System on Hotel Besakih Sanur, The Human Resource AdministrationInformation System has several processes, and these processes are still being done manually so they haven't beenable to give an effective an efficient result. This fact is the cause for building a human resource administrationinformation system that used information technology, so that it will be capable of managing the human resourcefunctions.System that is being build is applied by making the web based Human Resource Administration InformationSystem application using AJAX, this application also being completed by automatic absence application by usingfingerprint technology. The analysis that was being done is the analysis on user grouping, the usage of AJAX ondata processing, user interface, reporting, and the usage of fingerprint.Testing of the application is being done byinputting some data with a certain amount so that it would be known that the system can still work fine with a bigamount of data. But to avoid a big data growth especially on absence data, the system will move the data to a newtable each year. Usage of fingerprint in course of absence facilitate in inclusion of absence data."
