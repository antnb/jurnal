## Abstract:
"The ability to produce electrical energy at Solar Power Plant is highly dependent on the magnitude and duration of sun exposure on the solar cell panels. The movement of the sun from east to west that periodicity in every day is a problem at the optimization generation of electricity at Solar Power Plant if using solar panel that motionless. This is because the solar cell panel can not catch the maximum sun exposure. To solve the above problem then designed a solar cell panel tracker capable of follo-wing the movements of the sun. Then conducted a test to see the performance of solar cell pa-nel tracker and compare it with the performance of solar cell panel was motionless. The testing doing along 6 days, with way to irradiate the panel of solar cells tracker and panels of solar cell motionless with sun exposure along a full day. Then the electric current generated each panel were recorded. The comparison of current then generating comparison of electric power delivery. The result show that the solar cell panel tracker produce the average current is 2.19 A whereas solar-cell panel still 1.97 A. This result indicate that average power for solar cell panel tracker 39.41 W while for solar cell panel that motionless is 35.46 W. These results indicate that the performance of solar cell panel tracker better than solar cell panel motionless."
