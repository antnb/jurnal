## Abstract:
"Nowadays, the development tendency of information and communication technology is toward its flexibilityand ease of deployment. Cable networks require higher installation cost than wireless network. Therefore,implementation of wireless network, especially a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), becomes more populardue to its coverage and flexibility. The 802.11a is the first published WLAN standard from IEEE which offers widecoverage to stationary consumer terminals. In this paper OPNET Modeler Simulator was used to analyze theapplication standard of 802.11a. Simulation was done to study the characteristic of WLAN 802.11a with severalmeasured parameters such as data dropped (bits/sec), media access delay (sec), delay (sec), and throughput(bits/sec). The simulation was based on the scenario to study the coverage of an access point with the recommendedtransmitted power, and the effect of data rate on the access point’s"
