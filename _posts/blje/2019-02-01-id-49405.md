Ruteng Recreation Park area assignment is not determined by the collective perception that lack of support of the parties. Ruteng Recreation Parksetting legislation and its implementation does not guarantee the security of rights and indigenous peoples' access due to constraints of knowledge and understanding of the laws and regulations, resource constraints, regulatory and administrative development issues. The concept of the three pillars was not optimal because it has not reduced the rate of destruction of Ruteng Recreation Park and there were still conflict of encroachment and illegal logging."
