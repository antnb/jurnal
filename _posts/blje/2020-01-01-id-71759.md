The growth dynamics of urban forest tree unnatural. Micro-climatic conditions in the category uncomfortable are 29.75, whereas the condition ideally convenient in the range 25.0 - 27.0°C. The amount of carbon stocks in urban forest Industrial Estate Pulogadung of 77.27 tons/ha, while the average carbon density per hectare is 283.3 tons/ha. People's knowledge of the existence of the benefits of urban forests Industrial Estate Pulogadung as a producer of oxygen is greater (97.5%) of the thermostat (90%), and infiltration of rainwater (82.5%), while public attitudes as much as 83.75% agree to participate in managing the urban forest Industrial Estate Pulogadung."
