It’s continued by an analysis of the diversity, distribution, and dominanceof vegetation using theShannon diversity index, dominance index, and the important valueindex. The results of the vegetation analysis shows that Universitas Indonesia UrbanForest has a higher diversity of vegetation t han in Srengseng Urban Forest. The relationshipbetween the technical aspects which is density and the natural aspects which are thetemperature showed that temperature is related to density.
