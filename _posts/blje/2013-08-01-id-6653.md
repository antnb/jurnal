The study started by printing four different cards withstandard, standard with bigger fonts, descriptive norms, and norms of reciprocationmessages. Cards were placed in rooms of a hotel located in Bali. Results show that cardsprinted with descriptive norms and norms of reciprocation messages were indeed moredominant than the standard one in increasing participation in linens and towels reuseprogram.
