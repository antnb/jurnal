## Abstract:
"AbstractSeven Brassica napus cultivars were field tested to find out their adaptability andproductivity in tropical dry land environment. The aim of this research is to identifypotentially high oil yielding and agronomically stable Brassica napus genotypes as a newsource of biodiesel in Indonesia. Crop evaluation includes germination rate, plant height,number of leaves and stomata, flowering time, harvesting time, seed yield and oil content.Oil extraction using ’cold pressing’ technique were trialed. Results show that all genotypeshave good adaptability, therefore can be an alternative for biodiesel sources in Indonesia.Variation occurs on plant height, number of leaves, flowering time, seed set and oil content.‘‘Tanami’’, ‘‘Trigold’’ and ‘‘Trilogy’’ has similar performance, short plants, high pod set andearly flowering, while other cultivars have vigorous, tall plant habit but lower seed set.Some cultivars have an early flowering type while others has intermediate or late flowering.Pod set was excellence; however, seed set was low due to pest attack, namely Diamondbackmoth. Oil content of the seeds ranging from 2.6 to 11 %. In conclusion, B. napus areadaptable in dry land environment. Further study is needed to maximize seed productionand oil content."
