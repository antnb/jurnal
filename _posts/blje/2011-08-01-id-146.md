Included: First, employment of modern agriculture by using inorganic fertilizers and pesticides has been found to make a lower wetland soil quality. Second, by contrast, transformation of modern agriculture into organic agriculture causes soil quality improving. Third, beside, the improvement of soil quality employment of organic agriculture in the location where the study was performed also found that environment quality is improving."
