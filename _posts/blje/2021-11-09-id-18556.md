In this case, pemali (customary prohibition) along with the beliefand customs serving as the background is seen as an environmental wisdom.The conclusion in this paper confirms that the pemali mentioned above are still relevant andimportant to be understood and actualized in order to preserve the Subak Jatiluwih and tostrengthen various regulations having been enacted to protect and preserve the elements ofBalinese culture that need protecting and preserving. This strategic measure is to adoptcultural values contained in the belief and customs that underlie the pemali in the regulationsmade by relevant government authorities and in bylaws (awig-awig) of the Jatiluwih CustomaryVillage and bylaws (awig-awig) of the Subak Jatiluwih."
