Purpose: The purpose of this study was to prove mulligan bent leg raise more effective to increase lumbosacral range of motion and decreased disability than slump stretching among tile craftsman with Mechanical low back pain in Darmasaba village. Methods: This research was an experimental study with pre and post test control group design. Sample of this study is tile craftsman with mechanical low back pain with 20 samples aged 30-55. Samples were divided into two groups, which the first group (n = 10) was given Mulligan bent leg raise, while the second group was given slump stretching. Do exercise 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Lumbar range of motion was measured with modified-modified schober test while level of disability was measured with modified oswestry disability index. Result: Paired Sample T-test in Group 1 and Group 2 obtained p=0,000 that showed in each Group 1 and Group 2 there is significant difference. Independent Samples Test of Group 1 and Group 2 showed the result p=0,000 which mean that there is significant difference in increased lumbar range of motion and decreased disability. Conclusion: Mulligan bent leg raise more effective to increase lumbosacral range of motion and decreased disability than slump stretching to tile craftsman with mechanical low back pain in Darmasaba village."
