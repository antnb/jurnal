Elderly gymnastics showed theoretically significantly lowered thepercentage of body fat that result in a decrease in waist circumference, increasing the capacityof the memory function, and mental efficiency. This study was a pre-experimental study, carriedout in the Jegu Tabanan Village in February 2014 to September 2015 with a sample of 63 elderly.An abnormal waist circumference (central obesity) defined of &gt; 90 cm in men and &gt; 80 cm inwomen. The data were measured before and after the intervention (elderly gymnastic training)for the six months (once a week, in the morning, at the village hall (Balai Banjar) of JeguTabanan Village, and was guided by an elderly gymnastic instructor.

The results of thebivariate statistical analysis by paired t-test showed a significant difference between waistcircumference before and after giving elderly gymnastics for six months with the value of p =0.023 (CI: 0.449; 5.773). Also we found reduction in waist circumference of 3 cm (3.6%)."
