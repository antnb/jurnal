Quality of life in COPD patients measured by SGRQ questionnaires. The number of study subjects were then grouped at random into two groups.

The study was conducted for 12 weeks. SGRQ total value of the data was measured before and after treatment. All data in the analysis using SPSS version 16. Data are destributed normal and homogen, a decrease in the total SGRQ meaningful on breathing exercises and endurance training with a value of p = 0.000 (p &lt;0.05). This means that breathing exercises and endurance exercises at same time can significantly improve the quality of life. The mean total SGRQ values ??after treatment in group one and group two significantly different, where the value of p &lt;0.05, namely p = 0.000, a decrease of group two’s SGRQ total value greater than group one. This means that endurance exercise improves quality of life better than breathing exercises in COPD patients in BP4 Yogyakarta. It is expected to use endurance exercises in patients with COPD who experience mental decline in quality of life."
