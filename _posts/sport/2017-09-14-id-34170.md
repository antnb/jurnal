Purpose : The purpose of this study prove that the combination of isotonic better than rhythmic stabilization to decrease disability in craftsman tile with myogenic low back pain in Darmasaba village. Methods: This study uses an experimental design with pre-test and post-test control group design. The experiment was conducted in Darmasaba village and subjects were 20 patients.Decreased disability was measured with the Modified Oswestry Disability Index (MODI) before and after training. Results: Statistical test results obtained, a decrease in MODI scores in the first treatment group showed that mean difference obtained 38.20±3.048 and for the second group obtained 31.80±4.050 with p=0.001.Conclusion: From these results it can be concluded that the combination of isotonic is better than rhythmic stabilization for decreased disability of tile craftsman with myogenic low back pain in Darmasaba village. Suggestion: For the next researcher can do follow up research to see long-term result of combination of isotonic and rhythmic stabilization for tile craftsman."
