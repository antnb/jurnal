## Abstract:
"This study aims to determine the distribution practice training raise the agility indribbling ball viewed from motor educability skills.The study was conducted with pretestposttestgroup design in the second semester students Program Study of PJKR PGRI University-NTT, with a number of samples 28 people who were divided into two groups and each grouptotaled 14 people. Both groups were equally practical training distribution with high and lowmotor educability abilities, conducted for 8 weeks with a frequency of exercise 3 times per week.The results were analyzed descriptively to variants age, height, weight, body mass index and themotor educability in both groups whose data were taken before the determination andimplementation of training samples. Normality test is using the Shapiro-Wilk test andhomogeneity test with Leven's test. T-paired test is to know different of agility time cost fordribbling of group 1 (high motor educability) with the average before training is 15.217±0.496seconds, and the average after training is 10.719±0.470 seconds with difference = 4.497 and theincreasing of percentage is 29.52% (p&lt;0.05). While at group 2 (low motor educability) loweducability motor group with a mean 15.746±0.662 seconds, and the average after training12.105±0.565 seconds with the different = 3.640 seconds and increasing of percentage 23.12%(p &lt;0.05). Results of the different effect of changes in time cost dribble soccer agility was testedwith t-independent between groups before and after training on the significance limit of ? = 0.05.The average of time changing before training with p?0.05, it means the early condition is equaland after training has value p&lt;0.05.These results indicated that the high motor educability groupand low educability motors are equally give effect to an agility increase (p &lt;0.05). However, theincreasing of high motor educability is better than the low motor educability. Suggested furtherintensified at high motor educability skills in the training process, athlete recruitment andimplementation of motion activity, because it gives the increasing effect."
