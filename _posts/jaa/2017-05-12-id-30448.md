Mertanadi farmer cooperative is the only cooperative in Bali that supply asparagus to many destinations including supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and other suppliers. The commodity is supplied by the cooperative members at Plaga Village, Petang district, Badung regency. The aims of this study are to find out logistic management of asparagus by Mertanadi farmer cooperative to the organizational consumers. This research was carried out to 17 organizational consumers of Mertanadi cooperative located in Denpasar city, Badung regency and Gianyar regency. Logistic management by the cooperative was analyzed using descriptive qualitative method, while the perceptions of the consumers to the commodity were analyzed using Likert scale.
