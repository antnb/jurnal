The study aimed to identify and categorize groups of buyers based on their characteristics, to select one segment of the potential market to enter, and to establish and to communicate the main benefits that differentiate the company's products with other products in the market. The research applies quantitative descriptive method by approaches of cluster analysis, crosstab, Multi Dimensional Scaling, and Correspondence Analysis which used primary data of 135 respondents.
