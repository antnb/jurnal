This study used the Cobb-Douglas requestfunction which is transformed into multiple linear forms of natural logarithms (ln).Theresults showed that the factors that influence consumer demand for cayenne pepper inDenpasar City, Bali Province were the number of family members and tastes. Priceelasticity at D = 0 (not interested in cayenne pepper) and D = 1 (interested in cayennepepper) shows that the demand for cayenne pepper is perfectly inelastic. Cross elasticityat D = 0 (not interested in cayenne pepper) and D = 1 (interested in cayenne pepper)showed that large red chilies, tomatoes, and shallots are items that were not related tocayenne pepper.
