Under these conditions, the purpose of the study was to determine the level of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of the farmers’ group members of Catur Amerta Sari in Banjar Pura, the village of Sebudi in cultivating chili, and to find out the more influential motivation in influencing the members of Farmers’ Group of Catur Amerta Sari in the cultivation of chilies.

The more dominant influential motivation was the intrinsic motivation. This is due to most of the Catur Amerta Sari’s Farmers still cultivate chili plants in order to meet the needs of its physiology.
