To know the figure out of constraints experienced from farmers it used qualitative descriptive methods. The results of the research in technical efficiency analysis all of production factors are not efficient and not significantly. The results of pricing efficiency, all these factors there is no efficient production. It also in factors economic efficiency of production is not efficient. That is because of production factors used to excessive, therefore when use of factors production should be reduced to achieve levels of efficiency. The constraints faced are most of the farmers low in their economic and obtain hard to run a farm input. Key words: efficiency, production factors, constraints"
