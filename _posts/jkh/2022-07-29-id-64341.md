The result of this research is that tourists perceive the implementation of green hotels at the Mercure Bali Nusa Dua hotel in the very good category with an average of 4.30 percent according to the tourists' views. Simple linear regression analysis, analysis between green hotels and tourists' decisions to stay overnight obtained the equation Y = 6.491 + 0.425X.

The coefficient of determination of value is 74 percent and the remaining 26 percent is influenced by other variables. By using the t-test statistical analysis proves that a significant level of 5 percent is accepted because the t value (16,999) is greater than the t-table value (1,984), in other words green hotels positively and significantly influence tourists' decisions to stay at hotels.
