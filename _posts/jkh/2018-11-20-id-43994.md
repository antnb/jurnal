The results show if parents have a big share of the decision in choosing education for their children, especially leading to tourism education. this is influenced by the current state of tourism development. Parents of students have the ideology of capitalism in sending their children to education tourism as an investment by way of investing in their children so that later can be picked by parents when the child completed education and get a decent job in accordance with the plans of parents. But the important thing is, the child has other interests and talents, not on tourism education such as mechanical and musical techniques so that coercive coercion called hegemony exists in this phenomenon. consequently that happens is when this child through the process of teaching and learning in the classroom occurs not seriusan or lack of interest in learning to students so that students perform actions that are not desired by parents and the school such as lazy to go to school, lazy to make tasks given teachers and things - other things are based on the unfavorable.
