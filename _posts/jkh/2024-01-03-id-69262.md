## Abstract:
"Abstract Bali Province is one of the destinations for tourism activities both locally and internationally, this can be proven by the rapid visitation of foreign and domestic tourists who came to Bali Province in the period 2013-2018. With this tourist visit, manpower is needed to support operational and non-operational activities in the tourism industry sector, especially in the tourist accommodation section. However, in this case, it also requires training both in theory and practice for the workforce who will later directly participate in the field work process in the required sector. In this case, apprentices are in the spotlight in the research, this is because the workforce of apprentices has different wages and working life conditions from the workforce of permanent employees. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that determine the Quality of Work Life of Interns (Trainees) at Hard Rock Hotel Bali. This research is located at Hard Rock Hotel Bali. The data sources used are primary and secondary data sources. The data collection technique used was observation with a participatory approach, interviews, questionnaires, literature study and documentation. The sampling technique used was non probability sampling with purposive sampling type of sample. The data used a Likert scale model with a calibration of the validity and reliability tests.
