Data collection methods are observation, interviews, questionnaires, literature study and documentation. The sampling technique uses saturated sampling because all members of the population are used as research samples, namely all employees who work at Rocka and Crudo restaurant with a total of 30 people. The data analysis technique used is descriptive qualitative and quantitative, then the data were analyzed using a Likert scale to determine the perception employees on Butcher performance. The results showed that the perception of culinary employees on the performance of Butcher in the Uluwatu Six Senses hotel was categorized in Good criteria with an average total questionnaire score of 4.09. According to the results of the interview Butcher has followed the applicable duties and responsibilities.
