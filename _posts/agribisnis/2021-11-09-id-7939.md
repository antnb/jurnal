Farmers from Petiga Village have been trying to develop croton as the object of business.

Yet, there are still many aspects that have to be taken into consideration in order to bring this business prospective especially to Petiga Village farmers. This research was conducted at Petiga Village, Marga District, Tabanan Regency with the aim at: (1) identifying internal factors (strengths and weaknesses) and external factors (opportunities and threats). (2) determining the position of the business, (3) formulating strategies that are relevant to be applied. Respondents of this research were determined on purpose, including the farmer, head of farmer groups, village agriculture field supervisor, and the head of Agriculture Departement from Tabanan Regency.

The results of the study showed that the major constraint of the progress development of croton agribusiness at Petiga Village was that most of the farmer lack of information regarding the market and the price of the product. Only a small group of farmers had an access to the direct market of croton.
