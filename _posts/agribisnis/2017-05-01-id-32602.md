## Abstract:
"ABSTRACT Treating Arabica Coffee Potentials as a Main Sector of The Export Commodity Bali Province The last 5 years of Balinese economic growth has been stagnant (on average 5.5%), while it is better than the national economic growth (5.02%). Given these facts, Balinese economic development needs to be directed to the source of new economic growth to create a progressive, inclusive and equitable acceleration of economic growth towards the equity of the wider society. In line with this intention, this study aims to map the potential industry which then becomes the candidate for new economic growth.

However, in its development until 2014 the potential area can only be realized as a community plantation of 9,780 ha covering 3 regencies such as: Bangli, Buleleng and Badung, so there is still a potential remaining 46.4% of Bali's potential as a whole.
