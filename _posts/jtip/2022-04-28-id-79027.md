## Abstract:
"Artikel ini memiliki tujuan guna mengkaji pemberian serta perlindungan hukum paten Arak Bali yang dewasa ini baru memperoleh sertifikat patennya dari Kementerian Hukum dan HAM Republik Indonesia. Artikel ini tergolong penelitian hukum normatif yang menggunakan pendekatan perundang-undangan dan pendekatan konseptual. Berdasarkan hasil analisis, diketahui bahwa Arak Bali yang mendapatkan paten dari Kementerian Hukum dan HAM adalah Arak Bali sebagai obat tradisional, bukan Arak Bali oplosan yang kerap beredar di masyarakat. Pemberian paten didasarkan oleh penemuan karya yang inovatif serta untuk mengindari klaim yang mengaku sebagai obat tradisional seperti Arak Bali. Terkait perlindungan hukum, perlindungan untuk hak paten didapatkan setelah sertifikat paten diberikan. Sebagaimana telah diberikannya paten, perlindungan indikasi asal terhadap minuman alkohol tradisional terutama indikasi geografis yang dalam artikel ini mengkhususkan pada perlindungan hukum hak paten terhadap Arak Bali sebagai obat tradisonal akan berdampak baik bagi perekonomian masyarakat lokal yang melakukan komersialisasi Arak Bali. Karena Arak Bali berpotensi besar untuk masuk pasar ekspor sebagai obat tradisional khas Bali. Dibutuhkan adanya kerjasama dari berbagai pihak terutama masyarakat umum serta pemerintah untuk menjaga dan mengelola Arak Bali sebagai kekayaan intelektual bernilai jual tinggi. Kata Kunci: Paten, Arak Bali, Perlindungan Hukum, Kekayaan Intelektual ABSTRACT This article aims to examine the granting and legal protection of Arak Bali's patents, which recently received a patent certificate from the Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia. This article is classified as a normative legal research that uses a statutory approach and a conceptual approach. Based on the results of the analysis, it is known that the Balinese Arak that received a patent from the Ministry of Law and Human Rights is the Balinese Arak as a traditional medicine, not the adulterated Balinese Arak which is often circulated in the community. The granting of patents is based on the discovery of innovative works and to avoid claims that claim to be traditional medicines such as Arak Bali. Regarding the legal protection, protection of patent rights is obtained after a patent certificate is granted. As a patent has been granted, the protection of indications of origin for traditional alcoholic beverages, especially geographical indications, which in this article focuses on the legal protection of patents for Balinese Arak as a traditional medicine, will have a good impact on the economy of the local community who commercializes Balinese Arak. Since Balinese Arak has great potential to enter the export market as a traditional Balinese medicine. It takes cooperation from various parties, especially the general public and the government to maintain and manage Balinese Arak as intellectual property with high selling value. Key Words: Patent, Arak Bali, Legal Protection, Intellectual Property"
