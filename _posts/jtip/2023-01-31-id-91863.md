## Abstract:
"Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis pengaturan gugatan sederhana yang pertama kali diatur melalui PERMA No. 2/2015, kemudian dirubah melalui PERMA No. 4/2019. Penulis menggunakan metode hukum normatif (library research) secara deskriptif dengan pendekatan perundang-undangan (statute approach) dan pendekatan konseptual (conceptual approach). Hasil dari penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa perubahan pengaturan ini betujuan mendorong pengimplementasian asas trilogi peradilan lebih optimal. Perubahan terhadap PERMA tentang Gugatan Sederhana, Pertama meningkatnya batasan terhadap nilai gugatan materiil yang dapat diselesaikan menggunakan mekanisme penyelesaian gugatan sederhana yakni paling banyak Rp. 500.000.000,00 (lima ratus juta rupiah). Nilai gugatan materiil sebelumnya maksimal hanya Rp. 200.000.000,00 (dua ratus juta rupiah), dalam praktiknya dinilai terlalu rendah dan tidak dapat mewakili representasi setiap wilayah di Indonesia berakibat pada banyaknya perkara yang tidak dapat diselesaikan dengan mekanime small claim court. Kedua, sebelumnya mengenai kedudukan hukum para pihak hanya dibatasi oleh syarat harus berada di wilayah yang sama, kemudian diperluas jangkauan pengadilan sehingga para pihak yang tidak berdudukan di wilayah yang sama diberikan kesempatan untuk menunjuk kuasa insidentil yang berada di wilayah sama dengan hukum Tergugat. Dalam hal ini adanya PERMA No. 3/2018 mempermudah para pihak dalam penggunaan layanan e-court. Ketiga, berkenaan dengan pemanggilan para pihak diatur lebih rinci dalam Perma yang baru mengenai keadaan tertentu hakim dapat memutus perkara secara verstek dan contradictoir serta upaya hukum yang dapat dilakukan para pihak apabila keberatan dengan putusan tersebut. Keempat, pengaturan mengenai penetapan Aanmaning oleh Ketua Pengadilan. Kata Kunci: Gugatan Sederhana, Perubahan, Asas Trilogi Peradilan. This study aims to analyze the arrangement of a simple lawsuit which was first regulated through PERMA No. 2/2015, then it changed by PERMA No. 4/2019. The author uses the library research descriptively with a statute approach and a conceptual approach. The results show the change in arrangements aims to encourage the implementation of trilogy of justice principle optimally. Changes to PERMA for Small Claims, First, there is the increasing cap on the amount of material litigation that can be settled for a maximum of Rp. 500,000,000.00 utilizing a straightforward lawsuit settlement process. The prior material lawsuit had a maximum value of Rp. 200,000,000.00 which was deemed too low in practice and could not adequately represent each region of Indonesia. As a result, there were several cases that could not be resolved by a small claims court. Second, the court broadened its jurisdiction so that the parties who were not in the same region as the parties were still considered to be parties under the law. The existence of PERMA No. 3/2018 facilitates the parties use of e-court services. Thirdly, more information is provided in the new Perma regarding the summons of the parties, including the remedies available to the parties in the event that they disagree with the judge's decision and the conditions under which the judge may determine the matter in a contrary and ambiguous manner. Fourth, the plan for the Chief Justice's decision about Aanmaning. Keywords: Small Claim Court, Change, Principles of The Trilogy of Justice."
