## Abstract:
"Penulisan hukum dengan judul keabsahan akta notaris berbasis cyber notary ini bertujuan untuk mengkaji kepastian hukum pada pembuatan akta otentik bagi notaris yang menggunakan konsep cyber notary. Proses pengkajian penulisan dengan menggunakan pendekatan perundang-undangan sehingga metode yang digunakan ialah metode penelitian hukum normatif. Adanya wabah virus COVID-19 di Indonesia telah mengurangi mobilitas masyarakat dan beralih menjadi daring. namun, terdapat pembatasan bagi notaris untuk melaksanakan keseluruhan tugas dan fungsinya secara daring. notaris diberikan kewenangan lain yang diatur pada Pasal 15 ayat (3) Undang-Undang Nomor 2 Tahun 2014 tentang Jabatan Notaris. Salah satu dari kewenangan lain yang dimaksud memiliki konsep pembuatan akta secara elektronik ialah mensertifikasi transaksi, membuat akta ikrar wakaf, dan hipotek pesawat terbang. Adanya, konsep cyber notary tersebut ternyata memiliki konflik norma dengan Pasal 16 ayat (9) mengenai unsur kata dihadapan yang menjadi syarat formil sahnya suatu akta otentik sebagaimana tercantum pada Pasal 16 ayat (9) tentang jabatan Notaris. Untuk mengatasi konflik norma yang terjadi maka perlu digunakan kedua pasal tersebut sepanjang telah memenuhi ketentuan pada Pasal 16 ayat (7) Undang-Undang Nomor 2 Tahun 2014 serta terpenuhinya keotentikan akta yang diatur dalam Pasal 1868 KUHPerdata. Sehingga dalam melakukan tugas dan fungsinya dengan konsep cyber notary dapat dikatakan sah sebagai akta otentik karena undang-undang telah memberikan kewenangan tersebut kepada notaris. Kata Kunci: Cyber Notary, Keabsahan, Akta Otentik ABSTRACT Legal writing with the title of notary deed validity based on cyber notary aims to examine legal certainty in making authentic deeds for notaries who use the concept of the cyber notary. In the process of reviewing the author uses a statutory approach so that the method used is a normative legal research method. The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in Indonesia has reduced people's mobility and switched to being online. however, there are restrictions for notaries to carry out all their duties and functions online. Notaries are given other powers as regulated in Article 15 paragraph (3) of Law Number 2 of 2014 concerning Notary Positions. One of the other authorities concerned with having the concept of making electronic deeds is to certify transactions, make waqf pledge deeds, and aircraft mortgages. In fact, the concept of cyber notary turns out to have a conflict of norms with Article 16 paragraph (9) regarding the element of preface which is a formal requirement for the validity of an authentic deed as stated in Article 16 paragraph (9) concerning the position of a Notary. To overcome the conflict of norms that occurs, it is necessary to use the two articles as long as they have complied with the provisions of Article 16 paragraph (7) of Law Number 2 of 2014 and the fulfillment of the authenticity of the deed regulated in Article 1868 of the Civil Code. So that in carrying out its duties and functions with the concept of a cyber notary, it can be said to be valid as an authentic deed because the law has given that authority to a notary. Keywords: Cyber Notary, Validity, Authentic Deed"
