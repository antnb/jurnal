## Abstract:
"Penelitian mempunyai tujuan mencari tahu implementasi dari prinsip kepastian hukum serta prinsip transparansi pada pemerintah desa dan determinan yang menjadi hambatan implementasi prinsip-prinsip itu pada pemerintah desa. Penelitian ini ialah penelitian dengan sumber data primer serta sekunder. Adapun data dikumpulkan dengan observasi, lalu diolah kemudian dianalisis kualitatif. Temuan memperlihatkan imp;ementasi prinsip good governance terutama prinsip transparansi serta kepastian hukum belum berjalan optimal lantaran ada sejumlah penyebab seperti BPD belum secara maksimal melaksanakan evaluasi sebab sejumlah anggota BPD mempunyai tugas lain di luar pekerjaan utama. Tak hanya itu, aparat desa yang kebanyakan berlatang belakang pendidikan minim yang menyebabkan mereka tak memahami prosedur pelayanan operasional kepada masyarakat, serta karena ada kekosongan jabatan yang menjadikan sekretris desa mau tak mau melakukan rangkap tugas sebagai Kepala Desa, hal ini menjadikan aktivitas administrasi melamban. Pemerintah desa jua tak memanfaatkan sistem yang mampu mendukungnya dalam segi transparansi pemerintahan desa. Kata Kunci: Kepastian Hukum, Prinsip Transparsi, Pemerintahan Desa. ABSTRACT The research has the aim of finding out the implementation of the principle of legal certainty and the principle of transparency in the village government and the determinants that hinder the implementation of these principles in the village government. This research is a research with primary and secondary data sources. The data were collected by observation, then processed and then analyzed qualitatively. The findings show that the implementation of the principles of good governance, especially the principles of transparency and legal certainty, has not run optimally because there are a number of reasons, such as the BPD has not carried out the evaluation optimally because a number of BPD members have other duties outside of their main job. Not only that, most of the village officials have minimal educational background which causes them not to understand operational service procedures to the community, and because there is a vacancy in the position that makes the village secretary inevitably carry out double duties as Village Head, this makes administrative activities sluggish. The village government also does not use a system that is able to support it in terms of village government transparency. Key Words: Legal Certainty, Principle of Transparency, Village Government."
