## Abstract:
"Tujuan dibuatnya studi ini adalah menganalisis problematika aturan terkait hukuman mati kepada pelaku kasus korupsi di Indonesia, serta relevansi penjatuhan pidana mati kepada pelaku kasus korupsi yang terjadi saat pandemi Covid-19 berdasarkan Undang-Undang Pemberantasan Tindak Pidana Korupsi. Jenis penelitian hukum normatif dan pendekatan perundang-undangan digunakan dalam penulisan karya ilmiah ini. Hasil studi yang dilakukan memperlihatkan bahwasanya yang menjadi masalah pengaturan hukum terkait penjatuhan pidana mati terhadap koruptor adalah terbenturnya Undang-Undang Pemberantasan Korupsi pada Pasal 2 ayat (2) dengan Undang-Undang HAM dan Konstitusi negara Indonesia, hal ini karena HAM selalu menjadi tameng dalam penegakan hukuman mati di Indonesia sehingga korupsi sangat sulit untuk diberantas. Selanjutnya relevansi penjatuhan hukuman mati kepada terpidana kasus korupsi saat pandemi covid-19 dimana Indonesia saat ini tengah mengalami krisis, maka dalam kasus Juliari Batubara keadaan tertentu seperti maksud Pasal 2 ayat (2) sudah terpenuhi, sehingga hukuman mati merupakan hal yang relevan dijatuhkan kepada pelakunya, namun hakim hanya menjatuhkan pidana 12 tahun penjara dan 500 juta rupiah sebagai denda. Hal ini sungguh disayangkan karena sekalipun unsur keadaan tertentu tersebut terpenuhi, namun pelaksanaan tidak sesuai dengan aturan.Kata Kunci: Korupsi, Pidana, Mati, Covid-19 ABSTRACTThe purpose of this study is to analyze the problematic rules related to the death penalty for perpetrators of corruption cases in Indonesia, as well as the relevance of imposing the death penalty on perpetrators of corruption cases that occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic based on the Corruption Eradication Act. The types of normative legal research and statutory approaches are used in the writing of this scientific paper. The results of the study carried out show that the problem with legal regulation related to the imposition of capital punishment on corruptors is the clash of the Corruption Eradication Law in Article 2 paragraph (2) with the Human Rights Law and the Indonesian Constitution, this is because human rights have always been a shield in enforcing death penalty in Indonesia so that corruption is very difficult to eradicate. Furthermore, the relevance of the imposition of the death penalty on convicts of corruption cases during the covid-19 pandemic where Indonesia is currently experiencing a crisis, then in the case of Juliari Batubara certain conditions such as the intent of Article 2 paragraph (2) have been fulfilled, so that the death penalty is a relevant matter imposed on the perpetrators, but the judge only sentenced him to 12 years in prison and 500 million rupiah as a fine. This is really unfortunate because even though the elements of certain conditions are met, the implementation is not in accordance with the rules.Keywords: Corruption, Criminal, Death, Covid-19"
