ATM merupakan bagian produk yang dikeluarkan oleh bank, maka bank wajib memperhatikan dan memberi tanggung jawab terhadap dampak dari tindakan card skimming yang dialami oleh nasabah dengan mengantisipasi tindakan card skimming dengan cara membuat aturan yang berisi perlindungan terhadap nasabah baik secara kerugian materil dan immaterial guna memberikan rasa aman dan meningkatkan rasa kepercayaan dari nasabah terhadap bank. Namun dalam UU Perbankan mengenai pengaturan perlindungan hukum terhadap nasabah belum diatur secara komprehensif. Mengenai upaya penyelesaian masalah hukum antara pihak nasabah dengan pihak bank tentang kerugian oleh pihak nasabah akibat dari tindakan card skimming dapat ditempuh dengan berbagai cara, yakni: melalui mediasi non litigasi dan litigasi. Kata Kunci: Card Skimming, Perlindungan Nasabah, Penyelesaian Sengketa ABSTRACT The aim is to find out the form of accountability from the bank to customers who experience card skimming actions and to find out the settlement efforts of customers who get a loss for card skimming actions at ATMs. e-journals are included in normative legal research that leads to primary legal sources and secondary legal sources. In addition, in this study chose to use a statutory approach and legal concept analysis approach. ATM is part of the product issued by the bank, then the bank is obliged to pay attention and give responsibility for the impact of card skimming actions experienced by customers by anticipating card skimming actions by making rules that contain protection for customers both material and immaterial losses in order to provide a sense of secure and increase the customer's sense of trust in the bank. However, the Banking Law regarding the regulation of legal protection for customers has not been comprehensively regulated. Regarding efforts to resolve legal problems between the customer and the bank regarding losses by the customer as a result of card skimming actions, it can be taken in various ways, namely: through non-litigation mediation and litigation.
