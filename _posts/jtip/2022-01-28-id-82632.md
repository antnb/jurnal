## Abstract:
"Tujuan studi ini untuk mengetahui dan menganalisis pertimbangan hukum hakim dalam menentukan kesalahan terhadap pelaku tindak pidana pembunuhan berencana yang mengalami gangguan jiwa dalam Putusan Kasasi Mahkamah Agung Nomor : 815K/PID/2015 serta menganalisis penerapan pidana terhadap tindak pidana pembunuhan berencana yang mengalami gangguan jiwa dalam Putusan Kasasi Mahkamah Agung Nomor : 815K/PID/2015. Studi ini menggunakan metode penelitian hukum normatif dengan pendekatan perundang-undangan, konseptual dan pendekatan kasus. Hasil studi ini menjelaskan bahwa Pertimbangan hukum hakim dalam menentukan kesalahan terhadap pelaku tindak pidana pembunuhan berencana dalam putusan Kasasi Mahkamah Agung Nomor : 815K/PID/2015 sudah tepat dan benar. Karena Hakim Mahkamah Agung sudah mengadili sendiri Putusan Nomor: 815K/PID/2015 yang membebaskan Terdakwa Abdul Khalik yang dikarenakan Terdakwa terbukti melakukan tindak pidana pembunuhan berencana sesuai ketentuan Pasal 340 KUHP, akan tetapi berdasarkan hasil visum menunjukan bahwa Terdakwa mengalami gangguan jiwa yang berat, sehingga Terdakwa tidak dapat dipidana karena alasan pemaaf berdasarkan ketentuan pada Pasal 44 KUHP. Penerapan pidana terhadap tindak pidana pembunuhan berencana dalam Putusan Kasasi Mahkamah Agung Nomor : 815K/PID/2015 yang mengadili sendiri sudah tepat dan benar, karena Hakim Mahkamah Agung meyakini kebenaran Visum et repertum yang menerangkan bahwa Terdakwa mengalami gangguan jiwa yang berat yang tentunya tidak dapat di pertanggungjawabkan perbuatannya.
