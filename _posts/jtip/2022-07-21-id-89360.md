Penulisan ini menggunakan metode penelitian hukum normatif disertai mengkaji legalitas alat bukti elektronik dalam hukum acara pidana, melalui menerapkan pendekatan perundangundangan dan pendekatan konseptual, serta mempergunakan bahan hukum primer, sekunder serta tersier lalu hasilnya dijabarkan dengan cara deskriptif. Hasil penelitian ditunjukkan bahwa alat bukti elektronik dapat di hubungkan dengan 2 (dua) alat bukti pada hokum acara pidana yaitu menurut Pasal 184 UU HAP, yakni pada alat bukti surat dan petunjuk. Alat bukti elektronik dapat dikategorikan menjadi surat dikarenakan hail cetaknya berupa tulisan dan dapat dibaca serta diraba.

Alat bukti elektronik diakui menjadi alat bukti yang sah berdasarkan pada hukum acara pidana, perihal tersebut dikualifikasikan ke dalam alat bukti yang dicantumkan pada UU HAP, serta dipertegas dalam UU ITE.
