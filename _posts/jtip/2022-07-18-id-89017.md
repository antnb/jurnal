## Abstract:
"Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui dan memahami pengaturan regulasi terhadap pekerja yang memiliki cacat fisik untuk memperoleh persamaan dalam hal kesempatan serta mengetahui dan memahami implementasi perlindungan hukum terhadap pekerja yang cacat fisik dalam memperoleh kesamaan kesempatan kerja di Kota Denpasar. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah metode penelitian hukum empiris dengan melakukan pengkajian kesenjangan das sollen dan das sein. Pendekatan yang dipakai adalah pendekatan undang-undang dan pendekatan fakta. Sumber data yang digunakan yaitu data primer yang dilakukan dengan wawancara terhadap pekerja yang mengalami disabilitas di Kota Denpasar, sedangkan data sekunder yaitu peraturan perundang, buku-buku dan jurnal ilmiah. Hasil dari penelitian ini yaitu pengaturan mengenai penyandang disabilitas tertuang jelas dalam regulasi nasional yaitu dalam UU HAM, UU Penyandang Disabilitas serta UU Ketenagakerjaan, sedangkan peraturan khusus untuk Kota Denpasar tertuang dalam Perda Propinsi Bali Tentang Penyandang Disabilitas, namun meskipun sudah ada regulasi yang mengatur penyandang disabilitas di Kota Denpasar masih sulit mencari pekerjaan terutama di perusahaan karena adanya stigma bahwa penyandang disabilitas tidak bisa apa-apa. Dalam hal dunia kerja meskipun menyandang status sebagai penyandang disabilitas, meskipun negara telah membuat regulasi mengenai hal ini namun tetap saja realitasnya sangat sulit untuk ditegakkan terutama mengenai hal yang berkaitan dengan pekerjaan. Kata kunci: Tenaga Kerja, Disabilitas, Kesempatan Kerja This study aims to identify and understand the regulatory arrangements for workers with physical disabilities to obtain equality in terms of opportunity and to know and understand the implementation of legal protection for workers with physical disabilities in obtaining equal employment opportunities in Denpasar City.The research method used is an empirical legal research method by assessing the gap between das sollen and das sein. The approach used is the legal approach and the fact approach. Sources of data used are primary data conducted by interviewing workers with disabilities in Denpasar City, while secondary data are laws and regulations, books and scientific journals.The results of this study are that the regulation regarding persons with disabilities is clearly stated in the national regulations, namely the Human Rights Law, the Law on Persons with Disabilities and the Manpower Act, while the special regulations for Denpasar City are contained in the Bali Provincial Regulation on Persons with Disabilities, although there are regulations that regulate persons with disabilities. In Denpasar City, it is still difficult to find work, especially in companies because of the stigma that people with disabilities cannot do anything. In terms of the world of work, despite having a status as a person with a disability, even though the state has made regulations regarding this matter, the reality is that it is still very difficult to enforce, especially regarding matters related to work. Keywords: Labor, Disability, Job, Opportunities"
