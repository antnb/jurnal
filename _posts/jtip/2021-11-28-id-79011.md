## Abstract:
"Penulisan penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengkaji mengenai gagasan plea bargaining yang umumnya dianut dan digunakan di negara hukum common law system untuk bisa dilaksanakan di Indonesia, negara dengan sistem hukum dominan civil law system dengan tujuan memaksimalisasi pengembalian kerugian keuangan negara oleh maraknya korupsi di Indonesia. Penulisan ini memakai metode penelitian normatif juga beberapa pendekatan yakni pendekatan peraturan perundang-undangan dan pendekatan konseptual. Kesimpulan daripada penulisan penelitian ini ialah bahwa gagasan plea bargaining ini perlu dipertimbangkan untuk diimplementasikan guna mengembalikan kerugian keuangan negara semaksimal mungkin hasil tindak pidana korupsi di Indonesia yang detik ini masih sangat minim juga sulit dilakukan karena adanya kekaburan norma Pasal 18 Undang-Undang Nomor 31 Tahun 1999 jo. Undang-Undang Nomor 20 Tahun 2001 Tentang Pemberantasan Tindak Pidana Korupsi yang bukan sebagai pidana pokok sehingga terjadi keraguan-raguan oleh para penegak hukum untuk melakukan perampasan aset terhadap pelaku korupsi yang berakibat pada rendahnya pengembalian kerugian keuangan negara akibat korupsi. Sehingga terhadap Pasal 18 ini perlu ditetapkan sebagai pidana pokok untuk mengatasi kekaburan norma tersebut. Penerapan konsep plea bargaining di Indonesia juga dimungkinkan karena Indonesia telah meratifikasi United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), yang mengatur bahwa negara yang telah menandatangani konvensi berkewajiban melakukan pertimbangan pengurangan hukuman bagi terdakwa yang telah bekerjasama dalam penyidikan atau penuntutan kejahatan korupsi (Pasal 37 ayat (2)). Kata Kunci: Plea Bargaining, Common Law system, Kerugian Keuangan Negara ABSTRACT The writing of this study aims to research the idea of plea bargaining that’s generally used in the common law system country's to be implemented in Indonesia, a country with civil law system to aim of maximizing the return of state financial losses because of much corruption cases in Indonesia. This writing uses normative research methods with several approaches, which is the statute approach and conceptual approach. The conclusion is plea bargaining needs to be considered to be implemented in order to restore the country's financial losses as much as possible as a result of corruption crimes in Indonesia which is still very minimal, also difficult to do because of the blurring norm, Article 18 of Law No. 31 of 1999 jo. Law No. 20 of 2001 concerning the Eradication of Corruption Crimes that are not as the main criminal so there are doubts by law enforcement to take assets against corrupt actors which results in low return of state financial losses due to corruption. So Article 18 this needs to be established as the main criminal to overcome the blurring of the norm. The application of the concept of plea bargaining in Indonesia is also possible because Indonesia has ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), which stipulates that countries that have signed the convention are obliged to consider reducing penalties for defendants who have cooperated in the investigation or prosecution of corruption crimes (Article 37 paragraph (2). Key Words: Plea Bargaining, Common Law system, State Financial Losses"
