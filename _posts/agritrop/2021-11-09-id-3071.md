## Abstract:
"The desperation rate of CVPD disease on the central of citrus area in Bali were 32% per year, however thepopulations of D. citri as vector were relative low, so that the research concerning on the minimum population ofD. citri that effective as vector were needed. The aims of this research were to know the minimum population ofD. citri to transmit CVPD effectively, incubation periods of disease on citrus siam variety and the characteristicof pathogen on the vector. The research was carried out in the glass house of Department Plant Pest and Disease,Faculty of Agriculture Udayana University. The result showed that transmission of CVPD disease could be infectedby one imago of D. citri, through the increase of vector population decreased the infection period of CVPD diseased.Liberobacter asiaticum as the pathogen of CVPD had ability to persistent on the vector."
