## Abstract:
"A pot experiments was conducted in September 2000 until January 2001 at Experimental Station of Faculty ofAgriculture, Udayana University. The experiment was arranged in Completely Randomized Design with treatmentsallocation in factorial with three replications. The treatments were : the first factors consisted of four rates of N,P,Kfertilizers: F1 = 300 kg Urea, 75 kg SP.36, 50 kg KCl ha-1 (1.2 g Urea, 0.3 g SP.36, 0.2 g KCl pot-1) ; F2 = 250 kgUrea, 50 kg SP.36, 25 kg KCl ha-1 (1.0 g Urea, 0.2 g SP.36, 0.1 g KCl pot-1) ; F3 = 200 kg Urea, 25 kg SP.36, 0kg KCl ha-1 (0.8 g Urea, 0.1 g SP.36, 0 g KCl pot-1); F4 = 150 kg Urea, 0 kg SP.36, 0 kg KCl ha-1 (0.6 g Urea, 0 gSP.36, 0 g KCl pot-1). The second factors were three kind of alternative fertilizers : Fr (Floran), Gn (Greener) andDg (Dekorgan) each rate 3 l ha-1 or 1.333 ml pot-1 (concentrations 3 ml l-1 water). The results indicated that theinteractions between fertilizers rates (N,P,K) with kind of alternative fertilizers were not significantly different forall variable observed. The alternative fertilizers not significantly different for all variable too but fertilizers rates(N,P,K) affected the fertile number of rice tillers and highly significantly affected to the available P and K in the soil.The treatment of 250 kg Urea, 50 kg SP.36, 25 kg KCl ha-1 gave the highest fertile tillers (37.00 tillers pot-1) andavailable P in soil (10.18 ppm) but the treatment of 300 kg Urea, 75 kg SP.36, 50 kg KCl was observed the highestavailable K in the soil. The combination treatment of 300 kg Urea, 75 kg SP.36, 50 kg KCl ha-1 with Dekorganproduced the highest rice yield (65.69 g pot-1) or 58.14 % higher than the lowest yield produced by combinationtreatment between 200 kg Urea, 25 kg SP.36, 0 kg KCl ha-1 and Dekorgan."
