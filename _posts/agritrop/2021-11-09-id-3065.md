## Abstract:
"A research was conducted at the screening house and laboratory of Department of Plant Pests and Diseases,University of North Sumatra, Medan, under room temperature of 20-30oC and relative humidity 78-94%. Theobjectives of this research were to study the morphological and biological characteristic. The results showed thategg, first, second, third and fourth larva instars, and pupae stages of C. sexmaculata were 2,70 ± 0.82; 1,60 ± 0.51;2,30 ± 0.48; 3,10 ± 0.56; 4,50 ± 0,52 and 4,30 ± 0.48 days respectively. Fecundity was 136,20 ± 10.37 eggs, fertility81,82 ± 8,17% and life cycle 52,40 ± 0.69 days. The female lived for 31,20 ± 2,69 days longer than male whichwere 30,00 ± 3,26 days. Rate reproduction (Ro) = 5 and intrinsic rate of increase (rm) = 0,067."
