## Abstract:
"The objectives of experiment were: (1) to understand of effect concentration and timing of application of SuperACI foliar organic fertilizer, and (2) to determined of concentration and timing application of Super ACI foliarorganic fertilizer to sweet corn. The experiment was conducted at Rawa Makmur Village, Palaran Sub District,Samarinda City, on July 2004 until October 2004. The experiment design used was Completely Randomized BlockDesign in Faktorial Experiment 4 x 3 with three replications. The first factor was concentration of Super ACI (K)consisted 4 levels, namely: no Super ACI application (k0), 0,71 ml l-1 water (k1), 1,43 ml l-1 water (k2), and 2,15ml l-1 water (k3). The second factor was timing of application (W) consisted 3 levels, namely : 12, 24, and 36 daysafter planting (w1), 15, 30, and 45 days after planting (w2), and 18, 36 and 54 days after planting. The result ofexperiment showed that: (1) the concentration of Super ACI was significantly on the plant height at 42 days afterplanting, blooming time of male and female, harvest time, length of cob, diameter of cob, weight of cob, and affectedsignificantly on the yield of cob. The highest of cob yield namely 8,77 ton ha-1 was achieved on 1,43 ml l-1 waterof Super ACI; (2) timing of application was no significant on the plant height at 14, 28, and 42 days after planting,blooming time of male and female, harvest time, length of cob, diameter of cob, weight of cob, and yield of cob;and (3) no interaction between concentration and timing of application of Super ACI foliar organic fertilizer on theall parameters."
