The training consist of WISN software installation, presentation, discussion, and practices on how to use WISN software. The trainees were asked to fill in pretest and posttest questionaires.

All trainees were also able to conduct analysis using WISN software under the guidance of the trainers. The training has been well performed and successfully improved the knowledge and skill of RSUD Karangasem staff in applying WISN method. They stated their willingness to apply WISN method to their institution. However, further technical guidance is required to set up the system for the implementation of WISN method on human resource planning in RSUD Karangasem."
