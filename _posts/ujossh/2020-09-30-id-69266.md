Data collected by observation, interview and documentation, tthen, the researcher will write down the results of interviews with the English teacher and students This research shows that Professional English teachers often find it difficult when they have to teach English for Specific Purpose (ESP) as they need to do extra works like doing need analysis and creating the specific syllabus before teaching to make sure that the teaching-learning process will go smoothly.
