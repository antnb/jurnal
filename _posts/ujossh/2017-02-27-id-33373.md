Bina Nusantara International University has not Faculty of Social and Political Sciences as in UNUD but all the students get double degree with overseas universities and Communication department belongs to Faculty of Computing and Media of Binus International. Political education at Sociology department of UNUD has not yet increase the critical thinking of students by argumentation while Binus International urge their students to be more critical for any social changes and global politics. Utilizing the organizational of political parties by Basedeau dan Stroh (2008), as well as the critics from Heywood (2013) who said that political parties have not yet successfully implementing politic of education for people especially the youth. This research is the result of comparing the political education that has been minor in critical thinking at Sociology department at Unud Bali but in contrary, it becomes a major critical thinking for global politics topic at Binus International in Jakarta.
