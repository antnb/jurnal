The data was collected by documentation method, note-taking technique and by downloading the music video, watching and listening carefully and finding the signs and classifying the data according to the types. In analyzing the data, the theory of visual communication proposed by Dyer (1993) and theory types of meaning proposed by Leech (1983) were used. The finding of analysis shows 15 elements in six visual categories.
