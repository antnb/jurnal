## Abstract:
"Classification is data mining techniques which used for the purposes of diagnosis in the medical field as measured by the high accuracy produced. The accuracy of classification algorithm is influenced by the use of features and dimensions in dataset. In this study, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) dataset was used where the data is one of the high dimension datasets. Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used because its ability to handle high-dimensional data. In the dataset, it consists of 24 attributes and 1 class which if all are used results accuracy of classification will be diminished. Method for selecting features with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is applied to reduce redundant features and produce optimal features. In addition, ensemble AdaBoost also applied in this research to increase performance of entirety classification algorithm. The results showed that the optimization of SVM algorithm by using PSO as a selection and ensemble feature of AdaBoost with an average of selected features of 18 features could increase the accuracy of 36.20% to 99.50% in the diagnosis of CKD compared to the SVM algorithm without optimization only resulting in accuracy 63.30%. This research can be used as a reference for further research in focusing on the preprocessing stage."
