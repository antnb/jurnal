## Abstract:
"Multi-object recognition software on Remote Controlled Weapon Station (RCWS) had been implemented in previous paper using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) methods, but the processing time in one cycle is quite slow so it is need to be optimized using parallel processing. In this paper, implementation of parallel processing on multi-object recognition software has been done on a multicore processor. The Openmp Application Programming Interface (API), C programming language, and Visual studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is used to implement the parallel processing in this paper. The parallel processing was implemented in the for loop of the matching process between the capturing object from the camera and the database under two conditions, i.e., the original of the for loop syntax and after optimization of the for loop syntax. Experiments have been done on the core processor i7-4790 @ 3.60Ghz, 8 GB DDR3 of memory, windows 8.1 os using two, four, six, and eight cores to recognize one, two, three and four objects at once using SIFT and SURF methods. Based on the experiments, it was found that the processing time in parallel is faster than sequential process, where the fastest of the processing time is obtained after optimization in the loop syntax, with the processing time in recognizing one to four objects using SIFT method is 927.13 ms (8 core), 1019.31 ms (6 core), 1190.72 ms (8 core), and 1283.05 ms (4 core), where the sequential processing time in recognizing one to four objects is 1067.35 ms, 1164.78 ms, 1352.93 ms, and 1497.35 ms, while the processing time in recognizing one to four objects using SURF method is 1157.13 ms (8 core), 1517.83 ms (6 core), 1572.14 ms (4 core), dan 1472.64 ms (6 core), where the sequential processing time in recognizing one to four objects is 5635.99 ms, 6268.47 ms, 3256.63 ms, dan 3883.78 ms."
