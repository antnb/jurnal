## Abstract:
"Babies are very susceptible to germs of disease, environmental factors and lack ofsensitivity to the symptoms of a disease, of course is a distinct fear for parents. Therefore madea convenience by utilizing technology in the form of knowledge-based system that uses a webbasedmedia.Knowledge-based system for health and infant care is a web-based system that presentssolutions to overcome the disease in infant health problems and also provide treatment for anydisease problems encountered. This system provides the facility to help users diagnose thedisease in identifying health problems being faced by the baby. This identification process isdone through question and answer interaction between the system with the user or user-input and the lawyer's disease symptoms. The system also provides facilities for managingknowledge is performed by the system administrators who called the Knowledge Engineer inmaking changes to data in the knowledge base. With this facility, the addition of knowledge,change the rules in the knowledge base and system development through the acquisition ofnew knowledge can be directly done without having to dismantle the system that is so. This willallow the system to keep up to date. Methods of tracing disease conclusion which is used onthis system is tracking trace forward (forward chaining). Rules in the knowledge base ismodeled as a tree by using the MySQL database and PHP programming language.The results of this knowledge-based inference system is diagnoses the illness of the baby. Ofthe system implemented, the conclusion that in general the system can run well. Neverthelessthere is still a lack of success of early diagnosis of disease and very dependent on administratorwith expertise in building a knowledge base."
