## Abstract:
"Indonesian citizens who use motorized vehicles are increasing every year. Every motorcyclist in Indonesia must wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle. Even though there are rules that require motorbike riders to wear helmets, there are still many motorists who disobey the rules. To overcome this, police officers have carried out various operations (such as traffic operation, warning, etc.). This is not effective because of the number of police officers available, and the probability of police officers make a mistake when detecting violations that might be caused due to fatigue. This study asks the system to detect motorcyclists who do not wear helmets through a surveillance camera. Referring to this reason, the Circular Hough Transform (CHT), Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) are used. Testing was done by using images taken from surveillance cameras divided into 200 training data and 40 testing data obtained an accuracy rate of 82.5%."
