## Abstract:
"The need for unmanned vehicles is increasingly needed in certain conditions, such as distribution of disaster supply, distribution of medicines, distribution of vaccines in the affected areas in pandemic situations. The various types of goods to be distributed require a different fulcrum. This research implemented PID control for the quadcopter balance control system to achieve stability during hovering. PID control is used to achieve a certain setpoint to produce the required PWM output for the propeller to reach a speed that can fly the quadcopter tilted until it reaches a steady state. Tests were carried out on the roll and pitch motion of the quadcopter by providing a load. The results show that PID control can be implemented for the quadcopter balance control system during hovering by determining the PID constants for each roll and pitch motion with the constanta of Kp = 0.15, Kd = 0.108, and Ki = 0.05. The quadcopter takes 3 – 6 seconds to return to the 0 degree setpoint when it is loaded."
