## Abstract:
"Balinese script is an important aspect that packs the Balinese culture from time to time which continues to experience development along with technological advances. Balinese script consists of three types (1) Wrésastra, (2) Swalalita and (3) Modre which have different types of characters. The Wrésastra and Swalalita script are Balinese scripts which grouped into the script criteria that are used to write in the field of everyday life. In this research, the zoning method will be implemented in the feature extraction process to produce special features owned by Balinese script. The results of the feature extraction process will produce special features owned by Balinese script which will be used in the classification process to recognize the character of Balinese script. Special features are produced using the zoning method, it will divide the image characters area of ??Balinese scripts into several regions, to enrich the features of each Balinese script. The result of feature extractions is stored as training data that will be used in the classification process. K-Nearest Neighbors is implemented in the special feature classification process that is owned by the character of Balinese script. Based on the results of the test, the highest level of accuracy was obtained using the value K=3 and reference=10 with the accuracy of Balinese script recognition 97.5%."
