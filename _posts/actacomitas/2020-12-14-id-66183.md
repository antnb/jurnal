In Paragraph (1) it is stated that "deeds must be made in Indonesian", while in Paragraph (3) it states "if the parties wish, the deed can be drawn up in a foreign language". The disharmony of the 2 (two) rules could potentially reduce the perfection of the deed.

Then the objective of this research is to knowing the Notary's responsibility in making authentic deeds in foreign languages ??and to find out how much urgency the use of Indonesian is in making authentic deeds.
