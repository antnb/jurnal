## Abstract:
"Groundnut (Arachis hypogea L.) is one of important commodities in Indonesia, however the production of groundnut is still relatively low which ispartly because of the plant disease i.e. stem rot disease caused by Sclerotium rolfsii. Rhizobacteria is one of the solutions to be used as the biological controlagent against S. rolfsii. The aim of this study is to know the effectiveness of rhizobacteria to control stem rot disease caused by S. rolfsii. The results the studyshowed that among 130 isolates of rhizobacteria tested against S. rolfsii, 11 isolates showed inhibitory activity, and among them one isolate, BjTk11 fromexposed the highest inhibitory activity (96.09%) against S. rolfsii. On a green house experiment, treatment with formula of isolate BjTk 11 at doses of 5 g, 10 g,15 g and 20 g per polybag effectively controlled the pre emergence damping off (disease incidence = 0%) while the disease incidence on control was 23.5%. Nopost emergence damping off symptom was observed on groundnut treatment with formula of isolate BjTk11, while the disease incidence on control was 75%. The number of sclerotia in soil of control was 79/gram of soil which is obviously higher than those of treatments. The mode of action the rhizobacteria isolatesBjTk11 in inhibiting the growth of S. rolfsii is through antibiosis where the rhizobacteria produce the antifungal compound Butanedial, R - (-) - 1,2propanediol, 2,3-Butanediol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Acetic acid, anhydride with formic Acid , 2-bromohexane, 4,5-Diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine, 4H-Pyran-4one, 3-hydroxy-2-methyl and Cyclotrisiloxane, hexamethyl-. The presence of these compounds probably closely related to the inhibitory activity against S. rolfsii."
