Samples was selected using total sampling technique with totally228 samples which divided into 3 groups based from their body mass index. Normality test using Kolmogorov-smirnovTest and homogeneity test using Levene’s Test had been done (p&gt;0.05). Descriptive analytic show the visual reactiontime in underweight BMI 569,4+50,08 ms, normal BMI 405,31+41,54 ms and overweight BMI 556,75+46,86 ms. Analysisusing One Way ANOVA find out significant mean differences between group (p=0,000) Based on this study, concludethat underweight and overweight children had a longer visual reaction time than normal weight children in SaraswatiElementary School Tabanan.Keywords : Visual Reaction Time, Body Mass Index"
