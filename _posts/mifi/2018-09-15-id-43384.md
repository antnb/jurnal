Data collection was done by filling the Nordic Body Map questionnaire. Statistical test using Chi-Square and Independent T-test. The results showed significant differences in musculoskeletal disorder on wood carver and painter, with woodcarvers mean value of 40,7 ± 5,3 and painters mean value of 43,2 ± 6,2, so p = 0,038 (p &lt;0,05) , then there are differences in musculoskeletal disorder among woodcarvers and painters, where musculoskeletal disorders at greater painter than woodcarver. Analysis of the difference each extremity musculoskeletal disorders in the upper extremities get results with woodcarvers mean value of17.1 ± 0.38 and painters mean value of 17,3 ± 2,5, so p= 0,692 (p&gt; 0,05), on the trunk with woodcarvers mean value of 8,3 ± 1,69 and painters mean value of 10,5 ± 2,50, so p = 0,000 (p &lt;0,05) and in the lower extremities with woodcarvers mean value of 15,1 ± 2,69 and the average value of the painters 15.1 ± 3.33, so p = 0.973 (p&gt; 0.05). The results of the analysis of each extremity musculoskeletal disorders in woodcarvers and painters, it can be concluded that there are significant differences in musculoskeletal disorder among woodcarvers and painters on the trunk and there are no significant differences in musculoskeletal disorder among woodcarvers and painters in the upper extremities and the lower extremities.
