Data was collected by measuring the dynamic balance among the elderly people using Time Up and Go Test(TUGT)at the beginning and the end of theexercise in each group. The research showed significant result with p=0.000 in group I (tandem walk) and p=0.001 in group II(one legged stance).The test results show independent t-test p=0.000 the difference ofin dynamic balance. Based on these results it can be concluded that givingtandem walk exercises is better thanone legged stance exercise to increasing dynamic balance for elderly people. Keywords: dynamic balance, tandem walk, one legged stance, elderly people."
