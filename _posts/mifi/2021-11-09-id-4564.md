## Abstract:
"Objective: This study aims to determine the difference giving the frequency of asthmaexercise three times a week with once a week to improved Forced Vital Capacity (KVP), forcedexpiratory volume in 1 second (VEP 1) in patients with persistent asthma were measured usingSpirometry. Methods: The study was conducted with the design of pre test and post test groupdesign. Sampling Purposive sample taken with the inclusion criteria, exclusion. Samples weredivided into 2 groups, each group numbering 12 people. Group I will be given the treatment ofasthma gym three times a week in patients with persistent moderate asthma, exercise asthma group II are given once a week. Results: Data were analyzed by Test Paired sample t-testshowed that each group produces an increase in the VEP, and KVP before and after treatmentwere significantly different (p &lt;0.05). While the Independent sample t-test test aimed to comparethe two treatment groups for VEP 1, KVP shows that the value (p &lt;0.05). This means showingsignificant differences between the two treatments to increase VEP 1, KVP. Conclusion: Thismeans it can be concluded that asthma exercise three times a week is better than the gym once aweek to improved asthma Kapasital Forced Vital (KVP), forced expiratory volume in 1 second(VEP 1) in patients with persistent moderate asthma."
