Lavender aromatherapy is beginning to be sought as one of the non-pharmacological therapies because the use of NSAIDs is reported to cause many side effects. The main components of lavender, linalool (35%) and linalyl acetate (51%) are efficacious as analgesics and maximally absorbed through the skin. Objective: This study aims to determine the effect of lavender aromatherapy on the menstrual pain of female college students at the Persada Medika Institute of Bali. Methods: Quasy experimental with one group pre-posttest design. The study was followed by 38 female students with moderate to severe pain using the random sampling technique. Data were analyzed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test with p &lt;0.05. Results: The results prior to lavender aromatherapy showed moderate pain at 73.7% and severe pain 26.3%. After lavender aromatherapy was administered, they showed moderate pain at 21% and mild pain at 79%. The Wilcoxon test indicated that the value of p = 0,000, where p &lt;0.05.
