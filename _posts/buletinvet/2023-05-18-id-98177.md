## Abstract:
"Sporotrichosis is a mycosis that infects skin and subcutaneous tissue that is chronic. This infection is caused by thermodimorphic pathogenic species of the genus Sporothrix which are distributed worldwide and are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Transmission of sporotrichosis can occur through scratching, biting, or direct contact of injured skin with the exudate of a sick cat or directly from an environment that is contaminated either soil, plants, and decaying plant material. Sportricosis is a zoonotic disease, so it must be detected and given treatment as soon as possible so that it does not spread to other animals or to humans. A three-year-old, gray male Persian cat with a body weight of 3.2 kg was reported with a lot of dandruff all over his body. On physical examination of the skin and hair, many scales were found in all parts of the body, there was alopecia and crusts on the lateral cervical and left sides and on the dorsal side. On supporting examination using tape acetate preparation followed by cytological examination, Sporothrix spp. spores were found. The case cat was diagnosed with sporotrichosis with a fausta prognosis. Sporotrichosis in cat cases has a cutaneous clinical form with a dry lesion type. The therapy given was griseofulvin tablets 500 mg at a dose of 50 mg/kg BW administered once a day for 21 days orally, ivermectin injection (10 mg/mL) at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg BW subcutaneously. Selamectin (spot on) containing 0.75 mL (45 mg) is dripped on the nape of the neck one week after ivermectin injection, then it is recommended to cut the cat's hair short, and bathe the cat using medicated shampoo once a week. The development of the results of therapy on the 18th day of treatment showed hair growth in alopecia and crustal lesions on the lateral cervical and left and dorsal parts, but there was still scaly hair on all parts of the body, so therapy had to be extended and prescribed drugs that had higher effectiveness than the previous drug, namely itraconazole. Management of sporotrichosis requires a long period of time and routine treatment and it is necessary to carry out routine medical check-ups to determine progress."
