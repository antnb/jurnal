## Abstract:
"Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) is a disease caused by a virus that attacks the cat's immune system. Feline Hepatic Lipidosis (FHL) is the most common liver disease in cats caused by excessive accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes which causes cholestasis liver dysfunction. This case study aims to find out how to diagnose treat cases of jaundice in cats. A Himalayan cat aged 7 years weighing 3.3 kg was examined at the Listriani Vetcare Clinic in a weak condition. Previously, the cat was missing for 50 days was later found in a neighbor's barn where there was only rainwater seepage. On physical examination, jaundice was found on the ears, sclera, lips, abdomen, abdominal distention was observed. Hematology examination was performed twice on day 2 day 9, blood chemistry, ultrasonography, FIV/FelV test kit. Hematological examination on the 2nd day showed that the case cat had mild anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia. The 9th day hematological examination showed anemia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia. Blood chemistry results showed an increase in alkaline phospatase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, total bilirubin, bile acids, total cholesterol, a decrease in Blood Urea Nitrogen. Ultrasound of the liver showed a diffuse hyperechoic mass the FIV/FelV test kit was FIV positive. Based on anamnesis, clinical examination, laboratory tests, the case cat was diagnosed with hepatic lipidosis FIV with a dubious prognosis. Case cats were treated with Cefotaxime (20 mg/kg, IV, three times a day), Hematodin® (0,6 mL, IV, once a day), Ondansetron (0,2 mg/kg, IV, twice a day), Samylin® small (1 tab, once a day), Metronidazole (25 mg/kg BW, PO, twice a day) for 10 days, Urdafalk (15 mg/kg BW, PO, once a day), Lactulose® (3 mL, PO, three times a day). On the 5th day, ondansetron cefotaxime were stopped given Cephalexin (38 mg/kg BW, PO, twice a day), Iron (1 tab, PO once a day), vitamin B12 (0.2 mL IV) TF Advance® (1 capsule, twice a day). The treatment given did not improve the condition, the case cat died on the 13th day. It is recommended that owners do not provide access for cats to leave the house to reduce the possibility of cats getting lost or contact with other cats that can transmit disease."
