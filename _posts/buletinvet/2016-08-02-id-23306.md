## Abstract:
"Dirofilaria immitis (D. immitis) as a causative agent of heartworm disease is not only caused problems in animals but also zoonoses. For diagnosis of dirofilariasis (disease caused by D. immitis) serologically is needed anti-D. immitis antibodies. The objective of this study was to produce antibodies against excretory-secretory antigens produced by male and female worms for developing the diagnosis of dirofilariasis based on the antigens detection. Base on this study can be concluded that male excretory-secretory antigens (MES), female excretory-secretory antigens (FES), and MES+FES can stimulate BALB/c mouse to produce polyclonal antibodies in the same pattern. Antibodies have been produced at day 21 and the peak titter was at day 35 after first immunization."
