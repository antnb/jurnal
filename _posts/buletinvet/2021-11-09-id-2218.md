## Abstract:
"Syndromic surveillance is an alternative surveillance system which can potentially detectanimal disease outbreaks in the early stages. Although syndromic surveillance haslimitations for the detection of sub-clinical and specific diseases, the method has the abilityto detect disease outbreaks rapidly including clinical emerging issues. In addition,syndromic surveillance is a suitable surveillance tool that can be applied in developingcountries since it is a low-cost surveillance method and is an option for poorly-resourcedveterinary services."
