## Abstract:
"The purposes of this research were to determine the motility and viability of turkey sperm on egg yolk phosphate diluent with the addition of various concentration of vitamin C stored at 5oC. The source semen from one and half years old turkey, semen diluted with eggyolk phosphate addition with vitamin C 0 mg/ml (without vitamin C), 0.1 mg/ml, 0.2 mg/ml and 0.3 mg/ml respectively. Observation was done every 12 hours for 72 hours. The results showed thataddition of vitamin C significantly difference on motility and viability of turkey stored at 5oC theaddition of 0.3 mg/ml vitamin C gives the best results in maintaining motility and viability of turkey sperm after 72 hours. In Conclusion, the addition of 0.3 mg/ml vitamin C in egg yolk phosphate diluent able to maintain motility (69.07%) and viability (71.64%) turkey sperm stored at 5oC."
