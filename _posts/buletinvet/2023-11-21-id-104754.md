## Abstract:
"Variation on long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) dermatoglyphics in an island and genetic relationships interpopulations are still mainly unrevealed. Until now, there is no reports or scientific studies that reveal the data in Baluran National Park. This study aims to describe the variations of dermatoglyphic patterns of the long-tailed macaque population in Baluran National Park considering that the population of this macaque in the East Java Region has played an important role in the history of its distribution in the Southern Archipelago of Indonesia. The samples were 14 individual consisting of 10 male and 4 female captured randomly from Baluran National Park, Situbondo, East Java. Dermatoglyphic prints were collected using the transparent adhesive tape method. Analysis, found that there were 3 basic patterns of dermatoglyphics namely open field, whorl, and loop. The pattern types on both of the tips of the fingers and toes were are all uniform in whorl pattern. The open field pattern was the highest frequency pattern throughout the pattern area on both of the palms and soles with a percentage of 43.3%. The highest frequency of the open field pattern was found in the thenar and hypothenar distal pattern areas of the palms and in the thenar distal, thenar proximal, hypothenar distal, hypothenar proximal and calcar patterns areas of the soles. The frequency of the dominant whorl pattern was found in the interdigital pattern area II, III, and IV of the palms. The frequency of the proximal loop pattern subtype was found throughout the second interdigital pattern area of ??the sole. Further research is needed on the total number of ridges and the level of bilateral asymmetry of dermatoglyphic patterns of long-tailed macaques in Baluran National Park."
