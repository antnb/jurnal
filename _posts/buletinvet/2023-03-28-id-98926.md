## Abstract:
"Newcastle Disease virus as the cause of tetelo disease in Indonesia or avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1) is a type of oncolytic virus used as a virotherapy agent, due to its ability to lyse cancer cells in mammals including fibrosarcoma. As is known, the liver is an organ that functions in the detoxification of toxic and foreign materials that enter the body. The purpose of this study was to determine the side effects of the virulent isolate Newcastle Disease virus Gianyar-1/AK/2014 as a virotherapy agent on the histopathological features of the liver of white rats with fibrosarcoma. This study used 6 rats model of fibrosarcoma induced by carcinogens and then divided into two treatment groups consisting of three rats as replicates. Treatment 0 (P0) was injected with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and Treatment 1 (P1) was injected with Newcastle Disease virus isolate Gianyar virulent-1/AK/2014 at a dose of 0.5 mL / 28 HA units. The histopathological features observed at 400X magnification were in the form of degenerative lesions and necrosis of hepatocyte cells and were then given a score according to their severity. The results of the Mann-Whitney U statistical test showed that there was no significant difference in the score of degenerative hepatocyte lesions between the two treatments (P&gt;0.05). Meanwhile, necrotic lesions at P1 were lower when compared to necrotic lesions at treatment P0 (P&lt;0.05). Based on these results it can be concluded that this virotherapy does not damage liver cells and intratumoral injection of the virus causes a better histopathological overview of the liver compared to those not given virotherapy. However, further research is still needed regarding the effect of giving the virus to liver cells in order to see the effectiveness of fibrosarcoma cancer treatment using the Newcastle Disease virus."
