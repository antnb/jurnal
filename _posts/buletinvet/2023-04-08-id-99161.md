## Abstract:
"Newcastle disease virus is an oncolytic virus that has great potential as a cancer virotherapy because it can selectively infect and replicate in tumor cells. Virotherapy with ND virus can also stimulate the immune system, and lyse tumor cells with limited or non-pathogenic pathogenicity against mammals. The purpose of this study was to determine the side effects of virotherapy of the Newcastle disease virus, the virulent isolate Gianyar-1/AK/2014 on the kidneys by observing its histopathological picture. This study used a model of six fibrosarcoma rats which were randomly divided into two treatment groups where each treatment consisted of 3 rats as replicates. The non-therapeutic treatment (P0) was injected with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) and the therapeutic treatment (P1) was injected with the Newcastle Disease virus isolate Gianyar-1/AK/2014 virulent at a dose of 0.5 ml 28 units of HA. Renal histopathology at P0 and P1 showed necrotic, hemorrhagic, and congestion lesions. The severity of the kidney lesions was scored and then the data obtained were analyzed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. The results of this study found that necrotic lesions were milder in P1 rats compared to P0. As for hemorrhage and congestion, there was no significant difference between treated and untreated rats. Based on the results of this study, it can be interpreted that virotherapy of the Newcastle disease virus virulent isolate Gianyar-1/AK/2014 reduced necrotic lesions (p&lt;0.05), while for hemorrhagic and congestive lesions did not increase the severity of the lesions (p&gt;0.05) so that This shows that virotherapy with Newcastle disease virulent isolate Gianyar-1/ AK/ 2014 does not cause any adverse effects on the kidneys."
