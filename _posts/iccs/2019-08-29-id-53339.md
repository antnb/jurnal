However, how about the existence of ethnic or ethnic groups which are the wealth of the Indonesian people so that they do not disappear and later only the name remains, that is still a question for us, so in this paper the author discusses the sustainability of the ethnic groups in Indonesia. educational point of view.Ethnicity or ethnicity which is the wealth of the Indonesian people will be even stronger because it has been regulated in Law 20 of 2003 concerning the National Education System in its implementation as outlined in the culture and character-based curriculum and in clarification again with the enactment of the curriculum in 2013. Ethnic recognition has already been began to be formed through the path of basic education, secondary education to higher education.
