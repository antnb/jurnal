Community leaders hold an important role in decreasing the IR.This research aimed to explore the community leaders’ experiences in preventing dengue.This study was a qualitative research with a phenomenology approach. Participants of this study included five community leaders from Pererenan Village, Mengwi District, Badung Regency.Six themes assessed in this study included: 1) Inadequate knowledge of dengue vectors; 2) Perspectives in the prevention of dengue; 3) Low community participation; 4) The combination of prevention methods; 5) Inadequate coordination; and 6) Poor follow-up.Knowledge, participation, empowerment of the community, and the coordination between stakeholders including community, community leaders and health sectors holds an important role in the prevention of dengue."
