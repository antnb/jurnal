## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Seroprevalensi toksoplasmosis pada wanita di Bali tahun 2013 sebesar 63,9% dan seroprevalensi tertinggi wanita terinfeksi T. gondii berada di Kabupaten Gianyar sebesar 82,5%. Pada tahun 2016 Puskesmas Blahbatuh I memiliki kasus abortus yang paling tinggi di antara 13 Puskesmas yang ada di Kabupaten Gianyar yaitu sekitar 15,58%. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui hubungan tingkat pengetahuan dan sikap ibu hamil terhadap perilaku pencegahan toksoplasmosis di wilayah kerja Puskesmas Blahbatuh I tahun 2017. Jenis penelitian yang digunakan adalah cross sectional analitik. Sampel 75 ibu hamil yang dipilih dengan teknik probability sampling. Pengumpulan data meliputi pengetahuan, sikap, dan perilaku pencegahan menggunakan kuesioner dan dianalisis dengan menggunakan program komputer. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa sebanyak 20,0% responden memiliki perilaku pencegahan kurang, 52,0% responden memiliki pengetahuan kurang, dan 37,3% responden memiliki sikap kurang. Tidak terdapat hubungan yang signifikan antara tingkat pengetahuan terhadap perilaku pencegahan dengan nilai PR=2,167, dan terdapat hubungan yang signifikan antara sikap terhadap perilaku pencegahan dengan nilai PR=8,34. Jadi, di wilayah kerja Puskesmas Blahbatuh I dari 75 ibu hamil memiliki tingkat pengetahuan kurang, sikap kurang, dan perilaku pencegahan kurang. Tidak terdapat hubungan yang signifikan antara tingkat pengetahuan terhadap perilaku pencegahan dan terdapat hubungan yang siginfikan antara sikap terhadap perilaku pencegahan. Oleh karena itu Puskesmas Blahbatuh I harus meningkatkan pengetahuan dan sikap ibu hamil tentang toksoplasmosis dengan cara memberikan KIE pada saat pemeriksaan antenatal agar ibu hamil dapat melakukan pencegahan dengan baik. Kata kunci: Kehamilan, Toksoplasmosis, Pengetahuan, Sikap, Perilaku Pencegahan ABSTRACT Toxoplasmosis seroprevalence of women in Bali in 2013 was 63.9% and the highest seroprevalence of women infected with T. gondii was in Gianyar Regency by 82.5%. In 2016 Blahbatuh I Public Health Center had the highest abortion cases among 13 Community Health Centers in Gianyar Regency, which was around 15.58%. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of the level of knowledge and attitudes of pregnant women to the prevention of toxoplasmosis in the work area of ??Blahbatuh I Public Health Center in 2017. The type of research used was cross sectional analytic. Sample 75 pregnant women selected with probability sampling technique. Data collection includes knowledge, attitudes, and preventative behavior using a questionnaire and analyzed using a computer program. The results showed that as many as 20.0% of respondents had less preventive behavior, 52.0% of respondents had less knowledge, and 37.3% of respondents had less attitude. There is no significant relationship between the level of knowledge of preventive behavior with a PR value = 2.167, and there is a significant relationship between attitudes towards preventive behavior with a PR value of 8.34. So, in the working area of ??Blahbatuh I Public Health Center out of 75 pregnant women have less knowledge, less attitudes, and less preventive behavior. There is no significant relationship between the level of knowledge of preventive behavior and there is a significant relationship between attitudes towards preventive behavior. Therefore Puskesmas Blahbatuh I must improve the knowledge and attitudes of pregnant women about toxoplasmosis by providing IEC during antenatal examinations so that pregnant women can take preventative measures properly.
