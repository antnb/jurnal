## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Makanan adalah kebutuhan yang sangat penting bagi setiap manusia karena di dalam makanan terkandung zat gizi yang berguna untuk pertumbuhan dan perkembangan manusi. Potensi bahaya yang dapat mencemari atau mengkontaminasi makanan dapat berasal dari bahan (1) biologis berupa bakteri, virus, dan protozoa, (2) kimia berupa toksin bakteri, mikotoksin, cemaran logam berat, residu antimikroba, pengawet, pewarna dan pemanis buatan, pestisida dan (3) fisik berupa batu, rambut, serpihan kaca, potongan kayu, debu, tanah, dan lain lain. KLB keracunan makanan terjadi di beberapa desa/kelurahan di Kabupaten Gianyar. Tahun 2014 terjadi 3 KLB keracunan makanan, tahun 2015 terjadi 2 KLB keracunan makanan, tahun 2016 terjadi 2 KLB keracunan makanan. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui tingkat pengetahuan dan perilaku pencegahan kejadian keracunan makanan pada masyarakat di Desa Bukian, Kecamatan Payangan Kabupaten Gianyar. Selain itu, penelitian ini juga bertujuan untuk melihat ada atau tidaknya hubungan antara kedua variabel tersebut. Penelitian ini menggunakan rancangan cross sectional analitik yang dilaksanakan di Desa Bukian, Kecamatan Payangan, Kabupaten Gianyar. Responden dalam penelitian ini adalah salah satu perwakilan anggota keluarga pada setiap kepala keluarga (KK) yang berumur diatas atau sama dengan (?) 15 tahun sebanyak 106 orang yang terpilih menggunakan teknik Probability Proportional to Size (PPS). Data dikumpulkan menggunakan kuesioner yang dianalisis secara univariat dan bivariat. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa 58,49% masyarakat memiliki tingkat pengetahuan yang kurang mengenai keracunan makanan, 54,72% masyarakat memiliki perilaku pencegahan yang kurang mengenai keracunan makanan, ada pengaruh/hubungan yang bermakna antara tingkat pengetahuan dengan perilaku pencegahan kejadian keracunan makanan dengan nilai PR= 9,59 CI 95% = 3,75-24,5.Disarankan untuk memberikan penyuluhan atau sosialisasi yang merata tentang keracunan makanan oleh pemerintah ataupun institusi terkait dan penelitian lebih lanjut disarankan untuk melihat perilaku pencegahan keracunan makanan antara daerah yang mengalami KLB dan tidak mengalami KLB. Kata kunci: Keracunan Makanan, Tingkat Pengetahuan, Perilaku Pencegahan ABSTRACT Food is a very important requirement for every human being, because in the food contained nutrients that are useful for human growth and development. Potential hazards that can contaminate or contaminate food can come from (1) biological ingredients such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa, (2) chemicals in the form of bacterial toxins, mycotoxins, heavy metal contamination, antimicrobial residues, preservatives, artificial dyes and sweeteners, pesticides and (3) physical form of stone, hair, glass chips, pieces of wood, dust, soil, etc. Outbreaks of food poisoning occur in several villages in Gianyar Regency. In 2014 there were 3 outbreaks of food poisoning, in 2015 there were 2 outbreaks of food poisoning, in 2016 there were 2 outbreaks of food poisoning. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of knowledge and behavior to prevent food poisoning in the community in Bukian Village, Payangan District, Gianyar Regency. In addition, this study also aims to see whether or not there is a relationship between the two variables. This study used an analytic cross sectional design which was carried out in Bukian Village, Payangan District, Gianyar Regency. Respondents in this study were one representative of family members in each head of household (KK) aged over or equal to (?) 15 years as many as 106 people were selected using the Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) technique. Data were collected using a questionnaire that was analyzed univariately and bivariately. The results showed that 58.49% of the community had a lack of knowledge about food poisoning, 54.72% of the community had a lack of preventive behavior regarding food poisoning, there was a significant influence / relationship between the level of knowledge with the behavior of preventing food poisoning events with PR values = 9.59 CI 95% = 3.75-24.5. It is recommended to provide even outreach or socialization about food poisoning by the government or related institutions and further research is recommended to look at the behavior of food poisoning prevention between areas experiencing outbreaks and not experiencing an outbreak.
