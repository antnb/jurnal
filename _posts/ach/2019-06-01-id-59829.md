## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Campak merupakan salah satu dari penyakit menular yang dapat dicegah dengan imunisasi. Pada tahun 2016, diketemukan KLB campak di Pulau Nusa Penida, Kabupaten Klungkung. Secara geografis wilayah pulau Nusa Penida sendiri merupakan wilayah dengan daratan yang terpisah dengan pulau Bali, sehingga jika terjadi suatu kasus maka akan lebih mudah menyebar karena interaksi penduduk hanya sekitaran wilayah pulau tersebut. Padahal cakupan imunisasi dasar campak diwilayah tersebut pada tahun 2015 dan 2016 sudah melebihi target cakupan Nasional, yaitu 90%. Imunisasi campak seharusnya dapat memberikan kekebalan seumur terhadap serangan penyakit campak sehingga tidak menimbulkan KLB pada suatu wilayah. Tujuan penelitian ini untuk melihat gambaran status imunisasi, ketepatan pemberian imunisasi campak dan kejadian campak pada anak balita didaerah yang pernah mengalami KLB. Desain penelitian ini menggunakan rancangan deskriptif Cross Sectional. Sampel dalam penelitian ini adalah Anak Balita, dan yang menjadi responden adalah Ibu, dengan jumlah 70 sampel. Teknik pengambilan sampel pada penelitian ini yaitu Systematic Random Sampling. Hasil penelitian pada anak balita di daerah yang pernah mengalami KLB campak Nusa Penida, Kabupaten Klungkung menunjukkan bahwa 17,14% anak balita di daerah tersebut pernah mengalami campak. Berdasarkan status imunisasi, sebagian besar anak balita telah mendapatkan imunisasi dasar campak 74,29%, namun masih terdapat anak yang mengalami kejadian campak klinis dengan proporsi 3,85%. Sedangkan untuk ketepatan pemberian imunisasi, sebagian besar anak balita telah diberikan imunisasi dasar campak dengan tepat waktu yaitu usia 9-11 bulan 68,57%, namun masih terdapat anak balita yang mengalami kejadian campak klinis dengan proporsi 2,08%. Kejadian campak klinis pada anak balita lumayan tinggi, sangat perlu dilakukan konfirmasi uji laboratorium untuk memastikan kasus tersebut sehingga tepat dalam pengobatannya. Perlu adanya sosialisasi kepada masyarakat akan informasi mengenai pentingnya pemberian imunisasi yang harus diberikan tepat pada waktunya untuk mencegah terjadinya campak. Kata kunci: Status Imunisasi, Ketepatan Pemberian Imunisasi, Campak ABSTRACT One of the infectious diseases that can be prevented by immunization. In 2016, a measles outbreak was discovered on Nusa Penida Island, Klungkung Regency. Geographically, the island of Nusa Penida is an area with land separated from the island of Bali, so that if a case occurs it will be easier to spread because it deals with residents only around the island. Meanwhile, basic immunization seen in the region in 2015 and 2016 has exceeded the National achievement target of 90%. Immunization seems to provide immunity against disease that seems to affect outbreaks in a region. The purpose of this study was to see an overview of immunization status, accuracy of immunization and measles events in children under five years old who have experienced outbreaks. The design of this study used a cross sectional descriptive design. The sample in this study were toddlers, and the respondents were mothers, with a total of 70 samples. The sampling technique in this study is Systematic Random Sampling. The results of research on toddlers in areas that have used outbreaks of measles Nusa Penida, Klungkung Regency show that 17.14% of children under five in this area have experienced measles. Based on immunization status, most children under five have received basic measles immunization 74.29%, but still are children who have experienced clinical measles with a contribution of 3.85%. As for the accuracy of immunization, most children under five have been given basic immunization that looks right at the age of 9-11 months 68.57%, but still contains children under five who have clinical measles events with a proportion of 2.08%. Clinical incidence in children under five is high, it is necessary to conduct laboratory tests to ensure the case is right for treatment. There is a need for information dissemination to the public about the importance of immunization that must be given exactly when it has to be approved for release. Keywords: Immunization Status, Accuracy in Providing Immunizations, Measles"
