The design of this study was observational, with adesign cross sectional. The number of samples is 117 people. The sampling technique in this study used non probability sampling, which is a combination of snowballing and voluntary sampling which was conducted in Jembrana Regency in April-June 2021. The results showed that 77.78% complied with the application of health protocols and 22.22% did not comply. Variables of age, gender, income, last education and attitude have no relationship, age group 18-25 (p = 0.8941; OR = 1.14; 95%CI = 0.42-3.11), age group 26-45 (p= 0.8941;OR= 0.90; 95%CI=0.42-3.11), gender (p=0.2496,OR=1.68;95%CI:0.69-4.03 ), income (p=0.1574;OR=2.2;95%CI :0.69-4.03), last education (p= 0.6508; OR=1.26; 95%CI: 0.45- 3.50). The related variables were knowledge and public attitudes, knowledge (p=0.0032; OR=4.4;95% CI: 1.66-11.66), attitudes (p=&lt;0.001; OR=7, 27; 95%CI: 2.69-19.65). It can be concluded that there is a relationship between knowledge and attitudes towards compliance with the implementation of COVID-19 health protocols. It is recommended to mobilize cadres in each of the Neighborhood Associations to maximize IEC, information communication and education to the public regarding COVID-19 and the implementation of the COVID-19 health protocol which is carried out online.
