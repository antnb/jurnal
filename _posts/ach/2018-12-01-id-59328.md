## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Kanker serviks menempati urutan kedua di dunia setelah kanker payudara. Pada tahun 2016, kasus baru kanker serviks terbanyak di Bali ditemukan di Kota Denpasar sebanyak 834 kasus dan meninggal sebanyak 12 orang. Wanita Pekerja Seks berisiko untuk menderita kanker serviks karena sering berganti-ganti pasangan seksual dan berhubungan seksual pada usia dini. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui faktor pendorong dan penghambat Wanita Pekerja Seks (WPS) di Denpasar untuk melakukan Pap Smear/IVA sebagai upaya pencegahan kanker serviks tahun 2017. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian deskriptif kuantitatif dengan menggunakan metode cross-sectional. Jumlah sampel pada penelitian ini sebanyak 82 wanita pekerja seks langsung dengan menggunakan teknik quota sampling. Pengumpulan data dilakukan dengan menggunakan kuesioner dan data dianalisis secara univariat dan bivariat. Dari hasil penelitian ditemukan bahwa sebagian besar wanita pekerja seks langsung di Kota Denpasar berumur &lt; 35 tahun (74,4%), berpendidikan rendah (92,7%), dan berasal dari luar Bali (98,8%). Faktor pendorong wanita pekerja seks langsung untuk melakukan Pap Smear/IVA adalah faktor biaya Pap Smear terjangkau (64,6%) dan biaya IVA terjangkau (100%), serta akses ke fasilitas kesehatan dekat (68,3%). Faktor penghambat untuk melakukan pemeriksaan Pap Smear/IVA adalah pengetahuan kurang (79,3%), bersikap negatif (81,7%), tidak pernah mendapat sumber informasi (72%), fasilitas dan sarana kesehatan tidak tersedia (76,8%), tidak mendapat dukungan teman (85,4%) dan petugas kesehatan (73,2%). Penyebaran informasi tentang pencegahan kanker serviks yang lebih intensif dengan meningkatkan peran serta tenaga kesehatan diharapkan mampu menurunkan kejadian kanker serviks dan meningkatkan kemauan Wanita Pekerja Seks untuk melakukan pemeriksaan Pap Smear/IVA.
