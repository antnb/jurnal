## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Pelanggaran Pemberlakuan Pembatasan Kegiatan Masyarakat (PPKM) hingga saat ini masih terjadi. Banyak Coffee Shop tidak mengindahkan kebijakan PPKM sehingga berisiko meningkatkan penyebaran Covid-19. Tujuan penelitian untuk mengetahui persepsi pelaku usaha (Coffee Shop) terhadap PPKM di Kota Denpasar. Desain penelitian yaitu deskriptif kualitatif. Informan penelitian yaitu tujuh orang pelaku usaha (Coffee Shop) di mal dan luar mal di Kota Denpasar. Teknik pengumpulan data yaitu wawancara mendalam dan observasi. Teknik analisis menggunakan analisis tematik. Hasil penelitian yaitu pelaku usaha mempersepsikan Coffee Shop tidak rentan menjadi kluster Covid-19 dikarenakan sudah menerapkan pola hidup sehat dan protokol kesehatan. Persepsi manfaat, pelaksanaan PPKM tidak memberikan manfaat dari segi profit melainkan dari segi perilaku kesehatan masyarakat. Persepsi hambatan pelaksanaan PPKM lebih banyak dirasakan oleh Coffee Shop yang berdiri sendiri bukan di mal yaitu tidak adanya sosialisasi kebijakan secara langsung. Adapun dorongan dari pelaku usaha menerapkan PPKM yaitu mempertahankan keberlangsungan usaha dan membangun images positif. Penerapan PPKM di mal lebih baik daripada di luar mal karena sosialisasi dan monitoring langsung yang diberikan oleh pihak mal. Bagi dinas terkait agar melakukan sosialisasi terkait Covid-19 serta urgensi kebijakan PPKM dalam upaya kolaborasi penanggulangan Covid-19. Bagi pihak mal atau desa adat terkait agar melakukan monitoring dan evaluasi terkait pelaksanaan PPKM.
