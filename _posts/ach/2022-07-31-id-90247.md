## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK IMD adalah meletakkan bayi diatas dada atau perut ibu dan membiarkan bayi mencari puting susu ibu pada satu jam pertama kelahiran. Tujuan penelitian ini untuk menggambarkan implementasi kebijakan IMD di RSU Bhakti Rahayu. Desain penelitian adalah deskriptif kualitatif. Informan utama penelitian yaitu bidan pelaksana dan perawat Unit Bedah Sentral. Informan pendukung yaitu ibu hamil dan ibu bersalin. Pengumpulan data dengan wawancara mendalam dan observasi. Strategi keabsahan data menggunakan triangulasi sumber. Terdapat SOP sebagai petunjuk kerja unit pelaksana, monitoring dilakukan setiap persalinan dan pembagian tugas dilakukan secara situasional. Jumlah, kompetensi dan pelatihan Sumber Daya Manusia sudah terpenuhi, ketersediaan fasilitas sudah baik. SOP disampaikan saat pelatihan dan KIE mengenai IMD diberikan saat ANC. Bidan sudah memiliki sikap mendukung tetapi ditemukan kesalahpahaman tatalaksana IMD. Hambatan pelaksanaan IMD adalah tidak ada ruang observasi khusus persalinan SC, kondisi ibu dan bayi dengan tindak lanjut medis dan kurangnya dukungan suami mendampingi saat bersalin. Kesimpulannya adalah implementasi kebijakan IMD sudah berjalan sesuai SOP walaupun terdapat kesalahpahaman tatalaksana IMD dan hambatan pada pelaksanaannya. Peran rumah sakit dapat dimaksimalkan untuk mendukung implementasi IMD sesuai SOP yang berlaku, bagi peneliti selanjutnya agar memilih topik serupa terkait implementasi IMD di fasilitas kesehatan dengan metode yang berbeda. Kata kunci : Implementasi, IMD dan rumah sakit ABSTRACT EIB is placing the baby on the mother's chest or stomach and letting the baby look for the mother's nipple in the first hour of birth. The purpose of this study is to describe the implementation of the EIB policy at Bhakti Rahayu General Hospital. The research design is descriptive qualitative. The main informants of the study were midwives and nurses of the Central Surgical Unit. Supporting informants are pregnant women and mothers giving birth. Data collection by in-depth interviews and observations. The data validity strategy uses source triangulation. There are SOPs as work instructions for the implementing unit, monitoring is carried out every delivery and the division of tasks is carried out situationally. The number, competence and training of Human Resources have been met, the availability of facilities is good. The SOP was delivered during the training and information about EIB was given during the ANC. Midwives already have a supportive attitude but there are misunderstandings about the management of EIB. Barriers to the implementation of IMD are that there is no special observation room for cesarean delivery, the condition of the mother and baby with medical follow-up and the lack of husband support during delivery. The conclusion is that the implementation of the EIB policy has been running according to the SOP, although there are misunderstandings in the management of EIB and obstacles to its implementation. The role of the hospital can be maximized to support the implementation of EIB according to the applicable SOP, for further researchers to choose a similar topic related to the implementation of EIB in health facilities with different methods. Keywords : Implementation, Early Initiation of Breastfeeding (EIB), hospital"
