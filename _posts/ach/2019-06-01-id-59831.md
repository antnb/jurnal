## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Cakupan ASI Eksklusif pada tahun 2016 di Wilayah Kerja Puskesmas Abiansemal IV masih rendah yaitu 77%. Peran bidan praktik swasta sangat penting untuk keberhasilan dalam pemberian ASI Eksklusif. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui peran bidan praktek swasta dalam pemberian ASI Eksklusif di Wilayah Kerja Puskesmas Abiansemal IV Kecamatan Abiansemal Kabupaten Badung. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian kualitatif dengan teknik pengambilan sampel purposive sampling. Metode pengambilan data dilakukan dengan wawancara mendalam pada 8 orang informan yaitu ibu-ibu yang mempunyai bayi usia 0-24 bulan dan 4 orang informan kunci yaitu bidan praktik swasta. Selain itu dilakukan juga observasi di tempat bidan praktik swasta. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bidan praktik swasta memberikan informasi ASI Eksklusif pada saat antenatal care yaitu ketika kehamilan ibu memasuki trimester ketiga dan pemberian informasi ASI Eksklusif juga dilakukan ketika bayi lahir serta pada saat evaluasi perilaku pemberian ASI Eksklusif. Namun terdapat satu bidan praktik swasta yang menyediakan susu formula. Persepsi ibu terhadap peran bidan cukup baik karena menurut ibu, bidan praktik swasta memberikan pelayanan yang ramah, namun tidak semua mendapatkan perawatan payudara di bidan praktik swasta. Ibu yang mendapatkan informasi yang lengkap dari bidan memiliki pengetahuan yang baik terkait ASI Eksklusif. Meskipun pengetahuan ibu baik namun tidak memberikan ASI Eksklusif karena mengalami hambatan. Kesimpulan dari penelitian ini adalah bidan berperan cukup baik dalam pemberian informasi ASI Eksklusif yaitu pada saat kehamilan ibu memasuki trimester ketiga dan pada saat ibu sudah melahirkan bayi, pengetahuan ibu pada manfaat lebih baik dibandingkan dengan pengertian ASI Eksklusif, persepsi ibu terhadap peran bidan praktik swasta cukup baik, hanya satu orang ibu yang telah memberikan ASI Eksklusif. Saran yang dapat diberikan adalah kerjasama antara pihak puskesmas dan bidan praktik swasta lebih ditingkatkan terkait promosi ASI Eksklusif, Puskesmas Abiansemal IV dapat memberikan leaflet atau brosur terkait pemberian ASI Eksklusif kepada bidan praktik swasta serta penelitian ini dapat dijadikan sumber referensi untuk penelitian selanjutnya terkait alasan-alasan ibu tidak memberikan ASI Eksklusif. Kata kunci: Peran Bidan Praktik Swasta, Pengetahuan Ibu, Perilaku Ibu, Persepsi Ibu Terhadap Peran Bidan Praktik Swasta ABSTRACT Coverage of exclusive breastfeeding in 2016 in the working area of ??Abiansemal IV Puskesmas was still low at 77%. The role of private practice midwives is crucial for success in exclusive breastfeeding. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of private practice midwives in exclusive breastfeeding in the working area of ??Abiansemal IV Health Center, Abiansemal District, Badung Regency. This research is a qualitative research with purposive sampling technique. The data collection method was carried out by in-depth interviews with 8 informants namely mothers who have babies aged 0-24 months and 4 key informants namely private practice midwives. In addition, observations were also made at the private practice midwife's place. The results of this study indicate that private practice midwives provide information on exclusive breastfeeding during antenatal care, namely when the mother's pregnancy enters the third trimester and exclusive breastfeeding information is also performed when the baby is born and at the time of evaluating the behavior of exclusive breastfeeding. But there is one private practice midwife who provides formula milk. The mother's perception of the role of the midwife is quite good because according to the mother, the private practice midwife provides friendly service, but not all get breast care at the private practice midwife. Mothers who get complete information from midwives have good knowledge related to exclusive breastfeeding. Even though the mother's knowledge is good, she does not provide exclusive breastfeeding due to obstacles. The conclusion of this study is that midwives play a fairly good role in providing exclusive breastfeeding information, namely when the mother's pregnancy enters the third trimester and when the mother has given birth to a baby, the mother's knowledge of benefits is better than the understanding of exclusive breastfeeding, the mother's perception of the role of private practice midwife well, only one mother has given exclusive breastfeeding. Suggestions that can be given are cooperation between the puskesmas and private practice midwives to be improved in relation to the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, Abiansemal IV Puskesmas can provide leaflets or brochures related to exclusive breastfeeding to private practice midwives and this research can be used as a reference source for further research related to reasons mother does not give exclusive breastfeeding.
