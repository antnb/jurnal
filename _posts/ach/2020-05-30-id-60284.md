## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Kapasitas fungsi paru merupakan kesanggupan paru-paru dalam menampung udara didalamnya. Perajin batu paras yang bekerja di lingkungan yang terpapar debu dalam jangka panjangnya akan menimbulkan penyakit akibat kerja salah satunya berupa gangguan kapasitas fungsi paru. Tujuan penelitian ini untuk menganalisis hubungan antara faktor individu dan konsentrasi paparan debu dengan kapasitas fungsi paru pada perajin batu paras di Desa Ketewel, Sukawati, Gianyar. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian cross-sectional analitik. Responden penelitian ini adalah seluruh perajin batu paras yang ada di Desa Ketewel yang berjumlah 60 orang. Data dianalisis secara univariat, bivaraiat dengan uji Chi-square, dan multivariate dengan multiple logistic regression. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan sebanyak 56,67% perajin batu paras mengalami gangguan kapasitas fungsi paru. Faktor yang berhubungan secara signifikan dengan kapasitas fungsi paru adalah paparan debu (p=0, 04; OR=4,70; 95% CI 1,09-20,24). Disimpulkan bahwa paparan debu berhubungan signifikan dengan kapasitas fungsi paru perajin batu paras di Desa Ketewel. Disarankan kepada pemilik usaha batu paras bekerjasama dengan pihak kesehatan keselamatan kerja setempat dalam hal sosialisasi bahaya penyakit akibat kerja khususnya bahaya paparan debu. Kata Kunci: Paparan Debu, Perajin Batu Paras, Faktor Individu, Kapasitas Fungsi Paru ABSTRACT The pulmonary function capacity is the ability of the lungs to hold air in it. Paras stone Artisan who work in the environment which exposed to dust in the long run will cause work-related diseases, one of them is a disruption of lung function capacity.The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between individual factors and the concentration of dust exposure with lung function capacity in sandstone artisans in Ketewel Village. This study is an analytical cross-sectional study. The respondents of this study were all paras stone artisans in Ketewel Village, which numbered 60 people. Data were analyzed by univariate, bivariate with Chi-square test, and multivariate with multiple logistic regression. The results showed that 56.67% of paras stone artisans had pulmonary function capacity. Factors significantly associated with pulmonary function capacity were exposure to dust (p = 0, 04; OR = 4.70; 95% CI 1.09-20.24). It was concluded that dust exposure was significantly associated with pulmonary function capacity of paras stone artisans in Ketewel Village. It is recommended to the business owner of the sandstone to work with the local occupational health authorities in terms of socializing the dangers of occupational diseases, especially the danger of dust exposure. Key words: Paras Stone Artisan, Dust Exposure, Individual Factor, Pulmonary Function Capacity"
