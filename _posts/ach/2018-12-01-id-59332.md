## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Infeksi Menular Seksual (IMS) adalah infeksi yang penularannya terutama melalui hubungan seksual. Di Indonesia, jumlah kasus IMS pada tahun 2014 terjadi sebanyak 5608 kasus. Dinas Kesehatan Provinsi Bali mencatat jumlah pasien IMS yang ditemukan pada tahun 2013 sebanyak 9.202 orang. Jumlah ini meningkat sebanyak 62,17% pada tahun 2014 dan mengalami penurunan sebanyak 61,82% pada tahun 2015. Data yang diperoleh dari Dinas Kesehatan Kota Denpasar menunjukkan bahwa dari keseluruhan kasus di Kota Denpasar pada tahun 2016, kasus IMS tertinggi berada di wilayah Puskesmas II Denpasar Utara yaitu sebanyak 36,94 %. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui kejadian IMS berdasarkan karakteristik sosial demografi meliputi jenis penyakit, umur, jenis kelamin, pendidikan terakhir, status perkawinan, pekerjaan, kelompok risiko, pemakaian kondom dan jumlah pasangan seksual pada bagian IMS di Puskesmas II Denpasar Utara tahun 2014-2016. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian deskriptif dengan desain penelitian cross sectional retrospektif. Populasi dan sampel pada penelitian ini adalah seluruh pasien yang berkunjung ke Klinik IMS Puskesmas II Denpasar Utara periode tahun 2014-2016 yang diperoleh secara total sampling. Data sekunder yang diperoleh selanjutnya diolah secara statistik dengan menggunakan stata. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kejadian IMS lebih tinggi pada kelompok umur 41-50 sebanyak 25%, subjek laki-laki sebanyak 26,4%, tidak pernah sekolah sebanyak 12,5%, subjek dengan status kawin sebanyak 37,6%, pekerjaan berisiko sebanyak 25,5%, kelompok WPS sebanyak 60%, subjek yang kadang-kadang memakai kondom sebanyak 18,2% dan jumlah pasangan seksual &gt;1 sebanyak 39,4%. Kesimpulan dari penelitian ini adalah kejadian IMS di Puskesmas II Denpasar Utara tahun 2014-2016 yaitu 7,4%-13%. Kejadian IMS lebih tinggi pada kelompok umur 41-50 dengan pekerjaan berisiko, kelompok WPS dan jumlah pasangan seksual &gt;1. Tiga jenis IMS yang paling sering terjadi di Puskesmas II Denpasar Utara dalam 3 tahun terakhir yaitu Urethritis Non-GO disusul Servisitis dan Kandidiasis. Diharapkan sasaran dalam pelaksanaan program IMS tidak hanya bagi penderita namun juga bagi pasangannya dan tidak hanya menyasar kelompok risiko seperti WPS namun juga pelanggan PS.

Data obtained from the Denpasar City Health Office showed that of all cases in Denpasar City in 2016, the highest STI cases were in the Puskesmas area II North Denpasar as much as 36.94%.

This research is a descriptive study with a retrospective cross sectional research design.
