## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Kabupaten Tabanan memberlakukan peraturan kawasan tanpa rokok pada restoran, namun dalam penerapannya masih rendah. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui faktor-faktor yang memengaruhi kepatuhan penerapan KTR oleh pengelola dengan memerhatikan larangan merokok total pada restoran di Kabupaten Tabanan. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian analitik kuantitatif dengan rancangan crossectional. Sampel penelitian yaitu pengelola restoran yang berada di Kabupaten Tabanan. Besar sampel menggunakan total sampling dengan jumlah 110 restoran, dengan jumlah yang berpartisipasi 87 restoran (79% response rate). Data dianalisis dengan menggunakan regresi logistik. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kepatuhan restoran dalam menerapkan larangan merokok total sebesar 26,44%. Faktor yang memengaruhi kepatuhan penerapan KTR yaitu umur pengelola (OR=3,45; 95% CI: 1,10-10,84), pengetahuan pengelola (OR=3,56; 95% CI: 0,96-13,16), sikap pengelola (OR=2,45; 95% CI: 0,72-8,30), serta persepsi dampak bisnis pengelola (OR=4,62; 95% CI: 1,12-19,07) berpeluang meningkatkan kepatuhan KTR. Kepatuhan pengelola restoran di Kabupaten Tabanan terhadap penerapan larangan merokok total relatif rendah. Masih banyak terdapat indikator yang belum terpenuhi dalam implementasi kepatuhan restoran. Perlu adanya dukungan berbagai sektor dalam meningkatkan kepatuhan seperti pengelola, pengunjung, maupun pemerintah sebagai pembuat kebijakan. Kata Kunci: rokok, kepatuhan, KTR, restoran.
