## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Pneumonia merupakan bentuk terparah ISPA yang secara khusus menyerang paru-paru dan dapat menular dengan cepat. Pneumonia adalah penyakit yang disebabkan kuman pneumococcus, staphylococcus, streptococcus dan virus. Cakupan penemuan pneumonia di Kabupaten Gianyar 28,8% sehingga masih dibawah target nasional sebesar 80% dengan permasalahan yang dihadapi yaitu deteksi kasus yang masih rendah karena belum adanya pelatihan untuk pengelola program pengendalian penyakit pneumonia dan perilaku pengelola program pneumonia dalam praktik penemuan kasus pneumonia memiliki peranan yang sangat penting sehingga perlu digambarkan karakteristik pengelola program pengendalian penyakit pneumonia di puskesmas se-Kabupaten Gianyar. Desain crossectional bersifat deskriptif yang dilakukan untuk menggambarkan karakteristik pengelola program pengendalian penyakit pneumonia balita di 65 puskesmas pembantu yang ada di Kabupaten Gianyar. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan sebagian besar responden berumur &lt;40 tahun (60,0%) dengan seluruh responden berjenis kelamin perempuan yang berpendidikan terakhir D3 (100,0%). Selain itu, sebagian besar responden dalam penelitian tidak pernah mendapatkan pelatihan sebanyak (96,9%) akan tetapi sebagian besar responden memiliki pengetahuan, sikap dan praktik yang baik atau sesuai standar. Diperlukan pelatihan yang serta keaktifan dalam mengikuti pelatihan tersebut.
