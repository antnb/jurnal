## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Pelayanan Antenatal (ANC) adalah salah satu bentuk pelayanan kesehatan ibu yang bertujuan untuk menjaga kesehatan ibu hamil selama periode kehamilan. Kekhawatiran terhadap penularan Covid-19 menyebabkan penurunan akses ibu hamil terhadap ANC. Namun di Puskesmas Karangasem I, cakupan ANC pada masa pandemi justru dapat meningkat dibanding sebelum pandemi. Berdasarkan Teori Health Belief Model (HBM), perilaku seseorang dalam mengakses pelayanan kesehatan dipengaruhi oleh persepsi ancaman terhadap penyakit dan persepsi bahwa perilaku tertentu dapat mengatasi penyakit. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah mendeskripsikan persepsi ibu hamil dalam mengakses ANC di Puskesmas Karangasem I pada masa pandemi Covid-19. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian kualitatif deskriptif dengan pendekatan fenomenologi. Informan penelitian dipilih secara purposive sampling terdiri dari ibu hamil, suami ibu hamil, dan bidan Puskesmas Karangasem I. Data dikumpulkan dengan metode wawancara mendalam dan observasi. Validasi data melalui triangulasi sumber dan triangulasi metode.Hasil penelitian menunjukkan meskipun merasa rentan dan menganggap Covid-19 sebagai penyakit yang serius, kekhawatiran ibu hamil dengan kondisi janinnya mendorong ibu untuk tetap melakukan ANC selama pandemi dengan menerapkan protokol kesehatan. Ibu hamil juga menganggap manfaat yang diperoleh dari ANC lebih besar dari hambatan untuk ANC, serta disaat bersamaan ada kesadaran dari dirinya sendiri serta dukungan bidan yang memicu kunjungan antenatal pada masa pandemi. Kata kunci : Pelayanan Antenatal, Persepsi, Ibu Hamil, Pandemi Covid-19, Bali ABSTRACT Antenatal care (ANC) is a service provided for pregnant women to maintain their health during pregnancy. During Covid-19 pandemic, routine antenatal visit is one of risk factors for pregnant women contracting Covid-19. Concern over Covid-19 transmission has declining access of pregnant women to ANC. However, at The Public Health Center of Karangasem I, ANC coverage during Covid-19 pandemic has even increased. Based on The Health Belief Model Theory, health behavior is determined by perceptions about disease and particular practice will effective reducing the threat. The present study aims to describe the perceptions of pregnant women in accessing ANC during Covid-19 pandemic. The study conducted using qualitative design and phenomenological approach. The research informants are pregnant women, husband, and midwives chosen through purposive sampling. Data collected using in-depth interviews and observation. The data analyzed using thematic analysis. Data validation using data source triangulation and method triangulation. The result showed despite of feeling vulnerable and consider Covid-19 as a serious disease, the concerns of pregnant women over their fetus encourage them to access ANC by health protocols.
