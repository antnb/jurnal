## Abstract:
"ABSTRAKPuskesmas Kuta Utara merupakan salah satu puskesmas perkotaan di Kabupaten Badung yang memiliki proporsi tertinggi (18,8%) wanita usia subur positif tumor atau benjolan pada payudara. Hasil studi pendahuluan menunjukkan bahwa perilaku Periksa Payudara Sendiri (SADARI) pada wanita usia subur masih rendah. Tujuan penelitian untuk mengetahui determinan perilaku SADARI pada wanita usia subur di wilayah Puskesmas Kuta Utara. Penelitian analitik ini menggunakan pendekatan cross sectional yang dilakukan pada 62 sampel wanita usia subur melalui wawancara menggunakan kuesioner. Analisis data dilakukan secara univariat, bivariat (uji chi-square) dan multivariat (regresi logistik). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa sebagian besar (54,8%) wanita usia subur melakukan perilaku SADARI dengan baik. Hasil uji chi square menunjukkan bahwa pendidikan (RP= 2,563; p=0,003; 95%CI: 1,174-5,594), tingkat pengetahuan (RP=2,143; p=0,003; 95%CI: 1,208-3,801), dan dukungan sosial (RP= 1,812; p=0,033; 95%CI: 1,266-2,594) memiliki hubungan yang signifikan dengan perilaku SADARI pada wanita usia subur. Hasil analisis multivariat menunjukkan bahwa faktor yang berpengaruh terhadap perilaku SADARI adalah tingkat pengetahuan (AOR=6,107; p=0,003; 95%CI: 1,879-19,851) dan dukungan sosial (AOR=11,807; p=0,033; 95%CI: 1,216-114,683). Simpulan dari penelitian ini yaitu tingkat pengetahuan dan dukungan sosial merupakan faktor yang berpengaruh terhadap perilaku SADARI. Petugas kesehatan diharapkan dapat meningkatkan pemberian komunikasi, informasi, edukasi (KIE) dan dukungan peer group, khususnya bagi kelompok wanita usia subur yang memiliki perilaku SADARI yang masih rendah. Penelitian selanjutnya diharapkan dapat memperdalam penelitian ini dengan menggunakan berbagai variabel yang belum diteliti.Kata kunci: SADARI, Wanita Usia Subur, Kualitatif ABSTRACTKuta Utara Health Center is one of the health centers in urban areas of Badung Regency that has the highest proportion (18,8%) of women of childbearing age who have positive breast tumors or lumps.
