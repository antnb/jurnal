## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Kualitas tidur merupakan gambaran yang menjelaskan tentang kemampuan seseorang mempertahankan waktu tidur dan tidak adanya gangguan yang dialami selama periode tidur. Banyak faktor dapat mempengaruhi kualitas tidur diantaranya penyakit, kondisi lingkungan seperti kebisingan dan cahaya, latihan fisik dan kelelahan, stress psikologi, obat-obatan dan zat kimia diet dan kalori, serta konsumsi kopi. Tujuan dari penelitian ini untuk mengetahui faktor-faktor yang berhubungan dengan kualitas tidur mahasiswa yang mengonsumsi kopi di Fakultas Kedokteran Universitas Udayana. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian analitik dengan pendekatan kuantitatif menggunakan rancangan cross-sectional. Penentuan sampel pada penelitian menggunakan metode systematic random sampling dengan jumlah 118 responden. Hasil menunjukan proporsi mahasiswa dengan kualitas tidur buruk sebesar 50.85% dan kualitas tidur baik sebesar 49.15%. Variabel yang secara signifikan berhubungan dengan kualitas tidur mahasiswa yaitu jenis minuman kopi (OR=2.22; 95% CI=1.122-4.418; p=0.022) dan kelelahan psikis (OR=3.84; 95% CI=1.509-9.777; p=0.005). Dapat disimpulkan terdapat hubungan antara jenis minuman kopi yang dikonsumsi mahasiswa dan faktor kelelahan psikis dengan kualitas tidur mahasiswa yang mengonsumsi kopi di Fakultas Kedokteran Universitas Udayana. Diharapkan untuk melakukan penelitian terkait dosis kafein pada jenis minuman kopi espresso, americano, cappuccino, dan latte serta meneliti faktor-faktor penyebab kelelahan psikis pada mahasiswa kedokteran yang kaitannya dengan kualitas tidur yang dialami mahasiswa. Kata kunci: Kualitas Tidur, Konsumsi Kopi, Mahasiswa ABSTRACT Sleep quality is a picture that explains about a person's ability to maintain sleep time and the absence of disturbances experienced during sleep periods. Many factors can affect sleep quality including diseases, environmental conditions such as noise and light, physical exercise and fatigue, psychological stress, drugs and chemicals, diet and calories, and coffee consumption. The purpose of this study was to determine factors related to sleep quality of students who consume coffee at the Faculty of Medicine, Udayana University. This research is an analytical study with a quantitative approach using a cross-sectional design. Determination of the sample in this study using systematic random sampling method with a total of 118 respondents. The results show the proportion of students with poor sleep quality by 50.85% and good sleep quality by 49.15%. Variables that were significantly related to student sleep quality were types of coffee drinks (OR = 2.22; 95% CI = 1,122-4,418; p = 0.022) and psychological fatigue (OR = 3.84; 95% CI = 1.509-9777; p = 0.005) . It can be concluded that there is a relationship between the types of coffee drinks consumed by students and psychological fatigue factors with the sleep quality of students who consume coffee at the Faculty of Medicine, Udayana University. It is expected to conduct research related to the dose of caffeine in the types of espresso, americano, cappuccino, and latte coffee drinks and examine the factors that cause psychological fatigue in medical students related to sleep quality experienced by students. Keywords: Sleep Quality, Coffee Consumption, Students"
