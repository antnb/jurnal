Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian kuantitatif dengan jumlah sampel 193 pasien rawat jalan, penelitian ini menggunakan desain cross-sectional. Hasil analisis menunjukkan terdapat hubungan mutu pelayanan kehandalan (p=0,003) dan bukti fisik (p=0,00) dengan minat kunjungan ulang pasien rawat jalan. Sedangkan karakteristik responden seperti umur (p=0,39), jenis kelamin (p=0,23), pendidikan (p=0,38), pekerjaan (p=0,30), dan variabel persepsi tentang mutu pelayanan daya tanggap (p=0,06), jaminan (p=0,38), serta empati (p=0,112) tidak memiliki hubungan dengan minat kunjungan ulang pasien rawat jalan.
