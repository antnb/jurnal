## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Pemberian ASI secara eksklusif adalah pemberian ASI tanpa makanan dan minuman tambahan lain pada bayi berumur nol sampai enam bulan. Kurangnya pengetahuan tentang manfaat ASI, gencarnya promosi susu formula serta banyak ibu menyusui yang meninggalkan bayi mereka untuk bekerja menyebabkan tingkat pemberian ASI Eksklusif rendah. Tujuan penelitian untuk mengetahui persepsi ibu menyusui tentang pemberian ASI Eksklusif bagi ibu bekerja. Data yang digunakan adalah data primer, jenis penelitian yg digunakan adalah deskriptif. Penelitian dilakukan di semua posyandu yang ada di wilayah Puskesmas Tabanan II yang memiliki bayi yang lahir di bulan Maret – September 2022.

Karakteristik responden yaitu mayoritas berumur 20 – 35 tahun, pendidikan terakhir SMA/SMK, bekerja &gt; 8 jam sehari, adanya dukungan suami dan keluarga terhadap pemberian ASI dan pengetahuan yang cukup tentang pemberian ASI Eksklusif untuk ibu bekerja. Identifikasi persepsi positif diperoleh dari ibu berumur 20-35 tahun, pendidikan tinggi, ibu bekerja &gt;8 jam, suami dan keluarga mendukung, serta pengetahuan cukup dalam pemberian ASI. Kesimpulan pada penelitian ini sebagian besar responden memiliki persepsi positif terhadap pemberian ASI eksklusif. Kata Kunci: Persepsi, ASI Eksklusif. ABSTRACK Exclusive breastfeeding is breastfeeding without other additional food and drinks for infants aged zero to six months. Lack of knowledge about the benefits of breastfeeding, intensive promotion of formula milk and many breastfeeding mothers leaving their babies to work have caused the rate of exclusive breastfeeding low. The aim of the study was to determine the perceptions of breastfeeding mothers about exclusive breastfeeding for working mothers. The data used is primary data, the type of research used is descriptive. The research was conducted at all Posyandu in the Tabanan II Health Center area which had babies born in March - September 2022. The study sample was 58 people using total sampling.
