The relationship between these parties put contractor as the chain in this relationship, known as construction supply chain (CSC). In CSC there are possibilities of risks that can increase the project cost, thus impact on the declining of the contractor’s profit. These source from three flows of supply chain system, that is flow of informations, flow of material and flow of funds. This research aims to analysis the supply chain risks on building construction project in Bali that affect on the declining of contractor’s profit. Data was collected using a questionnaire survey. The respondents were selected based on purposive sampling method, covers the experst on building construction projects. The method of analisys covers risk assement and linear regression analysis.
