As one of the main street in Denpasar city, this street can represent the characteristics of Denpasar city which is the Car Free Day was held in in every Sunday morning in this street, as a simple way to reduce the air pollution and noise. The calculation in this journal is road performance, air pollution and noise level for 2 condition that is in Car Free Day and in working day. From the calculation result of road performance, the capacity of the street is 4.110 pcu/hour with degree of saturation is 0,8. The level of street service is on D category where the flow is almost unstable with high volume of traffic. The traffic volume is mostly reached the capacity and delay is frequently occur in this street. The measurement process of the level of air pollution showed that from six parameter which tested were over all are still under the standard quality which is allowed as good and medium category.
