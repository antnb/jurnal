Selection of the sample with purposive sampling method and acquired 36 companies with a number of observations over 14 years. Data analysis technique used is path analysis. These results indicate that, if high corporate rentability, the company tends to pay dividends and vice versa. Bonus issue itself was published at a time when companies do not have the capability sufficient cash to pay dividends, and the company will choose a stock option bonus as a successor or the company entered into a plan of dividend reinvestment plans (DRP) which allows investors to reinvest the dividends they have received returned to the company as additional capital for the company and instead investors receive bonus shares of the company.
