The population in this study are banks in the category of Commercial Banks Business Group 3 registered with the OJK during the 2016 - 2020 period with a total sample of 10 banks which were taken using the purposive sampling method. The analysis technique used is multiple linear regression analysis. The results showed that financial inclusion and economic growth had a significant negative effect on bank credit risk.
