The duration of migration has a negative and significant effect on the distance of women traders migration. Ethnic and longevity of marriage have no significant effect on migration distance of female migrant traders. The level of education, age, ethnicity, number of dependents and migration spacing have a positive and significant impact on the income of female migrant traders.
