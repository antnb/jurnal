As for data analysis techniques using Partial Least Square – Structural Equation Modelling (PLS – SEM). Based on the results of the research, it can be concluded that the participation of managers in strategic planning significantly positively affects the fairness of perception and autonomous budget motivation perceived by middle-level managers and can reduce the budget gaps that occur in the organization."
