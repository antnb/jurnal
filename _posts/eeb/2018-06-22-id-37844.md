Empowerment positively affects employees' professional commitment. Empowerment mediates the effect of job stress on employee professional commitment and mediates the impact of work-family conflicts on employee professional commitments. Suggestions for recommended companies are required to act with integrity, through consistency by choosing and placing employees according to their ability and knowledge to avoid work conflicts.
