But there is also non mandatory auditor switching which usually can result from the issuance of the auditor's going concern opinion.

Hypothesis testing is performed using binary logistic regression. The results showed the issuance of going concern opinion has a positive effect on the possibility of auditor switching. Timeliness of financial reporting and the audit committee did not moderate the effect of the issuance of a going concern opinion on the possibility of a auditor switching. The results also show the interaction of the issuance of going concern opinion, timeliness of financial reporting and audit committee has no effect on the possibility the company were switch auditors.
