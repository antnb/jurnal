"Financial and Development Supervisory Board’s audit quality reflects the effectiveness of internal controls in providing assurance to increase governance accountability and transparency. This study aims to obtain empirical evidence of integrity as a moderating in the influence of time budget pressure, task complexity, and work experience on audit quality.

The analyzed data is primary data. The data is obtained using a questionnaire. Furthermore, research hypotheses were tested with Moderated Regression Analysis. Hypothesis testing results show that integrity is not a moderating variable in the influence of time budget pressure on audit quality.

In addition, integrity is not a moderating variable in the influence of work experience on audit quality."
