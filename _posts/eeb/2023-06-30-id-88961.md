The existence of the banking sector has an important role, where in people's lives most of them involve services from the banking sector.

This research was conducted with the aim of knowing the effect of the Capital Adequacy Ratio, Operating Costs on Operating Income, Non-Performing Loans on the Profitability of Commercial Banks listed on the IDX in 2016-2020. The data used in this study is secondary data, namely by looking at the annual financial statements of commercial banks listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2016-2020 which can be accessed through the website www.idx.co.id. This study uses the method of determining the sample using purposive sampling. The sample used in this study was 145 data on commercial banks listed on the IDX.
