Collecting data in this study using a questionnaire. The analysis technique used in this research is descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing using moderate regression analysis techniques. The conclusion of this study is that Tri Kaya parisudha does not moderate the effect of the implementation of self-assessment system on taxpayer compliance.
