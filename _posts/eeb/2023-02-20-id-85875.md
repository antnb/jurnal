The results of the analysis and discussion of the study found that NPL and BOPO had a negative and significant effect on ROA, CAR had a positive and significant effect on ROA, NPL had a positive and insignificant effect on CAR, BOPO had a negative and significant effect on CAR, CAR was unable to mediate the effect of NPL on ROA, and CAR is able to mediate the effect of BOPO on ROA. Good management of NPL, BOPO, and CAR will bring maximum profitability, so that the bank's financial performance will be better."
