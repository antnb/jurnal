Demographic factors in this study represented by age, gender, and the length of work experience. Psychological factors represented by personality-job fit and psychological capital. Total sampel are 384 account representatives who were willing to fill out the research questionnaires distributed online. The data were analyzed using multiple linear regressions. The analysis shows that age, the length of work experience, personality-job fit, and the psychological capital have a positive effect on the performance of the account representatives, while the gender does not affect the performance of account representatiives. The results of this study could be used by the Directorate General of Taxes as a reference in the placement and development of its account representatives."
