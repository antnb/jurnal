The result of this research is that Shopee is e-commerce with the biggest enthusiasts in Bali. E-price and e-trust have a positive and significant effect on e-loyalty, and e-price has a positive and significant effect on e-trust, e-trust can mediate the effect of e-price on e-loyalty. This research is expected to be able to provide input to further researchers, e-commerce providers, sellers who sell in e-commerce, and customers.
