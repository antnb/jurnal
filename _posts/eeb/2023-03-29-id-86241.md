The results showed that workload had a significant negative effect on work morale, workload had a significant positive effect on work stress and stress had a significant negative effect on work morale. Another finding is that work stress is not a mediator of the relationship between workload and the morale of nurses at Wangaya Hospital Denpasar. Practically, the findings of this study can be used by hospital managers to maintain the work of nurses through the provision of work morale in accordance with abilities and regulations. In addition, hospital managers should avoid making policies that can create work stress by testing new rules."
