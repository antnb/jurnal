"This study aims to analyze the effect of education level, age, family income, and number of dependents simultaneously and partially on the work participation of the elderly in Buleleng Regency, as well as to determine whether the number of dependents plays a role in moderating the effect of family income on the work participation of the elderly population in Buleleng Regency. The method of determining the sample in this study used non-probability sampling with accidental sampling and purposive sampling with a sample size of 100 people. The data analysis technique used is the interaction test or Moderated Regression Analysis (MRA).
