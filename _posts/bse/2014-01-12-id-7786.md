The analysis used is qualitative descriptive analysis and SWOT analysis. Analytical results from this study can be described as follows: (1) analysis of the indicator variable quality of human resources (HR) provides results of several indicators that are analyzed, showing the quality of human resources related to living conditions itself, and (2) SWOT analysis carried out showed that the results of the village Batukandik have different strengths that can be utilized in an effort to alleviate poverty.
