The data analysis used in this research is descriptive qualitative analysis, which is research that aims to accurately describe the properties of an object, condition, symptom or group to determine the frequency of the relationship or influence between a symptom and other symptoms in society. Its purpose is to create a systematic picture. Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that the community states the importance of the existence of microfinance institutions to improve the community's economy and requires experienced, properly educated and honest managers.
