## Abstract:
"Inter-provincial young migrants in Indonesia who have a working status reach 49.29%. This means that nearly half of the total inter-provincial young migrants who enter the workforce. This number is relatively high, and will become a problem when these young migrants drop out of school to work for various reasons. It aims to determine the influence and tendency of individual factors and contextual factors in decision making to work for inter-provincial young migrants in Indonesia. With multilevel binary logistic regression, individual and contextual factors that significantly influence young migrant work decisions include gender, household status, school status, reasons for moving, and education level, dependency ratio and percentage of formal workers. There is a greater tendency to work for young male migrants, have status as the head of the household, are not in school anymore, the reason for moving is related to work, and their last education is higher education. Then, the tendency to work increases with the increase in dependency ratio and the percentage of formal workers in each province."
