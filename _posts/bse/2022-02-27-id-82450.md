The results of this study indicate that board of commissioners has positive and significant, independent commissioner has positive and not significant, institutional ownership has negative and not significant, managerial ownership has negative and not significant, family duality has negative and not significant influence before and during the pandemic Covid-19 and there are no differences in corporate governance mechanisms that have the most significant influence on hedging decisions before and during pandemic Covid-19."
