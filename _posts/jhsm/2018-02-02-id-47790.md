The results of examination of larvae density were known to the ovitrap index in Denpasar (4.4), Tabanan (6.6), Gianyar (8.9). There is evidence of transovarial transmission from female mosquitoes to eggs using Immunocytochemical Technique known to its transovarial index of each city ie Denpasar (11%), Gianyar (7.14%) and Tabanan (7.14%).
