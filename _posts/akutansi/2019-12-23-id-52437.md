This research is an event study with a window of events for 5 days. The study was conducted on PROPER participating companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2015 to 2017. The number of samples that met the criteria were 39 companies. PROPER announcements are measured using abnormal returns.

The test results show that the PROPER announcement was reacted negatively by the capital market, and there was no difference in market reaction between good ratings and bad ratings.
