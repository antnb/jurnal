## Abstract:
"The success of an accounting information system in managing regional finances of government agencies is very important to note. Especially if there is a phenomenon of switching from one system to another. The success or failure of the system used can have an impact on employee performance.

This study uses non-probability sampling method with saturated sample technique. The analysis technique used is partial least square analysis. The results of the analysis found that there was a significant influence between the variables of information quality on system use, information quality on user satisfaction, system use on individual performance, and user satisfaction on individual performance.
