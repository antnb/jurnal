The method of determining the sample in this study used purposive sampling to obtain 30 samples of companies that experienced upgrades or downgrades. Hypothesis testing uses the One Sample T Test. The conclusion of this study is that the bond issuing company carries out earnings management that increases profits after the bond rating has undergone an upgrade or a downgrade.Keywords: Earnings Management, Bond Ratings, Discretionary Accruals"
