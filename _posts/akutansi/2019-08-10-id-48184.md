## Abstract:
"OJK issues POJK No.29 / POJK.04 / 2016 which requires MD &amp; A disclosure in the annual report. The purpose of this study is to prove empirically that there are (1) market reactions in annual report disclosures, (2) the effect of MD &amp; A disclosure level on abnormal returns. The study population used the KOMPAS100 index of 100 issuers with a total sample of 63 samples. The Wilcoxon statistical test results state that there are differences before and after the disclosure of the annual report. Furthermore, a simple linear regression test was conducted which gave the results that the MD &amp; A disclosure had a positive effect on the market reaction that was proxied using abnormal return. The test results produce MD &amp; A disclosures that have a positive effect on market reactions through abnormal returns so that the market is known to use the information contained in MD &amp; A.Keywords : Management discussion and analysis, abnormal return, annual report."
