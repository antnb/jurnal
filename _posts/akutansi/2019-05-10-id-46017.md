The data analysis technique was simple linear regression. It was found that EVA and FVA as proxies of value added outperformed earnings. EVA is also found to be more associated with stock returns compared to FVA. The theoretical implication is in addition to references to further research regarding company performance measurement and stock returns. The practical implications is a matter of consideration for investors to make investment decisions and reference for corporate in financial decision making according to preferences of shareholders.
