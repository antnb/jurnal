## Abstract:
"The firms go public conduct Initial Public Offering (IPO) and set price of its shares with underwriters. Underpricing phenomenon that occurs when IPO is influenced by several factors. This study aims to determine the effect Return On Assets (ROA), firm size, underwriter reputation, auditor reputation, firm age, and financial industry type to the IPO underpricing. Total population of firmsIPO in 2009-2013 are 115 firms and obtained 90 samples, with a purposive sampling method. The analysis technique is multiple linear regression analysis with SPSS. The results showed that only auditor reputation negatively affects underpricing. Underwriter reputation negatively affects underpricing but the research hypothesis was rejected because different direction. ROA, firm size, firm age and financial industry type have no effect on underpricing. This suggests that non-financial information especially auditor reputation affects underpricing because investors believe that audited financial statements have informed the company as a whole."
