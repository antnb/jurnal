Based on the results of the analysis obtained a modern tax administration system, service quality, and awareness of taxpayers have a positive and significant effect on WPOP compliance.

Service quality also has a positive effect on WPOP compliance, this proves that the better the quality of services provided will make the taxpayer more compliant in fulfilling his obligations.
