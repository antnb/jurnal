In this study, earnings management is proxied by Modified Jones model and tested using the independent sample t-test. Meanwhile, the market response is proxied by commulative abnormal return and tested using paired sample t-test. Results of the study found that the case earnings management by increasing profits occured at the end of CEO tenure. Then, this study obtained results that there is no difference in market response around the event of CEO turnover."
