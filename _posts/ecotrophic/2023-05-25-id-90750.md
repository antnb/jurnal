## Abstract:
"Global warming and biodiversity loss are critical issues, and forest retention and reforestation programs are crucial in mitigating climate change. However, discussions around these programs often exclude the role of urban vegetation in carbon sequestration. Preserving urban vegetation, such as trees, can also significantly reduce carbon emissions. Urban vegetation can be found in two main locations: Urban Green Open Spaces (UGS) and Road Landscapes (RL). In Denpasar Bali, Glodokan Tiang or Polyalthia longifolia trees are planted at those locations. Data management and carbon stock calculation mechanisms are required to demonstrate the contribution of urban vegetation in terms of carbon sequestration. The technology of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can be used as an alternative to efficiently calculate the estimated carbon stock. The calculation uses the Diameter Breast High (DBH) value approach using the canopy area and Canopy Height Model (CHM) obtained from UAV data processing using the Sfm method. UAV estimates show that the highest Above Ground Biomass (AGB) value at Bajra Sandhi Renon Field is 201.59 kg with a stored carbon content of 94.75 kg, while on I Gusti Ngurah Rai Bypass has the highest AGB value of 215.04 kg with a stored carbon content of 101.07 kg. These results have been validated by field observations, where the results of the regression analysis at the location of Bajra Sandhi Renon and I Gusti Ngurah Rai, show that between field observation data and estimation data with UAV there is no significant difference. While the results of the t-test: Paired Two Sample for Means at the Bajra Sandhi Renon Field and the Bypass I Gusti Ngurah Rai have a value above the significance level which proves that there is no significant difference between the carbon stock value from field observations and the carbon stock from the UAV approach.
