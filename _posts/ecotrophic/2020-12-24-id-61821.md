"Taman Wisata Alam (TWA) Danau Buyan-Danau Tamblingan one of the forest ecosystems that are rich in biodiversity. The information about carbon stocks stored at the surface of the soil is very important to know in order to improvements can be made to the cultivation technique, plant type selection, and right forest management to maintain and increase carbon stocks. The study aimed: calculating and knowing the factors behind the difference carbon stocks above ground level, litter, and soil at Buyan Lake forest and Tamblingan Lake forest and formulating management strategy of TWA Danau Buyan-Danau Tamblingan for supports increased forest carbon stocks. Whereases the measurements carbon stock at medium, low and high density. To formulate management directives used the SWOT analysis.
