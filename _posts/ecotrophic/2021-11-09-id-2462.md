## Abstract:
"The study about determination of Pb and Cr content in nile fishes (Oreochromis niloticus) found atEstuaria Dam (Badung River Downtream) has been carried out. Some samples were taken every week duringhalf a month. Five grams of dried sample was destructed with a mixture of 10 mL concentrated H2SO4 and40 mL concentrated HNO3. The composition of Pb and Cr in the samples was analyzed Atomic AbsorptionSpectrofotometer using Standar Addition Method.The results showed that the content of Pb in the nile fishes was about 10.1910-10.7710 mg/kg wetsamples and it was over the maximum level of 2.0 mg/kg. On the other hand, the content of Cr wasfound(1.3460-2.9640 mg/kg wet samples) to be out of level as well (maximum 0.4 mg/kg)."
