"The research was done in surrounding Telagawaja River at Muncan Village, Karangasem Regency, Bali at October2008. The aim of the research was to know the air quality condition in that area. There were six air quality parametersmeasured at three different sites. The content of NO2 at the air varied 24,29-31,87 ?g/m3 was higher than that in GunaksaBeach where there are no activities at all but it was lower than that in Sawangan Nusa Dua where full of tourismactivities. The level of SO2 at the range of 34,44-44,97 ?g/m3 was lower than that in Padangbai Harbour where full ofhuman activities and transportations. The content of dust at the range of 105,82 ?g/m3, CO at the range of 497,78-568,89?g/m3, Pb at the range of 0,250-0,792 ?g/m3. The level of noise at the range of 40,33-53,79 dB(A) was lower than that invillage community at Kubu, Karangasem Regency and also lower than that in Sawangan Beach of Nusa Dua. All the airquality parameters are not yet over than standard of safe air quality level."
