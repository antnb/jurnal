## Abstract:
"Rice crop is one of the important commodities that must always be available, so estimation of rice production becomes very important to do before harvesting time to know the food availability. The technology that can be used is remote sensing technology using Landsat 8 Satellite. The aims of this study were (1) to obtain the model of estimation of rice production with Landsat 8 image analysis, and (2) to know the accuracy of the model that obtained by Landsat 8. The research area is located in three sub-districts in Klungkung regency. Analysis in this research was conducted by single band analysis and analysis of vegetation index of satellite image of Landsat 8. Estimation model of rice production was developed by finding the relationship between satellite image data and rice production data. The final stage is the accuracy test of the rice production estimation model, with t test and regression analysis. The results showed: (1) estimation of rice production can be calculated between 67 to 77 days after planting; (2) there was a positive correlation between NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) vegetation index value with rice yield; (3) the model of rice production estimation is y = 2.0442e1.8787x (x is NDVI value of Landsat 8 and y is rice production); (4) The results of the model accuracy test showed that the obtained model is suitable to predict rice production with accuracy level is 89.29% and standard error of production estimation is + 0.443 ton/ha. Based on research results, it can be concluded that Landsat 8 Satellite image can be used to estimate rice production and the accuracy level is 89.29%. The results are expected to be a reference in estimating rice production in Klungkung Regency."
