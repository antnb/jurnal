What is the condition of the community’s participation from thebeginning up to now does not yet have clear position in the form of authority and obligationand the right as community in making their participation in running the government is put intoa study. The method employed for the study is library research by using secondary datacoming from literatures, mass media, the specifications of legislations; comperative study wasalso made from various opinions and the understanding of community’s participation. Anumber of variables to be studied among others are: the specification of legislation, role ofgovernment, form of interaction of the implementation of community’s participation, andefforts made by the government within the context of community’s participation so thatdevelopment can be increased.
