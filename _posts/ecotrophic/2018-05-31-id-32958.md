## Abstract:
"Land use changes over Jakarta caused by urbanization affected the increasing of infrastructure and decreasing vegetation from 2003 to 2016. This condition reduced water infiltration and caused inundation when heavy rainfall coming. Then Aedes aegypti would breed.and increased which brought dengue fever desease. This study was about analyzing the land use change in Jakarta Province using Landsat image, and its relationship with land surface temperature and dengue fever distribution. The effects of land use change also analysed by this study which including the effects from temperature and dengue fever that analysed by indices of land use in Jakarta at 2003 and 2016. The temperature analysis could be obtained by TIR band in Landsat and using some algortitma which calculated in band math of ENVI software. Vegetation index value’s average decreased from 0.652 in 2003 to 0.647 2016 in 2016. Built up index value’s average increased from -0.03 in 2003 to -0.02 in 2016. While Bareland index value’s average decreased from 0.16 in 2003 to -0.46 in 2016. Land surface temperature increased 3?C from 2003 to 2016. Vegetation area decreased 27.929 ha, bare land area decreased 6.012 ha, while built up area increased 34.278 ha from 2003 to 2016. Increasing of land surface temperature proportional to increasing dengue fever patients 1.187 patients. Increasing of land surface temperature increasing dengue fever cases 1.187 patients. To review and monitor more about the relationship between landuse changes and temperature changes required image with high resolution so that the results obtained more accurate. Complete data of dengue fever per subdistricts also required to analyse further more about relationship between landuse changes, temperature changes, and dengue fever."
