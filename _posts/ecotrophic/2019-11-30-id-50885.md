These small-scale restaurants generate waste everyday and the waste is still managed with end of pipe practice where waste was hauled from collection point to disposal site without any intermediate treatment. Community based waste management with 3R (reduce, reuse, recycle) approach should be proposed to reduce waste at source. 3R Solid Waste Treatment Facilities (TPS 3R) is a facility that focused on reducing, reusing, and recycling waste at source comunally involved active roles from community and goverment. The objectives of this study are (1) Examining level of participation of small-scale restaurant owners if TPS 3R is built and implemented in Babakan.

The results showed most of small-scale restaurant owners are willing to participate in both sorting waste at source and paying TPS 3R service if TPS 3R is being implemented in Babakan. Average WTP values for TPS 3R is Rp 32,037.04/month and it’s higher than existing rate of waste collection service, which shows small-scale restaurant owners have preference for TPS 3R.
