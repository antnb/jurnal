## Abstract:
"This study conducted to determine the optimal concentration of galangal rhizome extract(Alpinia galanga) for inhibiting the growth of A. flavus in peanuts. The concentration of Alpiniagalanga extract used in this study were 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.4%. In this study using a descriptiveanalysis and displaying the results of the research presented in images and tables. While quantitativedata were also analyzed by the method of completely randomized design (CRD) analyzed by analysisof variance and continued with different test by Least Significant Difference test (LSD 5%).The results showed that the crude extract of (Alpinia galanga) had the ability to inhibit thegrowth of A. flavus, with very strong categorized on PDA. At a concentration of 0.4% did not findany growth of A. flavus, whereas the largest population grows at a concentration of Alpinia galangaekstract 0.0% (without the exstract Alpinia galanga) that was 121.33 x 103 cfu / g. At a concentrationof 0.4% was also able to inhibit the growth of A. flavus that contaminate peanuts with the inhibition ofup to 100%."
