## Abstract:
"The aims of this research are to determine the effects of comparison between the amount ofsticky rice flour with aloe on the characteristics of dodol and to find the right comparison between theamount of sticky rice flour and aloe to produce dodol with the best characteristics. The research designused is randomized group design with comparison between the amount of sticky rice flour and aloerespectively as follows: 100%: 0%, 85%:15%, 70%:30%, 55%:45%, and 40%:60%. The result wasrepeated three times producing 15 units of the experiment and the data was analyzed by varianceanalysis. If there was impact on the research, the analysis will be followed by Duncan’s test.The result of the research showed that comparison between the amount of sticky rice flour andaloe had significance effects on the content of water, dust, fat, protein, total sugar, antioxydantcapacity, colour, aroma, taste, texture and overall acceptance. The best characteristics of dodol aloewas found on comparison between 40% sticky rice flour and 60% for aloe with the folowing criteria :water content 17,89%, ast content 0,53%, 11, 47%, fat content, protein content 7,34%, total sugar45,80%, power antioxydant 50, 62%, texture elastic and overall acceptance is like.Keyword : sticky rice flour, aloe, dodol."
