## Abstract:
"The aim of this research is to determine the effect of comparison between amount of stickyrice flour and tamarillo on the characteristics of dodol and to know the right comparison betweenamount of sticky rice flour and tamarillo to produce dodol with the best characteristics. The researchdesign with used is randomized group design with comparisons between the amount of sticky riceflour and tamarillo were: 100%:0%, 85%:15%, 70%:30%, 55%:45%, and 40%:60%. Treatments wererepeated three times to obtain 15 units of the experiment and the data were analyzed by varianceanalysis. If there was any impact on the treatment, analysis was followed by Duncan’s test. The resultof the research have shown that comparison between the amount of sticky rice flour and tamarillo hadsignificant affects on water content, total sugar content, acidity (pH), fat content, antocyanin content,color, texture, flavor, taste, and overall acceptance. The best characteristics of dodol tamarillo wasfound on comparison between 55% sticky rice flour and 45% tamarillo with the following criteria:water content 16,45% wb, total sugar content 45,98% wb, acidity (pH) 4,66, fat content 7,18% wb,antocyanin content 8,05mg/100g, protein content 4,29% wb, texture slightly elastic, and theacceptance of color, aroma, taste, overall acceptance are like"
