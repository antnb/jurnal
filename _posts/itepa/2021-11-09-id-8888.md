## Authors:

## Abstract:
"The aim of this research was to determine the effect of the substitution between rice flour withpurple sweet potato to characteristics of “klepon” and to determine the best comparison to produce thebest characteristics of “klepon”. The design of research was Randomized Block Design. Ratio of riceflour and purple sweet potato were : 100% : 0%, 90% : 10%, 80%: 20%, 70% : 30%, 60% : 40%, 50%: 50%, respectively. The treatments were replicated three times. Data were analyzed with ANOVAand if the was treatment effect on the observed variables, further analyzed by Duncan’s test. The bestcharacteristics of “klepon” was indicated by application of ratio of rice flour 60% : purple sweetpotato 40%. The following criteria water content 24,25 (% wb); ash 0,56 (% wb); protein 2,48 (%wb); fat 1,34 (% wb); carbohydrate 71,37 (% wb); and anthocyanin 0,08%, while the sensoryevaluation criteria normal color, normal texture, normal aroma, taste rather liked, dan the overallacceptance criteria rather liked"
