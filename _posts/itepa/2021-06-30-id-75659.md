Observed variabels were water content, extract water content, vitamin C, total phenolic, total flavonoid, antioxidant activity, scoring test, and hedonic test. The obtained data were analyzed by using the analysis of variance. If it had a significant effect, it was continued to be tested by using the Duncan Multiple Range Test. The results showed that the addition of emprit ginger powder had a very significant effect on the water content, vitamin C, total phenolic, total flavonoid, antioxidant activity, aroma (scoring and hedonic test), taste (scoring and hedonic test), and overall acceptance, while extract levels in the water had a significant effect and color (hedonic test) had a non significant effect.
