All of the drying were repeated four times to obtain 16 units of experiment. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) used to get data and if the drying had a significant effect, it was followed by the Duncan Multiple Range Test. The results showed that drying had a significant effect (P &lt;0,01) on total curcuminoids, total phenols, total flavonoids, and sensory analysis of colour (scoring test). Drying using room temperature or dry wind had the best characteristic of zedoary rhizome herbal tea bag with content: total curcuminoid of 29,10 mg CE / g, total phenol of 167,51 mg GAE / g, and total flavonoid of 41,47 mg QE / g.
