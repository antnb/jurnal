## Abstract:
"This research was conducted to determine effect the kinds of solvent to antioxidant activity and total flavonoid of the extract matoa leaf. The experimental design used in this research was a randomized block design with 5 treatments (water, methanol 95%, ethanol 95%, acetone 90% and isopropanol 96%). The treatment was repeated three times to obtain 15 experimental units. The data were analyzed by randomized block design. If there was a significant effect on the observed parameters, then followed by Duncan multiple range test. The result showed that the treatment significantly effected (P&lt;0.01) on antioxidant activity and total flavonoid. The highest of antioxidant was obtained on acetone that was 27.526 mg/100gram GAEAC and IC 50 of 43,53 ppm. The highest of total flavonoid 1,99 % was obtain on methanol treatment."
