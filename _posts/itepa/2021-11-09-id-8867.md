## Abstract:
"This research aims to investigate the effect of formulations of wheat and cocoyam flour usedin bread making and to know the comparison of wheat and cocoyam flour that produce bread withgood characteristics. This research used Randomized Block Design with a comparisons of wheat andcocoyam flour as follows: 100% : 0%, 95% : 5%, 90% : 10%, 85% : 15%, 80% : 20%, 75 % : 25%and 70% : 30%. The treatments was repeated twice, so there were 14 experiment units. The data wasanalyzed by analysis of variance, if there were significant effects then followed by Duncan's test.Result of the research shown that formulation of wheat and cocoyam flour on the bread making hadsignificant effects on bread volume, water content, ash content, crude fiber content, protein content, fatcontent, flavor, color, texture and overall acceptance, but had not significant effects on taste and poresuniformity of the bread. The formulation of 85% wheat and 15% cocoyam flour, produced bread withgood characteristics by: swelling degree of 129.87%; water content of 32.13%, ash content of 1.43%,protein content of 16.42%, fat content of 10.09%, crude fiber content of 6.33%, carbohydrate contentof 39.92%, pores uniformity of bread was mostly uniform, color was mostly liked, flavor was mostlyliked, taste was mostly liked, texture was mostly liked, and overall acceptance was mostly liked."
