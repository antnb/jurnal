The design used in this study was a completely randomized design (CRD) with the addition of carrageenan which consisted of 5 treatment levels, namely: 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% and 5%, each treatment was repeated 3 times to obtain 15 experimental units. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance and if the treatment had a significant effect (P&lt;0.05) on the observed variables, then it was continued with Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT). The results showed that the addition of carrageenan had a significant effect on water content, reduction sugar content, level of elasticity, color sensory, texture, aroma, taste, and overall acceptance of noni salad jelly candy. The treatment with the addition of 4% carrageenan produced noni salad jelly candy with the best characteristics, namely water content 18.75%, ash content 0.92%, reduction sugar content 30.82%, texture 18.06 N, brown color were liked, neutral aroma, taste were liked, chewy texture were liked, and overall acceptance were liked."
