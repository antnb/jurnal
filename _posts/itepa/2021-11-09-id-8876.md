## Abstract:
"This study aimed to determine the concentration of citric acid and sugar to produce jellytamarillo with the best characteristics. Experimental design used was Randomized Block Designfactorial with factors I is the concentration of citric acid that consists of four levels; 1. 0% (w/v)concentration of citric acid from volume of friut juice, 2. 2 % (w/v) concentration of citric acid fromvolume of fruit juce, 3. 4 % (w/v) concentration of citric acid from volume of fruit juice, 4. 6 %citric acid (w/v) concentration of citric acid from volume of fruit juice and the second factor is theconcentration of sugar that consists of three levels such as: 1. the sugar concentration of 45 g in 45ml of fruit juice, 2. 55 g in 45 ml of fruit juice, 3. 65 g in 45 ml of fruit juice. The treatment wasrepeated 2 times to obtained 24 units of the experiment and the data were analyzed by analysis ofvariance. If there is any effect of the treatment, the analysis followed by Duncan's Multiple RangeTest. The results showed that the treatment of the interaction between citric acid and sugar very realeffect on the moisture content, anthocyanin content, total sugars, and total dissolved solids, whilethe treatment of acid concentration was highly significant to the degree of acidity (pH) and citricacid and sugar treatment had no effect significant effect on the color, texture, aroma, flavor, overallacceptance. Treatment concentration of citric acid 2% of the volume of fruit juice and sugar 65 g in45 ml of fruit juice produces jelly with the best characteristics with the criteria: water content of65.60% w / w, 0.42 mg/100g anthocyanin content, total sugar 31.31%, 2.75 pH, total dissolvedsolids 17.10 oBrix, color rather like, chewy texture, aroma rather like, flavor rather like and overallacceptance rather like"
