## Abstract:
"Honey is composed of reducing sugars i.e. glucose, fructose, and maltose. The concentration of sugar honeyis determined as total reducing sugars, so the concentration of each sugar which compose the honey is not known.The research aims to determine the concentrations of glucose and fructose of honey from different cotton tree honeyand longan honey HPLC using.The HPLC operational condition was as follows 80oC of column temperature and 1 mL/minutes of flowrate, using metacarb 87C column and deionized watr as eluent. The detection was carried out by using refractiveindex detector, where glucose and fructose can be separated at retention times of 6 and 7 minutes.The result of research showed that the concentration of glucose in cotton tree honey was 27.13 % and inlongan honey was 28.09 %. the concentration of fructose in cotton tree honey was 40.99 % and in longan honey was40.03 %. Thees results showed that the quality standard on the total concentration of reducing sugar (60 %) was metby both types of honey. The total concentration of reducing sugar of cotton tree honey was 68.12 % and of longanhoney was 68.12 %."
