## Abstract:
"The research on the isolation of Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL) from seed husk of cashew nut by solidliquidextraction has been carried out. The extraction used mixture of chlorofom-ethanol (3:1, 1:1, 1:3) and hexaneethanol(3:1, 1:1, 1:3). The extract was analysed for its phisico-chemical properties namely density, viscosity, acidity,and iod number. The extract with highest rendement was analysed by GC-MS (gas cromatography-massspectrometry) and infrared (IR) spectrophotometer to prove that anacardic was the mayor component of CNSL.The highest rendement (44.38 %) was resulted from the extraction using 3:1 hexane-ethanol. The extract hasa density of 0.9352 g/mL, a viscosity of 8.98 pise, acid of 96.94 mg NaOH/g CNSL, and 86.98 g iod/100g CNSL.The GC-MS and IR analyses showed that the major component of CNSL was anacardic acid."
