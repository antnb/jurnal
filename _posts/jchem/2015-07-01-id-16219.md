## Abstract:
"The research was conducted to observe diphenylcarbazide immobilization on silica gel from rice husk ash (Si-CPTMS-DPZida) with sol-gel technique. The aim of this research was to modify silica gel from rice husk ash by immobilization with diphenylcarbazide using sol-gel technique. This research included the modification and characterization of silica gel. The characterizations of silica gel were done by using infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (X-RD). The results showed that the immobilized diphenylcarbazide silica has been formmed which is indicated by the appearance of Si-OH functional group in the peak at wave number 914,26 cm-1, Si-O-Si at 1091,71 cm-1, the stretching vibration of NH group at 3645 cm-1 and proved in 1492 cm-1 which is the bending vibrations of the NH group, CH (aromatic) at 802.39 cm-1, vibrational bending C = C (aromatic) at 1612 cm-1, vibration CN group at 1310 cm-1, and the vibrations of the C = O group in the area of 1685 cm-1. The X-RD data showed that the structure of Si-CPTMS-DPZida is amorphous."
