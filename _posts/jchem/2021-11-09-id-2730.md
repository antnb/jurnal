## Abstract:
"Intercalation of Bentonit clay with quaternary ammonium salt, N-cetyl, N,N,N –trimethyl ammoniumbromide in the presence of palmitic acid was investigated in this research. The aim was to improve the capacity ofBentonit clay as adsorbent for lead ion (Pb2+). The salt used has a capacity of 8 mmol/10kg clay, which equal to itscapacity as cation exchanged. After intercalating process, palmitic acid was added and then clay was ready to beused as adsorbent for lead ion (Pb2+).Characterisation of physical chemistry properties of the intercalated Bentonit clay was performed using Xraydiffractometer for basal spacing distance between interlayer Bentonit clay, infra red spectrometer for Brownsteadacid site, and atomic adsorption spectroscopy to determine the capacity of adsorption by analyzing isothermadsorption and equilibrium temperature data.It was found that the intercalation of Bentonit clay with quaternary ammonium salt, N-cetyl, N,N,N –trimethyl ammonium bromide increased the distance between interlayer Bentonit clay (basal spacing from 15.9236Ao to 21.0554 Ao. The infra red spectra data revealed the appearance of Brownstead acid site at n 1419.5 cm-1. Theresult also found that the capacity of Bentonit clay as adsorbent for lead ion (Pb2+) improved from 1.9565 mg/gbefore intercalation to 4.0263 mg/g (after intercalation process)."
