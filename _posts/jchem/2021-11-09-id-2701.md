## Abstract:
"Isolation and identification of the compound which has a potency as antitumor from bitter melon have beencarried out. Extraction was conducted n-hexane, chloroform, and ethanol respectively using each extracts obtainedwere examined with brine shrimp lethality test. The most toxic extract was ethanol extract (LC50 223 ppm).Separation and purification of the compounds from the ethanol extract were conducted by column chromatogaraphyusing a gel silica 60 as the stationary phase and benzene : acetic acid ( 8:2) as the mobile phase. This yielded 3fractions. Then the fractions were examined with brine shrimp lethality test and the most toxic fraction was found tobe the fraction 1 (LC50 31,62 ppm), but the fraction that was analysed further was fraction 3 (LC50 100 ppm),because fraction 1 consists of using compounds that were difficult to separate. The purity fraction 3 was testedconducted thin layer chromatography and its activity as antitumor agent was tested using Agrobacterium tumefacienA-208. The test was in 6 weeks and that fraction 3 has a potency as an antitumor agent at 1000 ppm.The identification with gas chromatography – mass spectroscopy indicate that the antitumor isolate frombitter melon contains 3 mayor compoundsnamely dioxtyl hexadioate esther, palmitic acid, stearic acid."
