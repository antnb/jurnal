## Abstract:
"The influence of Vernonia cinerea Less. on spermatogenesis of rat has been investigated. This research washeld into two steps. The first activity was isolation and purification of the herb of. V. cinerea Less.. The purity ofisolate was showed by the appearance of only one spot on chromatogram and its physical characteristic. The secondstep was identification the spermatogenesis using three groups of rat for 49 days namely i.e. normal group that wasadministered by normal saline, group I that is administered by 0.05 mg/g body weight of V. cinerea Less. isolate i.p.,and group II that was administered by 0.025 mg/g B.W of V. cinerea Less. isolate i.p. Histological preparat withPAS- Hematoxylin dyeing was used in tubulus seminiferus observation. The result showed the cocci form of tubulusseminiferus and basalis membrane appearance. This concluded that the isolate of V. cinerea Less. herbs influencedthe spermatogenesis of rat."
