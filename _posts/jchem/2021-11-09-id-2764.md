## Abstract:
"Isolation of flavonoid antibacterial compounds from Awar-awar root skin (Ficus septica Burm.f) has beencarried out. As much as 120.0 g of concentrated methanol extract was resulted from 3.9 kg dry powder of Awar-awarroot skin. About 60.0 g of this extract was dissolved into 2 N hydrochloride acid and then partitioned withchloroform. Extraction of the acid extract using chloroform resulted in 0.82 g of chloroform concentrated extractwhich contained flavonoids. Further, the separation of this extract using column chromatography resulted in 8fractions namely F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7 and F8 fraction. The result of flavonoid test of the eight fractions suggestedthat F2, F5, and F6 fractions contained flavonoid compounds. The purification of F2 fraction using n-hexane obtained 2fraction F2.1 and F2.2 (0.13 g and 0.01 g respectively). Infra red and ultra violet-visible spectroscopy were employed inorder to identify the F2.1 fraction. From infra red spectra, it was identified that the isolate had –OH, C=O, C=C andC-H aromatic and C-H aliphatic. The ultra violet-visible spectra showed 2 peaks at 328.6 nm (band I) and 281.5 nm(band II) which indicated flavonoid class compounds flavanon or dihidroflavonol. By using ”shitting” reagent theisolate was suggested to contain flavanon group with hydroxy groups at C-2’, C-5’ or C-6’ and C-8, and methyl orglycosilacy goups at C-5 and C-7 atom. The isolate flavanon showed antibacterial activity toward Vibrio cholera andEschericia coli."
