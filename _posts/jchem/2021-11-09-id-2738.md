## Abstract:
"Synthesis of biodiesel from used cooking oil was carried out in two step reactions i.e esterification andtransesterification. The biodiesel obtained was analysed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometer (GC-MS).The quality was determined by comparing its physico chemical properties and compared to the Jerman Standard DINV 51606.The result of GC-MS showed 6 peaks coresponding to six methyl ester(biodiesel): methyl myristate, methylpalmitate, methyl linoleate, methyl oleate, methyl stearat and methyl arachydate. The biodiesel obtained has a densityof (0,8976±0,0003 g/mL), viscosity of (4,53±0,0872 mm/s), acid value of (0,4238±0,0397 mg KOH/g, and iodnumber of (9,3354±0,0288 g iod/100 g sample). There properties were in a good agreement with the standard JermanDIN 51606."
