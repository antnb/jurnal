## Abstract:
"Separation of cellulose from sawdust using methanol and hydrocloric acid in various acid concentrations has been carried out. Cellulose from sawdust was characterized using FT-IR Spectroscopy and XRD difractometer. The cellulose was used as adsorbent for Mn2+ and Co2+ metal ions in aqueous medium. Adsorptions process was studied through variation of time interaction, concentration and separation desorption. FT-IR Spectrum shows that cellulose with 5% acid concentration has similarity with FT-IR cellulose standard. The XRD difractometer pattern of cellulose shows that cellulose has amorf structure. The adsorption rate constant of Mn2+ on cellulose from sawdust shows adsorption rate constant in cellulose is higher than in sawdust. Adsorption energy of Mn2+ metal ion in cellulose from sawdust was about 26.21 kJ/mol. The adsorption capacity of Mn2+ in cellulose is higher than in sawdust. The desorption of Mn2+ metal ion using H2O, Na-EDTA, Amonium acetic, and HCl shows that the adsorption mechanism of Mn2+ on cellulose and sawdust is dominated by chemical interaction."
