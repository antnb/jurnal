## Abstract:
"Analysis of anti freeradical compounds from Kepuh (Sterculia foetida L.) seed flesh oil has beenconducted. The isolation of kepuh seed flesh was carried out by maseration using n-hexane and ethanol. Antifreeradical test was carried out by spectroscopy method using DPPH as free radical. The analysis of the compoundsextracted accomplised was used Gas Column Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS).900 gram Kepuh seed yielded 250 mL oil n-hexane extract and 59,5 mL from ethanol extract. The resultof the anti freeradical test showed that the oil from n-hexane extract was not potencial as a anti freeradical agentwhile the oil from ethanol extract has a potency as a anti freeradical agent with damping percentage of 55,07%during 5 minutes and 85,05% during 60 minutes.The analysis using GC-MS, showed that ethanol extract oil from the flesh of kepuh seed contained 8 majorcomponent with relative concentration of methyl palmitate 3956,783 ppm (235,428 mg); palmitic acid 1837,414ppm (109,326 mg); ethyl palmitate 39288,783 ppm (2337,683 mg); (14Z,16Z)-ethyl octadeca-14,16-dienoate17062,660 ppm (1015,228 mg); (15Z,17Z)-methyl nonadeca-15,17-dienoate 19988,563 ppm (1189,319 mg); ethylstearate 4365,666 ppm (259,757 mg); (1Z,4Z)-1-methoxy-9,9,10,14-tetramethyl pentadeca-1,4-diena 22421,631 ppm(1334,087 mg); and (1Z,12Z,16Z)-1-ethoxy-6 methoxy octadeca 1,12,16-triena 78001,041 ppm (4672,262 mg)."
