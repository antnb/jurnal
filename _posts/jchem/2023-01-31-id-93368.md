## Abstract:
"Limbah industri umumnya mengandung logam Pb, Zn, Cr, Mn, dan Cu. Logam-logam ini sangat berbahaya sehingga perlu dilakukan pengolahan limbah, seperti menggunakan adsorben yang mempunyai luas permukaan besar, contohnya silika mesopori (SM). SM dapat dibuat dari silika pasir pantai. Pasir diekstraksi dengan larutan HCl untuk mendapatkan silika, dilanjutkan dengan refluks menggunakan NaOH. Silika diproses menjadi SM dengan templet Dodesil Amina (DDA). Proses pembentukan SM dalam kondisi asam dilakukan dengan variabel pH 3, pH 4 dan pH 5. SM yang terbentuk digunakan untuk adsorpsi limbah percetakan. Hasilnya menunjukkan karakter SM optimum didapatkan pada pH 4 dengan luas permukaan 286,46 m2/g, volume pori total 10,9 cm3/g dan diameter pori 15,21 nm. Limbah percetakan sebelum adsorpsi mengandung logam timbal (Pb) &lt;0,009 mg/L, tembaga (Cu) 0,5589 mg/L, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) sebesar 1740 dan Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) sebesar 6534. Adsorpsi limbah menggunakan SM optimum dilakukan pada waktu kontak 120 menit dengan kecepatan pengadukan 180 rpm. Kandungan Cu dalam filtrat setelah proses adsorpsi dengan kecepatan putaran pengaduk 180 rpm adalah sebesar 0,05 mg/L. Level BOD pada sampel setelah adsorpsi dengan waktu 120 menit terjadi penurunan 20 %, sedangkan level COD terjadi penurunan 50 %. Level BOD dan COD setelah adsorpsi masih relatif tinggi, yaitu masing-masing sebesar 1260 dan 3059,5. Hasil analisis dengan SEM-EDX Mapping pada adsorben SM setelah adsopsi menunjukkan bahwa pada adsorben masih terdapat logam Pb 1,17 %b/b dan Cu 1,48 %b/b. Hasil ini menunjukkan bahwa silika mesopori potensial dan dapat digunakan sebagai adsorben pada pengolahan limbah industri yang mengandung logam Pb dan Cu. Kata kunci: adsorpsi limbah, modifikasi pH, silika mesopori, tembaga, timbal. ABSTRACT Industrial waste generally contains Pb, Zn, Cr, Mn, and Cu metals. These metals are hazardous, therefore, a waste treatment needs to be carried out, such as by using a large surface area of adsorbent, for example, mesoporous silica (MS). MS can be prepared from beach sand silica. The sand was extracted using an HCl solution to obtain the silica, followed by refluxing it using NaOH. The silica was then processed into MS using a Dodecyl Amine (DDA) template. The process of forming MS in an acidic condition was done with the variables of pH 3, pH 4, and pH 5. The MS created was then used for the adsorption of printing waste. The results showed that the optimum MS character was obtained at pH 4 with a surface area of ??286.46 m2/g, a total pore volume of 10.9 cm3/g, and a pore diameter of 15.21 nm. The printing waste before the adsorption contained lead (Pb) of &lt;0.009 mg/L, copper (Cu) of 0.5589 mg/L, BOD of 1740, and COD of 6534. The adsorption of waste by using the optimum MS was done at a contact time of 120 minutes with a stirring speed of 180 rpm. The content of Cu in the filtrate after the adsorption using a condition of the stirrer rotation speed of 180 rpm was 0.05 mg/L. The BOD level in the sample after the adsorption with a contact time of 120 minutes decreased by 20%, while the COD level reduced by 50%. The level of BOD and COD after adsorption was still relatively high, which was 1260 and 3059.5, respectively. The results of SEM-EDX Mapping analysis on the MS adsorbent after the adsorption contained 1.17 %w/w of Pb and 1.48 %w/w of Cu. These results showed that the silica mesopore was potentially used as an adsorbent for treating the printing waste containing Pb and Cu metals. Keywords: cuprum, lead, Mesoporous Silica (MS), pH modification, waste adsorption."
