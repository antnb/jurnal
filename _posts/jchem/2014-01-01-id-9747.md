## Abstract:
"The 8-isoprostane compound can be used for a biomarker of oxidative stress formed by lipid peroxidation in the form of arachidonic acid with free radical in the body. The purpose of this study was to analysis urinary 8-isoprostane in male Wistar rats after sub-acute exposer to ethanol and cigarette smoke. Extraction method used was solid phase extraction and the analysis was conducted by TLC and spectrophotodensitometry. The results showed that the 8-isoprostane compound was not detected in the male Wistar rat’s urine as control rats and in those exposed to cigarette smoke. The average concentrations of 8-Isoprostane in the male Wistar rat’s urine exposed to ethanol and combination of ethanol-cigarette were 1.519 ± 1,386 and 2.063 ± 1,308 ppm respectively."
