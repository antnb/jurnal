It is a normative legal research thatuses statutory and analitical-conseptual approaches. It can be concluded that the creditcard holders are given legal protection from the Regulation of Bank Indonesia (CentralBank). In case loss of credit card holders, both banks and debt collectors have differentresponsibility. More specifically, the bank is responsible to provide compensation in theform of a sum of money to the customer, meanwhile, debt collectors will be imposedcriminal responsibility for their actions."
