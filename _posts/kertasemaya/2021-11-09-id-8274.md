This type of research used in this paper is a type of research that is based on the normative juridical rules of law that has to do with the issues raised yag author. Legal adoption procedures in Indonesia is regulated in some legislation, such as : 1917, State Gazette No. 129, the Supreme Court Circular 6 of 1983, Law No. 23 of 2002 on Child Protection, and Government Regulation No. 54 Year 2007 on the Implementation of Child Adoption. Adopted children have the same position with the heirs ab intestato. So should an adopted child has the same status as heir ab intestato to obtain inheritance according to civil law.
