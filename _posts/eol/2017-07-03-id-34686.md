Therefore, the phenomenon of HL shift was analyzed based on the choice of HL language use in a domain that implies HL maintenance by its speakers among generations. In order to get the expected data, this study involved 100 respondents consisting groups of 40 parents, 29 adults, and 31 children. The data obtained through data collection techniques were analyzed by using quantitative and qualitative methods.
