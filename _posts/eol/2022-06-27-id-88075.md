To explain the various implied meanings, it is necessary to use methods and methods that are in accordance with the lines. the methodology used is the type of research, the method of collecting and analyzing data such as qualitative descriptive taken from theory (Sudaryanto, 2015) is this research method because words, phrases are forms to explain data.
