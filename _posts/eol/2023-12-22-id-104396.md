## Authors:
Mehriban Baghirova

## Abstract:
"Dialectology is the study of dialects, while dialectometry is the measurement of dialect variations, i.e. linguistic differences, the distribution of which is determined primarily by geography. New sources of information and analytical software are expanding the scope of dialectometry. Dialectometric methods were analyzed in the research work. The possibilities of using dialectometric methods in Azerbaijan were investigated and recommendations were given in the direction of their application."
