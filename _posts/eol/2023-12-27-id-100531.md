## Abstract:
"The translation process does not only deal with language structure and semantic meaning, but it is also highly influenced by social and cultural meaning. Furthermore, besides transferring the meaning from SL to TL, translation also attempts to carry over the message contained in SL texts to the TL texts with readable and acceptable consideration. This research aims to reveal the translation procedures applied in the French-Indonesian novel, Madame Bovary, especially in translating culture-specific terms. The data were taken from the French novel Madame Bovary written by Gustave Flaubert in 1972 and its translation version written by Santi Hendrawati in 2010. Borrowing with calque and transference, literal translation, cultural equivalent, addition, omission, generalization, descriptive equivalent, naturalization, transposition, and modulation are the translation procedures used by the translator. Different languages with different cultures potentially lead the translator to face some crucial problems in translating texts. One of the best ways to solve that problem is by using appropriate translation procedures."
