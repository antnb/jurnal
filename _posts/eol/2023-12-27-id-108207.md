## Abstract:
"This study aims to explore politeness maxims in teachers’ request in English Foreign Language instructional context (Henceforth: EFL). The research method was qualitative which utilized the data from the teachers’ utterances during instructional process at the Eleventh-grade students of high schools in Manggarai region, East Nusa Tenggara Province. A non-participant observation and a field-note taking were the methods of data collection, which utitilized audio-video recording and note-taking techniques. The instruments are digital audio-video recorder, field-note, and observation sheet. The data were qualitatively analyzed through three steps; data condensation, data display, and drawing conclusion/verification. The data were futher interpreted based on politenes theory and politeness maxims. The results of data analysis show that politeness maxims were applied in teachers’ requests: tact, generosity, approbation, and modesty. Tact and approbation were mostly applied in teachers’requests. The types of politeness maxims were explicitly marked by pragmatic modifiers. They serve to modify and enact polite requests in classroom interaction. Based on the findings, a further investigation is prominent to be conducted in studying other related variables in EFL classroom context."
