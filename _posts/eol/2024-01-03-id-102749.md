## Abstract:
"The process of learning a foreign language as a second language, all learners will face the process of creating an interlanguage. Selinker's hypothesis (1972) says that interlanguage is different from the mother tongue and from the target language (which is being learned). If the pragmatic study is connected with the interlanguage system, it will later become a study of how speakers and non-native speakers acquire, understand, and use linguistic patterns or speech acts in a second language. Selinker (1972) classifies problems in interlanguage, one of which is a methodological problem in which one type of empirical research suggests error analysis. Error analysis or abbreviated children is a limited instrument in the investigation of second language acquisition (PB2). Burt, Dulay, or Krashen (1982) differentiate areas (taxonomies) for language errors. The first is a taxonomy of linguistic categories which classifies errors based on the components of language, namely phonology (speech), syntax and morphology (grammar; grammar), semantics and lexicon of meaning, and discourse (style). This study describes the interlanguage problem which is included in the "taxonomy of linguistic categories" that occurs in the speech process of teaching Indonesian at bilingual schools, namely Canggu Community School and Green School Bali."
