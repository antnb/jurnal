## Abstract:
"Melasti Beach is a beach-based tourist attraction located in Badung Regency, the southern region of Bali Island. One of the attractions of ecotourism from the beach is that it is often used as a spot for taking prewedding photos. This study aims to determine the type of signs that indicate a special area for prewedding services at Melasti Beach. In addition, this study also describes the type of language used in the prewedding sign. From the observations made at Melasti Beach, many signs are used to indicate special facilities for prewedding activities. The theory used is Nash (2016) Landscape Linguistic Theory with a method used to analyze the types of prewedding sign signs in public spaces accompanied by a Geosemiotic approach by Scollon and Scollon (2003). This research uses qualitative research methods, namely by taking several photos of signboards and signs related to prewedding signs. Data were analyzed using the taxonomy of Spolsky and Cooper (1991). This research uses qualitative research methods, namely by taking several photos of signboards and signs related to prewedding facilities. From the results of the analysis, it was found that signs related to prewedding facilities include Toilet For Prewedd Only, Dressing Room For Prewedd Only, Private Prewedd Only, and Photo Shoot Only. All of these signs are written monolingually, namely in English. This shows that prewedding activities are predominantly carried out by foreign tourists although there are also local (domestic) tourists who also do prewedding activities at Melasti Beach"
