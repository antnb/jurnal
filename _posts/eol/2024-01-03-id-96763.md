## Abstract:
"This research adopted conversational analysis to investigate the turn-taking strategies, how the strategies were applied, and the dominant strategy. The researchers used Jamie Miller’s interview with Zach Sang show as the data source. Observing the data source and typing the conversations were done to collect data. The collected data were further analyzed by using referential identity method and referential competence- in equalizing technique. All processes of this research were in accordance with the characteristics of descriptive qualitative research. The theory invented by Stenstrom (1994) was used to analyze data and Jefferson (2004)’s transcription symbols theory was implemented to transcribe the conversations. The results exposed that 78 utterances referred to turn-taking strategies and 11 strategies were employed. The data involved eight data of hesitant start and uptakes, seven data of clean start and uptakes, one data of alerts and giving up, nine data of filled pause and/or verbal fillers, 13 data of lexical repetition, 12 data of prompting, and three data of appealing. From the total data, lexical repetition was found as the dominant strategy. The participants mostly repeated the same lexical items to manage the conversation flow and avoid the speech gap."
