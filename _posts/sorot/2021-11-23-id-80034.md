The theoretical basis used in this research is Peter L. Berger's theory of social construction. the eccentric teachings of the Samin community are the result of Samin Surosentiko's externalization to fight against the invaders The construction of eccentric teachings on the Samin community in the Jepang Hamlet of has not been legitimized since knowing the independence of Indonesia in 1965.The teachings of Samin that are still carried out by the Samin community in the Jepang Hamlet are the teachings of kebatinan/morality. Keywords: eccentric teachings, social construction, changes in the Samin community."
