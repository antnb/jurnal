## Abstract:
"This study to determine elite Puri Ubud, Puri Peliatan, and Puri Gianyar compete in the Gianyar Pilbup 2012-2018. This research uses conflict theory from Ralf Dahrendorf with qualitative descriptive method, uses primary and secondary data. The results of the research are: first, the rivalry that occurred was an old rivalry and was repeated in the 2012 Gianyar Pilbup, which at that time also showed that the political struggle between brothers was won by the elite of Puri Gianyar. Second, the defeat of the Puri Peliatan elite made the Puri Ubud elite take a political role fight the Puri Gianyar elite in the 2018 Pilbup and another victory was won by Puri Gianyar. The defeat of Puri Peliatan and Puri Ubud was due to the lack of character, party base. In addition to clan stakes, party bases also dominate this conflict, PDIP (Puri Gianyar) and Golkar (Puri Ubud and Puri Peliatan). Keyword: Rivalry, Elites Puri, Regional Head Election, Gianyar Regency, Year 2012-2018"
