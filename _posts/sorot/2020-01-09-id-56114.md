The sampling technique uses purposive sampling. Research subjects are female students and make-up beauty advisors. Data validity uses source triangulation and data analysis uses Miles and Huberman interactive. The results showed that the use of make up gave rise to internal factors namely physical deficiencies and liking for make up, and external factors were affecting friends, parents, beauty vloggers, and improving work and organization. The meaning of using make up is the importance to look perfect, get personal attention and satisfaction. Keywords: makeup, personal identity, impact"
