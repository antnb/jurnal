## Abstract:
"Aplication Geographic Informastion System (GIS) for Study of Ground Water Fluctuations and Characteristics of Aquifers in the District of North Denpasar, Denpasar City The use of water in everyday life is very influential on the pattern of water use available. Ground water is water located on rock is layer below the water is surface. The study was conducted in North Denpasar District, Denpasar City from November 2018 to March 2019. The method used is a survey method, purposive sampling method and descriptive quantitative. The results of the study is ground water fluctuations are ??between 0 m - 5 m and 5 m - 10 m. Distribution of the depth of the ground water in the North Denpasar District which varied greatly in the dry season between 4,5 m – 22,1 m and in the rainy season between 5,1 m – 21,6 m.
