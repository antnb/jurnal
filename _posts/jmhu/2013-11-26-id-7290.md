## Abstract:

Bali Local Government Regulation Number 5of 2012 on the Circulation of Alcoholic Beverage Control only requires each hasa label on alcoholic beverages issued by the Government of Bali has to bedistributed to the public, while the authority of the Food and Drug Administrationis regulated in the Regulation of Minister of Health of the Republic of IndonesiaNumber 382/MENKES/PER/VI/1989 on Registration of Food that requires allfood produced both by local producers and imported foods are required to beregistered to the Ministry of Health through the Food and Drug Administration.In the Regulation Number 5 Year 2012 did not include the authority of theFood and Drug Administration (the Empty Norms) so that the Food and DrugAdministration can not perform optimally the law enforcement againstmanufacturers, distributors and sellers of alcoholic beverages in violation. Tocope with the condition it should be a amendment in the Bali ProvincialRegulation Number 5 of 2012 by stating firmly and clearly the authority of theFood and Drug Administration related to the registration of food, which requiresthat for all foods and beverages that will be distributed to the public must beregistered to the Ministry of Health through the Food and Drug Administration."
