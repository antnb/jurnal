Different treatment of non-ASEAN countries in the said Presidential Regulation whether it is a breach of the non-discrimination principle. It is deemed important to be investigated to know whether the investment regulations in Indonesia for the investors from ASEAN and Non-ASEAN countries have implemented the non-discrimination principle. Statutory and analytical of conceptual approach type in normative legal research were used in this writing. Indonesia as a developing country shall be included in the exemption by the WTO to make regulations which in this case give special treatment to ASEAN member countries as stipulated in Article 4 of the TRIMs and flexibility in implementing the non-discrimination principle referred to in Article 4 and 5 of GATS."
