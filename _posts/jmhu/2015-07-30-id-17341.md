The type of this research belonged to the study of empirical law. The result of research shows that, first, the type of law protection provided by the state towards traditional motifs is in the form of preventive and repressive law protection. Second, legal culture of silversmiths in Bali view traditional motifs as a work substance with work orientation is for a living so that value system being adopted by most silversmiths in Bali is not to register their works into the Copyright system."
