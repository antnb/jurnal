## Abstract:
"An invasive Piper aduncum is a plant species that potentially produces essential oil. The study aims todetermine the percentage, phytochemical compounds, and anti-fungal properties of essential oil producedfrom the leaves and fruits of Piper aduncum. The study showed that the leaves and fruits of P. aduncumcontain 0.30% and 0.33% of essential oil, respectively. Apiol is the most abundant phytochemical compoundobtained in essential oil of leaves and fruits of P. aduncum with 57.10% and 66.31%, respectively. Weconclude that essential oil obtained in this study is able to inhibit the growth of both Aspergillus niger andCladosporium sp. but not for Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani."
