## Abstract:
"School children snacks are food that is found and routinely consumed by children in the school environment.Good and healthy food must be free from hazardous and toxic materials, such as microbial contamination,chemicals and other materials. The consumed food must meet the microbial contamination requirementsbased on SNI (Standar Nasional Indonesia) safety testing. Pathogenic bacteria still a serious problem invarious countries including Indonesia, since they are capable of causing foodborne diseases. Sapeken Islandis located in Sapeken Village, Sapeken District, Sumenep Regency, East Java Province. The purpose of thestudy was to determine the presence of pathogenic bacteria in samples of snacks for school children onSapeken Island. The method used was the Most Probable Number (MPN) for Escherichia coli, Test Numberof Bacillus sp., Test Number of Staphyllococcus sp., Identification of Salmonella, and Total Plate Count(TPC). The test results obtained in the MPN of Escherichia coli included SD M (9.9 ± 3.8) MPN / g, SD 5(8.68 ± 2.73) MPN / g, SD IT (5.08 ± 0.66) MPN / g, and SD 4 (4.26 ± 2.44) MPN / g exceed the SNI limit.JURNAL BIOLOGI UDAYANA 23(2): 60-71 P ISSN: 1410-5292 E ISSN: 2599-285661The results of JPT E. coli in snack empek-empek at SD I and SD 2, and JPT E. coli ojek in all elementaryschools is &lt;3 MPN / g. The results of the empek-empek and ojek samples in all elementary schools for alltests with the parameter number Bacillus sp. is &lt;1 x 103, the number of Staphylococcus sp. is &lt;1 x 102,Salmonella identification is negative, TPC is &lt;1 x 105 CFU / g. The conclusion of the study is snack forschool children (empek-empek) and ojek on Sapeken Island does not contain contamination of pathogenicbacteria Escherichia coli, Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Salmonella identification, and TPC, except forthe JPT E. coli test on empek empek in SD M, SD 5, SD IT and SD 4 that exceed SNI limits."
