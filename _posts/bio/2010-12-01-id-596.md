## Abstract:
"his research was done in order to utilize agricultural waste (rice straw) as substrate to produce crude cellulase enzyme from Aspergillus niger. This research was conducted in two stages; the first stage was determination of the initial pH and fermentation time by pH treatment (5, 6 and 7) and fermentation time (7, 9 and 11 days). The second stage was determination of concentration of NaOH treatment and concentration of substrate, namely: concentrations of NaOH (2, 4 and 6%) and concentrations of substrate (1, 2 and 3% (w/v)). The results showed that the fermentation time of 9 days with the initial pH 6.0 was the optimal condition for production of crude cellulase enzyme from A. niger with rice straw as a substrate. The highest enzyme activity derived from interaction of delignification treatment with NaOH concentration of 6% and 2% rice straw substrate which produces endoglukanase enzyme activity (0.037 units/ml), filter paperase activity (0.033 units/ml), soluble protein (0.362 mg/ml), and specific activity of filter paperase (0.123 units/mg)."
