## Abstract:
"A study on activity of the Little Egret (Egretta garzetta) was conducted in Serangan Island, southern part ofBali between May and June 2016. The aim of this study was to find out daily activities of these birds in threedifferent habitats: lagoons, mangrove forests and muddy beaches. Preliminary observation was conducted throughAd Libitum sampling, while the sample on the main study was through a scan sampling method. The data wascollected through recording activities of the egret on interval of 30 seconds within two hours. The data collectionwas undertaken in three periods: morning, afternoon and evening. The colony of observed egrets was chosenrandomly across habitats and time periods. Data collected were descriptively or quantitatively analysed. Results ofthe study showed that from the three observation periods, the egret activities were dominated by the sameactivities, that was foraging, but with different magnitudes or percentages. In contrast, activities with the lowestpercentage was agonistic. In the lagoon area, the percentage of the activity of foraging was as follows: in themorning it was 50.15%, in the afternoon 46,62%, and in the evening 49,63%. In mangrove areas the percentage offoraging activities was as follows: in the morning it was 52.46%, in the afternoon 41.60%, and in the evening50.83%. The percentage of foraging activities in muddy beaches was as follows: in the morning it was 50.18%, inthe afternoon 42.70%, and in the evening 49,65%.Keywords : little egret, Serangan Island, daily activities, habitat, Bali"
