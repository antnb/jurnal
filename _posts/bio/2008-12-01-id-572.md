Rehabilitated Orangutans was found to have higher proportion of social activity (79,29%) than the one of self-action activity (23,71%). The daily activity proportions consisted of 10,44% (females) and 14,13% (males) for movement, 29,01% (females) and 30,66% (males) for resting, 12,34% (females) and 4,90% (males) for social activities, 3,36% (females) and 2,49% (males) for self activities, and also 44,85% (females) and 47,82% (males) for foraging with 96 plants species and 1 termite species as food sources."
