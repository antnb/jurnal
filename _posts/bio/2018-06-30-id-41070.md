## Abstract:
"ABSTRACTChicken nuggets, the one of protein rich foods, is produced from the chicken meat through several stages ofthe process. This research aimed to identify the potential hazards of chicken nuggets process in final productsbased on physical, chemical and biological hazards perspectives. The hazardous potentials were performedspecifically using observations, interviews and investigations in a slaughterhouse unit and production unit.Furthermore, the finding of data was described qualitatively. The results of this study indicated that there wereseveral potential hazards in physical, chemical and biological in a chicken nugget process. The ear problems,exhausted of workers, watered by heat frying oil were the examples of potential hazards in physical. In addition,contamination of heavy metal in product and the expired of food grade oil were an illustration of chemicalpotential hazards. Then, microorganisms in end products, the source of the pathogen were the examples ofbiological hazards potential. Finally, it could be concluded that chicken nugget factory possessed the physical,chemical, and biological potential hazards.Key words: observations, interviews, findings, microorganisms."
