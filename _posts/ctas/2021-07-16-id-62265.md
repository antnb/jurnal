This research aims to provide an overview of conditions and threats to Sardinella around Pengambengan NFP as one of the largest fishing ports in Bali Strait includes Sardinella fisheries production in Pengambengan NFP, sex ratio, gonad maturity level, gonad maturity index, conditions factor, so Sardinella resources can be created sustainable.

The sex ratio of Sardinella landed in Pengambengan NFP has a ratio of 0.8: 1. Gonad Maturity Level obtained in TKG I and TKG II so the Gonad Maturity Index found was around 0.0291-0.2188. The range of condition factors from 0.9-1.4, it means Sardinella in the plump category.Sardinella lemuru; PPN Pengambengan; Reproduction"
