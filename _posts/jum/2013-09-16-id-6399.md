It also has been usedas the code of conduct for the community members of Junjungan customary village for 10 years. However, theawig-awig has yet not considered representative that it has not been responsive to represent the people’s need anddevelopment in the community. Besides, this village is located in a strategic area of Ubud which is known as oneof the tourist centers in Bali. As a result, the revision of awig-awig that makes it more responsive to communitydevelopment is significantly needed. The method utilized in this event is discussion and consultation in whichthe community members are actively involved in redesigning their awig-awig. The techniques on how to writethe articles in the traditional law are also the main focus in this event. All community leaders and communitymembers involved in this event and gave their support so that a new guidance in the revision of the awig-awigof Junjungan village is successfully made and redesigned.
