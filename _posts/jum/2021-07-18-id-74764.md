The Training has been carried out at 24 August 2019 at The Field Station of Faculty of Agriculture, Udayana University, Denpasar. The participants were a group of housewives and some lecturers who will get their resign in the next few years. The outcome of the current community services is an improvement of the skill of participants in making orchid hybrids through artificial pollination and also skill in aclimatisation of bottled-orchid seedlings.
