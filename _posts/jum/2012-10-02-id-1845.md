Even tough the majority of the waste is organic, it still became a disturbance because of its large volume. Hence, a special method or treatment is needed to solve this problem. Composting this organic waste through the helps of micro-organisms is became the selected method because this process is able to decreases the volume of the organic waste, and also the fermented waste is useful as an organic fertilizer. The fermented waste add a value to the zallaca’s farmer in order to decrease the dependency to artificial fertilizer, and helps increase the income of the zallaca’s farmer with the decrease allocations of farming expenses to bought an artificial fertilizer."
