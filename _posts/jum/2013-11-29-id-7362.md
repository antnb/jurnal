To overcomethis problem it is needed to coating the surface of the brass handicrafts so that there will be no contact withoxygen. The coating will be more benefit if able to exhibit more interesting appearance, as what nickel coatingcan affect the appearance of the surface to become like silver but more clear. Equipment for nickel elektroplatingwas designed for this purpose and donated for this purpose. The unique of the equipment that was donated weresmall in size therefore only low electric power is needed, only 1 liter electrolyte was used and can be use manytime. The positive result is obtained for this activity where all participants able to operate the elektroplatingprocess with excellent result."
