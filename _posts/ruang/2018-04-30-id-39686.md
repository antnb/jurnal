## Abstract:
"Global development contains a major paradox. On the one hand it tends towards a uniformity in capitalist economics (state neo-corporatism, increasing commodification of public assets, informational monopolies etc), but on the other to a diversity of social forms that rise above traditional cultures and practices. Globalisation therefore has its own culture and communities generated by production and diffusion of electronic information (Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, WhatsApp, professional and educational networks etc). While this context exists across space it is not fundamentally place based like local communities where people raise their children, create social networks based on material needs and worship their gods. There exists an uneasy tension between these two events, the space based electronic culture and the place based communal culture. Hence the question arises as to whether resistance is either necessary or possible against globalisation which appears to constitute an enduring and irresistible force. Is it possible to guarantee both cultural forms, or is one (the global) destined to exterminate the other? If so how can this be prevented? Local cultures are also faced with their own internal dynamics, usually tending towards stasis, e.g Ajeg Bali movement taking place in Bali Island. But cultures that do not adapt and develop are threatened with extinction. The fundamental difference between the global and the local lies in their structure. Globalisation is fundamentally an economic form that derives its organisation from the ideological tenets of capitalism. Local cultures derive theirs from tradition, religion, social relations, and language. There are clearly a plethora of responses to these questions. For example is a third culture possible, one that merges the best of both systems, the space based and the place based urban life? Other questions follow. ‘Can there ever be “the best of both worlds”? in which case what is to be sacrificed from each social form? Given that capitalism as a system is largely out of control and has no moral core, no bargain seems likely or reasonable, at least from the local to the global. In addition, arguing logically against the seduction of the capitalist system seems pointless – we all want new cars, jobs, clothes and more significantly, our desires fulfilled in a world where needs have largely been transcended. Contextualizing its fifth volume of publication within this context, Journal Ruang-Space offers eight articles. The first one is by Dwi Ely Wardani and M. Sani Roychansyah entitled Inklusivitas Jalur Pedestrian Di Sekitar Kampus Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta, Studi Kasus Penggal Jln. A.Yani, Jln.
