## Abstract:
"The thesis is simple. Due to the ambiguous interpretations of sustainability (each enterprise interpreting the word in their own way) - there can be no significant explanation of the term outside a theory of capital accumulation. With its absorption by the market, the term sustainable has been elevated to sublime uselessness. It has become a totally politicized ideology anointed with anodyne qualities. Paradoxically, these very qualities are invaluable to the reproduction of capital. It bleats we are all together in this battle against climate change, pollution, and the destruction of natural resources. Populations throughout the developed world have rallied to the cause, providing subliminal cover for corporate rape and pillage to continue as usual. So the term sustainability allows the deepening of capitalist social relations chameleon properties, obscuring the fact that scarcity is not a problem of nature but of politics. Neo-Darwinism rules. No corporation will voluntarily sacrifice market share to sustainable practices. No nation will willingly sacrifice gross development product for the greater good. And no politician will sacrifice votes to their moral conscience. As Nicolas Sarkozy recently said ‘we know what to do, we just don’t know how to get re-elected if we do it’. Consequently economic growth measured as GDP will likely ‘tank the biosphere’ and only the rich will afford to live sustainably (Monbiot). The causes of this global problem are clear. Nature has its own laws. But the neo-corporate state has adopted a mechanistic concept of nature which only recognizes its instrumental value within the market system. This allows corporations free reign to fly the flag of patriotism and benevolence. The terms green and sustainable now legitimize the very institutions that have bankrupted, polluted and exhausted nature – banks, finance and insurance companies, national and trans-national corporations. Unfortunately nature does not yield to the market without problems and an unsustainable planet is the result. Clearly, none of this will be solved by insulation bats in Sydney roofs, solar panels, bio-fuelled buses, wind farms in Denmark, or a Toyota Prius in the garage. These are cosmetic fixes for the wealthy, short term forms of penance to assuage individual guilt. The structural problems of the capitalist system remain undiminished.

The first one is composed by I Putu Edy Rapiana, entitled Perubahan Fungsi Spasial sebagai Akibat Perkembangan Pariwisata di Banjar Kedungu, Desa Belalang Kecamatan Kediri, Kabupaten Tabanan (Spatial Changes Resulted from the Tourist Development in Kedungu Neighborhood, Belalang Village, Kediri District, of Tabanan Regency).
