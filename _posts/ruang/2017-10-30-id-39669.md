However, they also provide spaces for socializing, as well as recreational purposes.

The goal of this study is to identify as to how a sense of place attachment emerges between Jalan Danau Tamblingan-Sanur Corridor and visitors who visited public spaces and commercial buildings located along this corridor. It applies quantitative research metode accompanied with various deskriptive explanations. Data was collected by distributing questionnaires to 100 visitors who were selected using an accidental sampling technique. Research findings show that a place attachment in Jalan Danau Tamblingan Corridor reaches the highest level of 60% and the lowest of 40%.
