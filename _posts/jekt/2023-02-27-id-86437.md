The data analysis technique used descriptive statistical analysis and inferential statistical analysis, namely path analysis. The results of the study show that 1) land ownership, education level, and work culture have a positive effect on productivity, 2) land ownership area, education level, work culture, and productivity have a positive effect on income, and 3) land ownership area, indirectly does not directly affect income through productivity, while the level of education, and work culture indirectly affect income through productivity. Local governments are expected to strive to produce agricultural innovations to support land productivity and become a driving force in the agricultural sector, especially rubber.
