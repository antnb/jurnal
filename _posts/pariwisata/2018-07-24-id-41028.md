This research uses descriptive qualitative analysis technique by applying the participatory principle involving M.I.C.E stakeholders, destination manager, travel agent managers and tourists. Ubud Village as a tourist destination also has potential for M.I.C.E activities has not had a convention bureau, this is due to the characteristics of the tourists who come to Ubud and the needs required by the tourism industry managers are different from other tourist destinations in Bali such as Badung regency and Denpasar municipality. During this time, the implementation activities of M.I.C.E. dominated by incentives tourism activities (56.57%), exhibitions (31.72%) and meetings (11.71%).
