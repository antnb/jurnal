The students’ writing achievement, critical thinking, and autonomous skills are encouraged in the implementation of these teaching techniques.

The study used observations, student reflection notes, interviews, and documents for data collection. Data were analysed using three-step qualitative data analysis; display of data, reduction educe of data, and conclusions drawing. Data analysis showed that the benefits of peer assessment and self-assessment outweigh the drawbacks, as they can provide students with new knowledge, skills, and understanding of the writing process and student achievement. Peer assessment and self-assessment enable students to gain better experience, making it easier for them to apply and respond to their writing. The study concludes that English teachers are recommended to implement these teaching techniques in facilitating the students to fully experience their writing process and to boost the students’ writing ability.
