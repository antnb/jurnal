## Authors:
Vidia Ayundhari

## Abstract:
"Christina Rossetti and Sapardi Djoko Damono are two poets born in different nationalities. Both mostly drew simple poems using natural objects, such as wind. The wind as a symbol of poem writing seems more appealing towards the poets and also the readers to interpret. The paper discusses several poems involved wind as an element on Rossetti’s work. It also analyses “Angin 3” by Damono."
