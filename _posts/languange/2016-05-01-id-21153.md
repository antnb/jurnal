## Abstract:
"This study focuses on finding out the aspects of language being interfered and the factorswhich caused those interferences in the English article ‘About Bali’ published on the officialwebsite of Bali Government Tourism Office. It is found that the interferences in terms ofsemantics in which the writer/translator’s word choices were interfered by the lexicalmeaning without considering the grammatical context of the sentence where those particularwords are places. Besides, the copula ‘are’ was missing in one of the sentences which causedthe meaning of the sentence become incomplete. The uses of singular and plural markers arenot consistent. These interferences are caused by the influence of Indonesian languagemastered by the writer/translator that showed the lack of knowledge regarding the rules ofboth English and Indonesian languages, meaning of words that were chosen, the directtranslation from Indonesian into English which affected the structure, word choices and themeaning in the target language."
