One of its signature activities is called Denpasar Festival. This article focused on examining the role of Denpasar Festival as a sustainable cultural festival to reflect Denpasar as a creative city. The method used is a literature study using journals related to Denpasar festival, sustainable festival and creative city.The results of this study showed that Denpasar Festival plays a significant role in the development and preservation of culture and tourism in Denpasar City. The application of Tri Hita Karana values is a good guideline for Denpasar Festival to become a sustainable festival. Reflecting on the Denpasar Festival, Denpasar City has great potential to become a culture-based creative city. Moreover, Denpasar has a historical and cultural background, as well as creative human resources, so Denpasar City is very capable of fulfilling the criteria for Creative City development."
