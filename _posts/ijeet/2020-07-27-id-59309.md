## Abstract:
"A database can consist of numerical and non-numerical attributes. However, several data processing algorithms, such as K-means clustering, can be used only in a dataset with numerical attributes. Data generalization by using Naïve Bayes and K-means clustering methods is usually employed WEKA (Waikato environment for knowledge analysis) application. Although the strength of WEKA lies in increasingly complete and sophisticated algorithms, the success of data mining still lies in the knowledge factor of the human implementer. The task of collecting high-quality data and knowledge of modeling and the use of appropriate algorithms is needed to guarantee the accuracy of the expected formulations. In this paper, we propose a simple web-based application that can be used like WEKA. The methodology used in this study includes several stages. The first stage is the preparation of data, which is the tic-tac-toe game dataset that is converted to CSV (comma-separated values) format. The next stage is the process of modifying data from non-numeric to numeric, specifically for clustering with the K-means algorithm. Afterward, the calculation of the distance between data is conducted and followed by data clustering. The final stage is the summary of these processes and results. From the experimental results, it was found that clustering can be done on categorical attributes that are transformed first into the numerical form using web-based applications."
