In the existing business process in STMIK STIKOM Bali is divided into three processes that include the process of borrowing vehicles, operational process, vehicle maintenance process. In this paper we discuss the design of vehicle asset management information system on STMIK STIKOM Bali. The design of this proposed system will be web based using PIECES analysis. Vehicle tracking and reminder system on vehicle asset management becomes one of the features in this system design. For system development using System Development Life Cycle method.
