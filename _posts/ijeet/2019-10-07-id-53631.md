However, the process of making the report is still done through manual calculations, causing it to become an obstacle in the data processing and reporting process. In this study, the process of developing a Data center data warehouse at Z Bali Clinic Using the Kimball Nine-Step Method, where the data warehouse can be used as a center for processing and analyzing outpatient visit data, and to produce reports that can facilitate the executive in analyzing data on outpatient visits as consideration in making decisions at the Z Bali Clinic."
