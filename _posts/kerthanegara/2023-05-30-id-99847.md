## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Keputusan Majelis Hakim Tipikor Nomor 36/Pidsus TPK/2020/PN.Jkt.Pst. Pemerintah DKI Jakarta memberhentikan secara tidak horamat pada siapa saja oknum Pegawai Negeri Sipil karena secara sah terbuki melakukan korupsi. Tri Prasetyo Utomo tergolong melakukan kejahatan maka dari itu saudara Tri Prasetyo Utomo dierhentikan secara tidak hormat. Putusan hakim tersebut menjadi bukti dalam penegakan hukum yang pasti dan bermanfaat serta adil. Keberatan pemberhentian seharusnya diajukan banding administratif kepada Badan Pertimbangan ASN melalui Badan Pertimbangan Pegawai namun ASN yang diberhentikan tersebut mengajukan banding langsung ke PTUN, berkaitan dengan itu prosedur yang telah tersedia tidak dilaksanakan dengan tepat. Pejabat Pembina Kepegawaian atau yang lebih dikenal dengan PPK merupakan pejabat yang mempunyai wewenang pada bidang menetapkan dalam pengangkatan, dalam hal pemindahan dan juga pada pemberhentian Pegawai ASN pada instansii pemerintahan sesuai dengan peraturran perundang-undangan yang berlaku. Dalam upaya penyampaian keberatan dapat ditempuh melalui jalur hukum dengan upaya banding administratif dan diajukan dengan prosedur yang telah ditentukan .
