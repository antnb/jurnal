## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui perlindungan hukum pemutusan hubungan kerja secara sepihak dalam putusan dan pendapat majelis hakim pada Putusan Nomor:10/Pdt.Sus-PHI/2020/PN-Dps. PHK secara sepihak tidak boleh dilakukan karena hanya satu pihak saja yang diuntungkan dan pihak yang lain merasa di rugikan. Metode penelitian jurnal ini yaitu penelitian hukum normatif dengan menggunakan pendekatan kasus dan pendekatan undang-undang. Pendekatan kasus pada jurnal ini berpedoman ataupun mengacu pada putusan pengadilan. Jadi jurnal ini mengambil rumusan masalah bagaimana suatu perlindungan hukum pemutusan hubungan kerja secara sepihak terhadap pekerjanya berdasarkan Putusan Nomor 10/Pdt.Sus-PHII/2020/PN-Dps dan bagaimana pertimbangan hak pekerja yang di dapat pemutusan hubungan kerjanya secara sepihak berdasarkan Putusan Nomor 10/Pdt.Sus-PHI/2020/PN-Dps. Salah satu kasus yang unik untuk dibahas, Yayasan GMISB berselisih ataupun melawan KMB. KMBP Sebagai pekerja 21 tahun leih mengajar menjadi guru hanya mendapat perpanjangan kontrak. Penggugat atau Yayasan GMISB mendalilkan tergugat telah melakukan PHK secara sepihak dengan memaksa penggugat untuk mengundurkan diri, sementara tergugat mendalilkam penggugat telah mengundurkan diri melalui wasthapp. Pada faktanya penggugat tidak pernah menandatangani surat pengunduran diri yang draftnya di buat oleh tergugat. 21 tahun lebih penggugat sama sekali tidak pernah mendapatkan surat peringatan. Penggugat tidak lagi di perkenankan memasuki areal kerjanya atau kata lain di pandang sebagai bentuk pemutusan hubungan kerja secara sepihak. Majelis hakim dalam Putusan Nomor 10/Pdt.Sus-PHI/2020/PN-Dps mengabulkan hak pekerja yang di PHK secara sepihak dengan mendapatkan ganti rugi sebesar Rp.1.196.000.000. Kata kunci: Pemutusan Hubungan Kerja, Perusahan, Sepihak ABSTRACT The purpose of this journal is none other than to obtain legal knowledge, especially labor law, to know the legal protection of unilateral termination of employment against the decisions and opinions of the panel of judges Decision Number: 10 / Pdt.Sus-PHI / 2020 / PN-Dps. Unilateral layoffs should not be carried out because only one party benefited and the other party felt that they were disadvantaged, the method was clarified as a normative research journal, court case approach and legal approach. The approach to this journal case is guided by or refers to the verdict. Sothis journal takes the formulation of the problem of how a legal protection for the unilateral termination of employment for workers based on Decision Number 10 / Pdt.Sus-PHII / 2020 / PN-Dps and how to consider the rights of workers who get unilateral termination of employment based on Decision Number 10 /Pdt.Sus-PHI/2020/PN-Dps.
