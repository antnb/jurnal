## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Studi ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui terkait kekuatan hukum dalam perjanjian kredit di bawah tangan dalam lembaga perbankan. Metode penulisan dalam artikel ini menggunakan jenis penelitian hukum nornatif dengan menggunakan pendekatan perundang-undangan dan konseptual. Hasil studi menunjukkan bahwa pihak bank selaku kreditur dalam pemberian kredit kepada nasabah selaku debitur dapat dilakukan dengan cara perjanjian kredit dibawah tangan. Namun, perjanjian kredit di bawah tangan terhadap kekuatan hukumnya juga tetap mengikat para pihak antara kreditur dan debitur. Perjanjian di bawah tangan jika dilihat dari kekuatan hukumnya, maka tergantung terhadap pengakuan para pihak bersangkutan “debitur maupun kreditur” terhadap kebenaran isi maupun tanda tangan yang telah disetujui terkait perjanjian tersebut. Namun kelemahannya, para pihak mungkin saja dapat membenarkan maupun memungkiri tanda tangannya. Perjanjian di bawah tangan dapat disebut memiliki pembuktian secara lahir, jika pihak yang menandatanganinya mengakui telah menandatangani perjanjian tersebut, maka terhadap perjanjian itu merupakan bukti sempurna dan berlaku bagi para pihak yang menandatangani. Perjanjian di bawah tangan memiliki kekuatan pembuktian secara formil, jika para pihak yang telah menandatangani perjanjian tersebut mengakui tanda tangannya. Menurut KUHPerdata pada Pasal 1875, menegaskan “perjanjian di bawah tangan yang diakui secara pembuktian materiil oleh para pihak yang menandatangani dan merupakan bukti sempurna sama seperti akta otentik, sedangkan bagi Hakim perjanjian di bawah tangan terhadap pihak ketiga memiliki kekuatan pembuktian yang bebas.” Kata Kunci: Kekuatan Hukum, Perjanjian Kredit, Perjanjian Bawah Tangan. ABSTRACT This study aims to determine the legal power of underhanded credit agreements in banking institutions. The writing method in this article uses normative legal research using statutory and conceptual approach. The results of the study show that the bank as a creditor in offering credit to customers as debtors can be done by means of an underhand credit agreement. However, the credit agreement under the hand against its legal force also binds the parties between the creditor and the debtor. An underhand agreement if viewed from its legal force, it depends on the acknowledgment of the parties related to the “debtor and creditor” of the correctness of the contents and signatures that have been approved by the agreement. However, the weakness in that the parties may be able to confirm or deny the signature. An underhand agreement can have outward proof, if the recognized party has been called the agreement, then the agreement is perfect evidance and applies to the parties involved. An underhand agreement has the power of formal proof, if the parties recognizing the acknowledment receive a sugnature. According to the Civil Code in Article 1875, it is stated that “a private agreement which is recognized as material evidance by the parties which is parfect evidance is the same as an authentic deed, while of judges, a third underhand agreement has free evidentiary power.” Key Words: Legal Force, Credit Agreement, Underhand Agreement."
