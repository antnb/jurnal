## Abstract:
"Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui bagaimana bentuk pengawasan yang dilakukan pemerintah atas dasar adanya Peraturan Daerah Provinsi Bali Nomor 1 Tahun 2010 serta bertujuan untuk mengetahui bagaimana penerapan pendaftaran izin usaha pariwisata di Bali. Analitis regulasi daerah tersebut hanya diatur mengenai usaha kunjungan wisata yang mencangkup biro kunjungan wisata saja. Masyarakat di Provinsi Bali mendirikan dan menjalankan usaha mereka tanpa adanya izin atau TDUP (Tanda Daftar Usaha Pariwisata). Kurangnya pemahaman masyarakat akan pentingnya pendaftaran izin usaha tersebut menyebabkan pelaksanaan pajak daerah terhambat, maka dilihat dari kacamata penulis terdapat kekaburan norma dimana seharusnya pemerintah daerah Provinsi Bali membuat peraturan mengenai norma yang mengatur serta sanksinya berkaitan dengan usaha pariwisata, prosedur dan tata cara pendaftaran izin usaha di bidang pariwisata, serta sanksi bagi yang tidak mendafarkan usaha di bidang pariwisata. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode normatif adalah dengan menggunakan dan mengkaji peraturan-peraturan terkait dengan penelitian serta menggunakan pendekatan terhadap sumber data yang ada sesuai fakta yang diperoleh dan melakukan kajian terhadap pendukung dalam penulisan ini. Hasil dari penelitian ini dapat menunjukkan bahwa masyarakat banyak yang enggan untuk memiliki izin usaha pariwisata dan pemerintah juga kurang efektif dalam melakukan pengawasan terhadap pelaku usaha di bidang pariwisata. Pemerintah dan masyarakat sebaikanya mampu saling mengawasi agar terlaksana pendaftaran izin dalam berusaha di bidang pariwisata. Kata Kunci : Pariwisata, Izin Usaha Pariwisata, Pengawasan This study aims to determine how the form of supervision by the government on the basis of existence on Bali Provincial Regulation Number 1 of 2010. In provincial regulation, it’s only regulated about tourism business, such as travel agentThey create and run their businesses without permission or TDUP (Tanda Daftar Usaha Pariwisata; which is translated to Business Tourism Registration Sign). The lack of people’s understanding regarding the importance of business permit registration causes the implementation of taxation being hampered. Therefore, from the writer’s eyes, there is a vague norm in which the Bali Government should’ve issued a regulation that regulates norms and their penalties that is related to tourism business, the procedure and how to register a tourism business permit in the tourism sector, and also the penalties for those who don’t register their businesses in tourism sector. Even though there is a Provincial Regulation Number 1 of 2010, but in that regulation there are still many illegal tourism businesses that are developing in Bali today and they are still going along without any incriminating penalty. This research is using normative method that uses data sources , norms approach, and supporting literatures for this research. The government and the community should be able to supervise each other in order to carry out registration of permits in business in the field of tourism. The results of this study can show that many people are reluctant to have a tourism business license and the government is also less effective in conducting surveillance of business actors in the tourism sector. The government and the community should be able to supervise each other in order to carry out registration of permits in business in the field of tourism. Key Words : Tourism, Tourism Business Permit, Supervision"
