## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Tujuan studi ini untuk mengkaji tentang urgensi pengajuan izin usaha gadai kepada otoritas jasa keuangan di masa pandemi covid-19. Studi ini menggunakan metode penelitian hukum normatif dengan pendekatan perundang-undangan dan pendekatan konseptual. Hasil studi menjelaskan bahwa usaha gadai di Indonesia mengalami peningkatan yang sangat signifikan di masa covid-19. Hal tersebut dikarenakan banyaknya masyarakat pemilik usaha yang mengalami kemacetan ekonomi dikarenakan pandemi Covid-19, namun peningkatan usaha gadai tersebut berbanding terbalik dengan usaha gadai yang sah memiliki ijin dari Otoritas Jasa Keuangan. Padahal dalam pengendalian tersebut, Pemerintah dalam hal ini Otoritas Jasa Keuangan telah berupaya untuk menindak tegas terhadap usaha gadai yang ilegal serta berupaya mendorong usaha gadai untuk mendaftarkan serta mengajukan permohonan izin ke pihak Otoritas Jasa Keuangan. Namun dari hasil studi ditemukan beberapa kendala berkaitan dengan masih adanya usaha gadai yang belum mengajukan izin usaha kepada otoritas jasa keuangan, salah satunya adalah besarnya modal yang belum bisa dikumpulkan oleh pihak usaha gadai. Meskipun seperti itu Otoritas Jasa Keuangan memiliki kewenangan untuk memberikan tindakan tegas kepada usaha gadai ilegal berupa pencabutan izin usaha. Kata Kunci: Pengajuan Usaha, Gadai, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, Covid-19. ABSTRACT The purpose of this study is to examine the urgency of applying for a pawn business license to the financial services authority during the covid-19 pandemic. This study uses normative legal research methods with a statutory approach and conceptual approach. In this study resulted in that pawn business in Indonesia experienced a very significant increase in the period of covid-19. This is due to the large number of business owners who experience economic congestion due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but the increase in pawn business is inversely proportional to the pawn business that legally has a license from the Financial Services Authority. Whereas in the control, the Government in this case the Financial Services Authority has attempted to crack down firmly on illegal pawn businesses and seeks to encourage pawn businesses to register and apply for a permit to the Financial Services Authority. But from the results of the study found some obstacles related to there are still pawn businesses that have not applied for a business license to the financial services authority, one of which is the amount of capital that can not be collected by the pawn business. Although such the Financial Services Authority has the authority to give decisive action to illegal pawn businesses in the form of revocation of business licenses. Keywords: Business Submission, Mortgage, Financial Services Authority, Covid-19."
