## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Tujuan studi ini ialah untuk mengidentifikasi serta mengkaji berbagai bentuk regulasi yang berlaku pada Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) mengenai fungsi pengaturan dan pengawasan terhadap produk asuransi Unit link serta menganalisis peran dari OJK terhadap Underlying Investment dari produk asuransi Unit Link. Studi ini sendiri memakai metode penelitian hukum berupa pendekatan hukum normatif kualitatif yakni berbentuk studi hukum dengan melibatkan berbagai jenis kajian bahan pustaka sehingga menghasilkan kesimpulan bersifat deskriptif analitis. Dari hasil studi menunjukkan bahwa munculnya berbagai perusahaan asuransi memiliki dampak semakin beragamnya jenis produk polis asuransi yang semakin tidak terkendali pengaturan dan pengawasannya. Terbukti sepanjang triwulan pertama tahun 2021, OJK telah menerima pengaduan terkait salah satu jenis produk asuransi yaitu asuransi berbasis investasi (PAYDI) yang sering juga dikenal dengan sebutan Unit Link sebanyak 273 kasus. Hal tersebut disebabkan tidak terlaksananya prinsip kehati-hatian perusahaan asuransi perihal kemampuan likuiditas portofolio investasi sehingga mengalami Underlying Investment. Sesuai dengan fungsi OJK yaitu melakukan pengaturan dan pengawasan, maka perlu dilakukan pembaharuan terhadap regulasi industri asuransi Unit Link yang sudah tertinggal perkembangan yang ada. Kata Kunci: Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, Asuransi, PAYDI, Unit Link, Underlying Investment. ABSTRACT The purpose of this study is to identify and examine various forms of regulations that apply to the Financial Services Authority (OJK) regarding the function of regulation and supervision of Unit Link insurance products and to analyze the role of OJK in the Underlying Investment of Unit Linked insurance products. This study itself uses a legal research method in the form of a qualitative normative legal approach, namely in the form of a legal study involving various types of literary studies to produce descriptive-analytical conclusions. The results of the study show that the emergence of various insurance companies has the impact of increasing the variety of insurance policy products, which are increasingly uncontrollable in their regulation and supervision. It is proven that throughout the first quarter of 2021, OJK has received complaints about one type of insurance product, namely investment-based insurance (PAYDI), which is often known as Unit Link as many as 273 cases. This is due to the non-implementation of the prudential principle of insurance companies regarding the placement of investment portfolio liquidity, resulting in an underlying investment. Following the function of the OJK, which is to regulate and supervise, it is necessary to update the Unit Link insurance industry regulations which are already lagging in existing developments. Keywords: Financial Services Authority, Insurance, PAYDI, Unit Link, Underlying Investment."
