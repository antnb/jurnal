## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Penulisan ini dilakukan untuk menganalisis mengenai dasar hukum dan implementasi serta efektivitas dari perjanjian ekstradisi antara Amerika Serikat dan Meksiko dalam menanggulangi fenomena perang narkoba di Meksiko. Penulisan ini dilakukan dengan metode penelitian normatif dengan menggunakan pendekatan perundang-undangan yang mengacu pada perjanjian ekstradisi antara Amerika Serikat dan Meksiko. Berdasarkan pada hasil studi normatif yang dilakukan telah diketahui bahwa, praktik esktradisi yang digunakan sebagai langkah penanganan Mexican Drug War dilakukan berdasarkan perjanjian international bilateral antara Amerika Serikat dan Meksiko sebagai dasar hukum yang mengikat antara dua belah pihak. Lebih lanjut, dalam implementasinya, perjanjian ekstradisi yang dilakukan nampak telah berhasil dilakukan untuk menjerat para pemimpin Drug Trafficking Organization. Namun dalam jangka panjang, efektivitas praktik ekstradisi masih belum kuat untuk menghentikan fenomena Mexican Drug War dengan munculnya penerus dari para pemimpin yang telah di ekstradisi. Kata Kunci: Ekstradisi, Perang Narkoba, Kejahatan Narkotika Internasional, Kerjasama AS-Meksiko ABSTRACT This writing was conducted to analyze the legal basis as well as the implementation and effectiveness of the extradition treaty between the United States of Amerca and Mexico in tackling the Drug War phenomenon in Mexico. This study was carried out using a normative research method with the constitutional approach which refers to the extradition treaty between the United States of America and Mexico. Based on the result of the normative study conducted, it was found that the extradition practice used as a measure to handle the Mexican Drug War was carried out based on a bilateral agreement between the United States and Mexico as a binding legal basis between the two of the parties. Furthermore, in its implementation, the extradition treaty has been successfully conducted to ensnare the leaders of the Drug Trafficking Organization. However, in the long term, the effectiveness of the practice of extradition is still not strong enough to stop the Mexican Drug War phenomenon with the emergence of new leaders to replaced the former leaders who have been extradited. Keywords: Extradition, Drug War, International Narcotics Crimes, USA-Mexico Cooperation"
