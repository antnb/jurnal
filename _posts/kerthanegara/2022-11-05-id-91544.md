## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menelaah Pilkada Serentak Tahun 2020 banyak menuai problematika bagi pemerintah maupun masyarakat. Hal ini disebabkan karena pandemi Covid-19 yang melanda sehingga tingkat partisipasi masyarakat dalam menggunakan hak pilihnya menjadi menurun. Wabah pandemi Covid-19 telah mengancam kesehatan masyarakat dan memberikan dampak terhadap agenda demokrasi di Indonesia. Oleh karena itu, penulis tertarik dalam melakukan penelitian, supaya mengetahui bagaimana hak pilih masyarakat dalam Pilkada Serentak Tahun 2020 sebagai pelaksanaan hak konstitusional warga negara. Pada penelitian ini digunakan metode penelitian yuridis empiris, sifat penelitiannya ialah deskriptif menggunakan sumber data sekunder berupa bahan hukum primer, sekunder dan tersier. Pengumpulan data dengan menggunakan studi kepustakaan yang dirangkum dalam analisis kualitatif. Jenis penelitian yang digunakan ialah penelitian hukum empiris. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa Pilkada Serentak Tahun 2020 mengantisipasi bahwa pelaksanaannya tidak dilakukan dalam keadaan yang normal, sehingga harus mempersiapkan pelaksanaan dengan mematuhi protokol kesehatan Covid-19. Dengan adanya Perppu No. 2 Tahun 2020 yang telah ditetapkan menjadi Undang-Undang No.6 Tahun 2020 telah memberikan kepastian hukum akan pelaksanaan Pilkada tahun 2020 saat pandemi Covid-19 itu artinya pemerintah menyokong pelaksanaan Pilkada langsung secara lazim, sehingga dapat diapresiasi bahwa pemerintah berusaha merealisasikan hak konstitusional warga negara dengan penyelenggaraan pilkada. Tetapi, hal yang bisa digaris bawahi adalah terwujudnya hak-hak berupa hak memilih, hak hidup, dan hak memperoleh kesehatan ialah hak asasi manusia (HAM). Untuk mencapai itu semua pemerintah harus menetapkan protokol kesehatan Covid-19 sesuai dengan UU Covid-19 atau secara tegas pada pelaksanaan Pilkada Serentak.
