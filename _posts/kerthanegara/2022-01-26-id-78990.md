## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Penghindaran pajak berganda atau Tax Treaty ialah perjanjian pajak melalui 2 negara yang mengurus perihal yang berhubungan atas pemisahan hak perpajakan berdasarkan pendapatan yang didapat oleh masyarakat dari salah satu atau kedua sisi negara dengan tujuan mencegah adanya pengenaan pajak berganda guna mengambil penanaman dana luar negeri menuju dalam negeri. Skema Treaty Shopping adalah sebuah modus penghindaran pajak berganda, dimana penggunaan tax treaty oleh orang yang bukan resident (subjek pajak dalam negeri) dari kedua negara mitra tax treaty, biasanya melalui pembentukan perusahaan cangkang (conduit) di salah satu negara mitra tax treaty tersebut. Dalam perkembangannya, skema penghindaran pajak terus bertumbuh, adanya ruang dalam peraturan perundang-undangan sebagai suatu celah yang hanya mampu dibuat oleh badan korporasi selaku wajib pajak badan. Pokok permasalahan dalam kajian ini adalah pada hakekatnya Tax Treaty dibuat untuk menghindari terjadinya tindak pidana penghindaran pajak berganda, namun dalam pemberlakuannya terdapat celah yang justru sering kali digunakan untuk melakukan tindak pidana penghindaran pajak berganda itu sendiri. Tujuan penulisan karya tulis ini adalah untuk mengetahui tingkat keefektivitasan Peraturan Direktur Jendral Pajak Nomor Per-25/PJ/2010 Tentang Pencegahan Penyalahgunaan Persetujuan Penghindaran Pajak Berganda dalam menyikapi modus penghindaran pajak terutama modus penghindaran pajak berganda dengan skema Treaty Shopping. Kajian ini memakai metode penelitian hukum normatif, yang mana kajian ini menggunakan pendekatan perundang-undangan (The Statute Approach). Kesimpulan dari penulisan ini adalah dalam Peraturan Direktur Jendral Pajak Nomor Per-25/PJ/2010 Tentang Pencegahan Penyalahgunaan Persetujuan Penghindaran Pajak Berganda masih terdapat celah hukum yang bisa digunakan oleh wajib pajak untuk melakukan penyalahgunaan penghindaran pajak melalui modus Treaty Shopping. Kata kunci: Penghindaran Pajak Berganda, Treaty Shopping, Pemangkasan Pajak, Manajemen Pajak. ABSTRACT Avoidance of double taxation or Tax Treaty is a tax treaty through 2 countries that manages matters relating to the separation of taxation rights based on income obtained by the community from one or both sides of the country with the aim of preventing the imposition of double taxation in order to take foreign investment into the country. . The Treaty Shopping scheme is a mode of double taxation avoidance, in which the use of a tax treaty by a non-resident person (domestic tax subject) from both tax treaty partner countries, usually through the establishment of a conduit company in one of the tax treaty partner countries. In its development, the tax avoidance scheme continues to grow, there is room in the legislation as a gap that only corporate entities can make as corporate taxpayers. The main problem in this study is that in essence the Tax Treaty was made to avoid the occurrence of double taxation avoidance, but in its implementation there is a loophole that is often used to commit the crime of double tax avoidance itself. The purpose of writing this paper is to determine the level of effectiveness of the Regulation of the Director General of Taxes Number Per-25/PJ/2010 concerning the Prevention of Misuse of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements in addressing the tax avoidance mode, especially the double tax avoidance mode with the Treaty Shopping scheme. This study uses a normative legal research method, in which this study uses a statutory approach (The Statue Approach). The conclusion of this paper is that in the Director General of Taxes Regulation Number Per-25/PJ/2010 concerning the Prevention of Abuse of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements, there are still legal loopholes that can be used by taxpayers to abuse tax avoidance through the Treaty Shopping mode.
