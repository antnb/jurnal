## Authors:
Dwi Krisna Arjati, Cokorda Dalem Dahana

## Abstract:
"This article discusses various interpretations of the provisions that govern the Most-Favoured Nation Treatment (MFN) obligation in accordance with the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It is a normative legal research that uses instrumental (statutory) and case approaches. This writing concludes that the Panels and Appellate Bodies of the WTO have provided a number of interpretations of the provisions of GATS related to MFN treatment obligations, which later became jurisprudence."
