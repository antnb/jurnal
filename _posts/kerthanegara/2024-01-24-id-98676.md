## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah agar mengetahui bagaimana ketentuan tentang organ pelaksana dalam Perseroan Perorangan di Indonesia serta bagaimana Pertanggungjawaban organ perseroan perorangan jika perseroan pailit. Dalam penelitian ini, metodologi yang gunakan adalah hukum normatif dengan pendekatan peraturan undang-undang sebagai landasan. Pendekatan ini melibatkan pemahaman serta analisis terhadap seluruh peraturan undang-undang yang berkaitan dengan isu yang diteliti dalam penulisan jurnal ini. Hasil studi menunjukkan bahwa Perseroan Perorangan, didirikan dan dijalankan hanya oleh 1 orang, yang juga menjabat posisi direktur sekaligus merangkap sebagai pemegang saham tunggal tanpa adanya komisaris. Hal tersebut dikarenakan Perseroan Perorangan di Indonesia ini menganut sistem yang telah lama dikenal dan dianut oleh negara Anglo Saxon, yaitu disebut dengan one tier system. Selain itu, ketika Perseroan Perorangan di mohonkan pailit, maka direktur bertanggung jawab sebatas harta yang dimiliki Perseroan saja, tidak meliputi harta prbadinya. Namun, jika terbukti bahwa direktur beritikad buruk dalam menggunakan harta kekayaan Perseroan, sehingga berakibat pada tidak cukupnya harta kekayaan Perseroan untuk membayar utangnya, maka direktur harus bertanggungjawab meliputi harta pribadinya atas kepailitan Perseroan Perorangan tersebut. Selain itu, Menurut Peraturan Pemerintah Nomor 8 Tahun 2021, perseroan perorangan wajib menyetorkan laporan terkait kondisi keuangan perseroan setiap tahunnya. Hal tersebut bertujuan untuk menghindari terjadinya penyalahagunaan keuangan perseroan. Dengan begitu kepercayaan publik terhadap pengelolaan bisnis yang dijalankan oleh perseroan perorangan akan selalu terjamin. Namun, yang menjadi permasalahan adalah pengaturan mengenai organ Perseroan Perorangan masih terjadi inkonsisten antara yang diatur dalam PP No. 8/2021 dengan peraturan diatasnya yakni Perppu Cipta Kerja. Kata Kunci: Perseroan Perorangan, Organ Perseroan, Kepailitan, One Tier System, Direktur ABSTRACT The purpose of this study is to examine the laws governing implementing organs in Indonesian individual companies and how their organs' responsibility is applied in bankruptcy. The normative law methodology with a regulatory approach is employed as the foundation of this research. In this approach, all the relevant regulations related to the topic discussed in this paper are comprehensively analyzed and understood. Based on the study results, it was found that the Individual Company in Indonesia, which is established and run by only one person, also holds the position of director and is the sole shareholder without a commissioner. This is because the Individual Company in Indonesia adopts the one-tier system, which is widely used in Anglo-Saxon countries. Moreover, the director's accountability, if the Individual Company goes bankrupt, is limited to the company's assets alone and does not include their personal assets. However, if it is proven that the director acted with malicious intent in utilizing the company's resources, leading to insufficiency in paying off its debts, the director will be held accountable for the bankruptcy of the Individual Company, including their personal assets. Furthermore, according to PP No. 8/2021, an individual company is required to report an annual financial statement. This is to prevent the misuse of company funds. By doing so, public trust in the business management of the individual company will always be maintained. However, the issue is that the regulation regarding the body of the Individual Company is still inconsistent between what is regulated in PP No. 8/2021 and the regulation above it, namely the Perppu Cipta Kerja. Key Words: Individual Company, Company Organ, Bankruptcy, One Tier System, Director"
