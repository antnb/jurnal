## Abstract:
"Di era yang sudah maju ini, kompetisi di bidang sepakbola sudah berubah dikarenakan adanya oknum yang berperan sebagai penjahat terorganisir. Dalam pertandingan sering terjadi upaya manipulasi pertandingan. Ancaman global dalam bidang kompetisi sepakbola dilakukan dengan kecurangan penetapan skor dan manipulasi pertandingan. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui latarbelakang adanya match fixing di dunia sepak bola Indonesia dan untuk mengetahui bagaimana analisis hukum menurut Undang-Undang Nomor 11 Tahun 1980 terhadap tindak pidana match fixing dalam dunia sepakbola di Indonesia. Metode yang digunakan adalah metode hukum normatif. Sumber acuan hukum tersebut didapatkan melalui tinjauan kepustakaan, yang kemudian semua sumber acuan hukum tersebut dianalisis secara kualitatif normatif. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa pengaturan pertandingan di bidang persepakbolaan Indonesia sesuai dengan Undang-Undang Nomor 11 Tahun 1980 tentang kejahatan penyuapan dijatuhkan hukuman pidana walaupun praktek menyuap dalam lingkup swasta bukan dianggap sebagai korupsi. Ada beberapa alasan terjadinya tindak pidana pengaturan skor (match fixing) bisa terjadi, pada umumnya itu karena adanya perjudian serta keuntungan finansial yang berupa uang atau barang-barang mewah lainnya yang dapat menarik perhatian seseorang untuk bisa memanipulasi hasil pertandingan baik dari segi pemalsuan dokumen pemain maupun disogoknya para pemain intuk mengikuti intruksi. Kriminalisasi match fixing di pertandingan dalam dunia persepakbolaan Indonesia diatur dalam UU No. 11 Tahun 1980 dapat diancam dengan sanksi pidana walaupun tindakan suap tidak dapat dikategorikan sebagai tindakan korupsi sesuai dengan UU Tipikor. Kata kunci: Match fixing, sepak bola, pidana. ABSTRACT In this advanced era, competition in football field has changed because there were individuals who succeed as organized criminals.
