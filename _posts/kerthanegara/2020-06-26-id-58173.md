## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Dalam hubungan kerja pada suatu industri tidak menutup kemungkinan terjadi sengketa ataupun perselisihan di antara kedua belah pihak. Sebelum memasuki Pengadilan Hubungan Industrial, suatu perselisihan antara pekerja dengan pengusaha harus menjalani proses bipartit dan jika gagal maka harus menjalani proses tripartite dan jika belum mendapatkan kesepakatan antara kedua belah pihak, maka baru mendapatkan rujukan oleh Dinas Tenaga Kerja sebagai tiket masuk kedalam Pengadilan Hubungan Industrial di kabupaten/kota tempat pekerjaan dilaksakan. Tujuan dari penulisan karya tulis ini adalah untuk menganalisis alternatif penyelesaian sengketa pekerja outsourcing khususnya secara mediasi. Permasalahan yang diangkat pada jurnal ini meliputi apakah Undang-Undang No 2 Tahun 2004 dapat dijadikan dasar hukum dalam penyelesaian perselisihan outsourcing serta menjelaskan kedudukan/karakteristik mediasi dalam penyelesaian perselisihan outsourcing. Metode yang digunakan dalam jurnal ini adalah metode penelitian hukum normatif. Dalam UU No 2 Tahun 2004 terdapat kekosongan norma hukum yakni Perselisihan Hubungan Industrial dikatakan sebagai perbedaan pendapat yang mengakibatkan pertentangan antara pengusaha dengan pekerja dalam satu perusahan, kekosongan norma hukum mengenai mediasi yang disebutkan merupakan penyelesaian perselisihan industrial hanya dalam satu perusahaan melalui musyawarah yang ditengahi oleh satu mediator yang netral. Perlu diketahi bahwa terdapat kekosongan norma dalam Undang-Undang No 2 Tahun 2004 di mana apabila interpretasikan hanya memfasilitasi perselisihan antara pekerja dengan dua perusahaan. Agar suatu perkara dalam perselisihan hubungan industrial dapat mencapai suatu perdamaian, dibutuhkan mediator yang berkompeten dalam melaksanakan proses mediasi sebagai penengah yang mampu menyelesaikan masalah. Kata Kunci: Mediasi, Perselisihan Hubungan Industrial, Outsourcing ABSTRACT In a work relationship of an industry does not rule out the possibility of disputes especially disputes between the two parties. Before entering the Industrial Relations Court, a dispute between the worker and company must get through a bipartite process first and if it fails then it must get through a tripartite process and if it has not yet reached an agreement between the two parties, then just get a reference by the Mediator as an entry ticket to the Industrial Relations Court at district / city where the work is carried out. The problem raised in this journal include whether Law No. 2/2004 can be used as a legal basis for resolving outsourcing disputes and clarifying the position / characteristics of mediation in resolving outsourcing disputes. The method used in this journal is the normative legal research method. In Satute No 2 year 2004 there is a norm legal vacuum in which Industrial Relations Disputes are said to be differences of opinion resulting in conflict between employers and workers in only one company, and the norm legal vacuum regarding mediation mentioned is the settlement of industrial disputes in only one company through deliberations mediated by one company neutral mediator. The purpose of writing this paper is to analyze the alternatives of dispute resolution of workers, especially in mediation. It should be noted that there are empty norm in the Statute No. 2 of 2004 which when interpreted only facilitate disputes between workers and two companies. In ordet to achieve peace in industrial dispute, a competent mediator is needed in the mediation process as an intermediary who is able to resolve the problem. Keywords: Mediation, Industrial Relation Dispute, Outsourcing."
