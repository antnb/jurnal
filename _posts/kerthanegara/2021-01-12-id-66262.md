## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Pembangunan merupakan hal yang wajar terjadi bagi kelangsungan hidup manusia, terlebih bagi negara berkembang seperti Indonesia, namun pada saat yang bersamaan pembangunan tersebut menimbulkan dampak negatif terhadap perlindungan dan pemeliharaan lingkungan hidup, seperti tindakan deforestasi yang masif akan pengalihan guna fungsi lahan dari hutan menjadi perkebunan kawasan industri, hal ini di perparah dengan dihapusnya asas strict liability dalam Undang-undang Cipta Kerja atau Omnibus Law yang dirasa dapat mengancam keberlangsungan lingkungan hidup karena pelanggaran-pelanggaran terhadap lingkungan akan terus bertambah seiring dengan pembukaan usaha-usaha korporasi baru menyangkut pekebunan kawasan industri. Asas strict liability yang terkandung dalam Pasal 88 Undang-Undang No. 32 Tahun 2009 sudah cukup menguatkan untuk menjerat para korporasi yang melakukan pelanggaran terhadap lingkungan, dengan tidak adanya asas tersebut dalam Omnibus Law. Tulisan ini bertujuan untuk mengkaji dua undang-undang, sebelumnya dan yang telah disahkan sehingga dapat diketahui aturan-aturan yang terkandung dalam suatu undang-undang berpengaruh terhadap masyarakat dan lingkungan di sekitarnya, terlebih dalam kaitannya mengenai masif deforestasi di Indonesia. Metodelogi yang digunakan adalah metode penulisan hukum normatif agar dapat ditemukannya aturan ataupun doktrin hukum dalam menjawab permasalahan yang sedang dihadapi. Hasil penelitian menunjukan bahwa perubahan substansi frasa pada Omnibus Law terdapat 2 hasil yang dapat disampaikan dari penulisan ini, pertama, pengubahan frasa dari UU No. 32 Tahun 2009 ke Omnibus Law mencederai niat pemerintah Indonesia dalam menjaga lingkungan karena meniadakan asas strict liability sehingga korporasi nakal tidak dapat kembali terjerat, kedua, dari penghapusan asas tersebut terdapat dampak yang tidak bisa kita hindari, yaitu akan terjadinya deforestasi secara masif di daerah-daerah berpotensi yang kemudian akan digunakan sebagai perkebunan kawasan industri. Kata Kunci: Omnibus Law, Strict Liability, Deforestasi ABSTRACT The gross development of a country is a natural things for human life whitstand, particularly for developing country as Indonesia. However, at the same time these development has a negative impact on environmental protection and preservation, as an example of massive deforestation, it will change the use of land from forest to plantation areas indusrty, this impact was exacerbated by the elimination of the principle of a strict liability in the Job Creation Act or Omnibus Law which was considered to be threatening the sustainability of the environment, for the reason violations against the environment will continue to increase along with the opening of new corporate businesses regarding industrial estate plantations. The principle of strict liability as regulate in Article 88 of Law No. 32 of 2009, which sufficient to strengthen to ensnare corporations that violate the environmental protection and preservation, in the absence of that principle in the Omnibus Law, This paper focuses on the comparison of two Act, the Previously one and those that have been ratified. Therefore, it can be seen that the rules contained in the new act have an impact on the sustainability of the environment, especially, in relation to massive deforestation in Indonesia. The methodology is used in this paper is normative legal research methods that aim to find rules or legal doctrine in responding to answer the problems at hand. The result of this research shows that it can be found 2 results that can be conveyed from this paper, firstly, the amandment of the phrase from Law No.32 of 2009 to Omnibus Law injures the intention of Indonesian Government in protecting the environment because it eliminates the principle of strict liability, therefore, the corporations can not be tangled. Secondly, the elimination of its principle there are impact that we cannot avoid, specifically the dofrestation on that massive in some parts of areas which ptotential to be used as industrial estate plantations.
