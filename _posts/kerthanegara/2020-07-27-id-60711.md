## Abstract:
"Abstrak Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia menganut sistem pemerintahan presidensial. Dengan dianutnya sistem pemerintahan presidensial tersebut maka, Presiden diberikan hak prerogatif untuk mengangkat dan memberhentikan personil pemerintahannya. Namun dalam praktiknya presiden seringkali tidak menggunakan hak itu secara penuh. Hal ini dikarenakan adanya pengaruh-pengaruh dari partai politik, sehingga presiden menjadi tidak leluasa ketika memilih figur untuk ditempatkan dalam jabatan politis-strategis pada instansi tertentu. Terdapat 2 tujuan dalam penelitian ini, antara lain: (1) untuk mengetahui dan menganlisis tentang hak prerogatif Presiden sebelum dan sesudah perubahan Undang-Undang Dasar 1945: dan (2) untuk mengetahui dan menganlisis tentang konsekuensi yuridis dari sistem pemerintahan presidensial terhadap hak prerogatif Presiden dalam pengangkatan menteri menurut Undang-Undang Dasar 1945. Metode penelitian yang digunakan pada penelitian ini adalah adalah metode penelitian hukum normatif dengan teknik studi dokumen melalui pendekatan perbandingan mikro (microcomparative approach) yang membandingkan peristiwa-peristiwa yang pernah terjadi dalam satu negara dalam periode waktu tertentu. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian, diketahui bahwa: (1) Sebelum amandemen UUD 1945, beberapa di antara kewenangan presiden yang diatur dalam beberapa pasal merupakan hak prerogatif presiden, yang dapat dilaksanakan sendiri oleh presiden tanpa harus meminta persetujuan atau pertimbangan dari lembaga lain. Namun setelah dilakukannya amandemen terhadap UUD 1945, hampir tidak ada kewenangan presiden yang dapat dilakukan sendiri tanpa meminta persetujuan atau pertimbangan dari lembaga lain, kecuali pengangkatan menteri-menteri sebagaimana diatur dalam Pasal 17 ayat (2) UUD 1945; (2) konsekuensi yuridis penerapan sistem presidensial dalam konteks multipartai terhadap struktur kekuasaan presiden secara eksternal menjadikan tereduksinya hak prerogatif yang dimiliki presiden sehingga presiden tidak bisa mengambil sikap secara bebas dan mandiri. Kata Kunci: Konsekuensi Yuridis, Sistem Presidensial, Hak Prerogratif Abstract The Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia adheres to a presidential system of government. With the adoption of the presidential government system, the President is given a prerogative to appoint and dismiss his government personnel. But in practice the president often does not use that right in full. This is due to the influence of political parties, so that the president is not free when choosing figures to be placed in political-strategic positions in certain institutions. There are 2 objectives in this study, among others: (1) to know and analyze the President's prerogative before and after the amendment to the 1945 Constitution: and (2) to know and analyze the juridical consequences of the presidential government system of the President's prerogative rights in appointing ministers according to the 1945 Constitution. This research was conducted using document study techniques through a microcomparative approach that compares events that have occurred in one country in a certain time period. Based on the research results, it is known that: (1) Prior to the amendment to the 1945 Constitution, some of the presidential authorities stipulated in several articles were the prerogative of the president, which could be carried out by the president himself without having to seek approval or consideration from other institutions. However, after the amendment to the 1945 Constitution, almost no presidential authority can be done alone without asking for approval or consideration from other institutions, except the appointment of ministers as stipulated in Article 17 paragraph (2) of the 1945 Constitution; (2) the juridical consequences of applying a presidential system in a multiparty context to the president's power structure externally makes the prerogative of the president's rights reduced so that the president cannot take a free and independent stance. Keywords: Juridical Consequences, Presidential System, Prerogative Rights"
