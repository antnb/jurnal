With drug resistant emerging, TB will require longer treatment time. According to the WHO report (2013) the results of pulmonary tuberculosis BTA (+) treatment were reported: Year 2010 the number of failure of treatment was (0.53%); Died of TB (3.53%); Drop out of treatment (4.05%); Outmigration (3.98%); In 2011 cases of treatment failure (0.50%) Died of TB (3.36%); Drop out of treatment (3.36%); Outmigration (1.92%); In 2012 cases of treatment failure (1.03%); Died of TB (3.49%) Drop out of treatment (4.59%) and migration, (2.26%).

Results: The correlation test showed a strong positive relationship level if r = 0.51 until +1. Analysis of significance value of r xy = 0.671 and p = 0.000 indicates that there is a significant relationship between the variables of education, job and income with variable discontinuation of treatment. Conclusion: Based on the results of research and data analysis, it can be concluded that the results of this study are as follows: There was a significant relationship between the variables of education, household income, and jobs to the discontinuation of TB treatment."
