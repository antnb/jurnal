## Abstract:
"Background: Hypercholesterolemia can cause oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Anthocyanin can prevent oxidative stress, it will decrease the inflammation by decreasing the pro inflammatory cytokine in animal models. Purple sweet potato in Bali has been proven of having high anthocyanins content. The aim of these study was to prove the ability of aqueous extract of Balinese purple sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) in decreasing the blood interleukin-1 level in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Methods: Subjects of this study were 18 male adult rabbits divided into 3 groups with randomized post test only control group design. Group 1 rabbits were given standard diet as a control group. Group 2 rabbits were given high cholesterol diet. Group 3 rabbits were given aqueous extract of Balinese purple sweet potato 4 ml/Kg.BW/day and high cholesterol diet. After 60 days of treatment, the blood level of total cholesterol, MDA and interleukin- 1 were measured as post test examination. The data were analysed by using anova. Results: The results showed significant increases of blood total cholesterol, MDA, and interleukin-1 in group 2 (p&lt;0.05). In group 3 the increases of blood total cholesterol and MDA levels were sligthly lower than the group 2 (p&lt;0.05). Group 3 also showed significantly lower of blood interleukin-1 levels than those in group 2 (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: From this finding, it can be concluded that aqueous extract of Balinese purple sweet potato can decrease oxidative stress and decrease the level of interleukin-1 in hypercholesterolemic rabbits."
