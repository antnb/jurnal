## Abstract:
"Background: Streptococcus suis infection is a zoonotic disease which cause fatal outbreak. Infection case is related to animal handling and dry season. Health workers on Timor island need to understand more about biosafety procedure and increase awareness of the disease as a potential causes of meningitis. Objective: To provide a simple yet comprehensive reading material for the health workers that is exposed to meningitis. Method: This is a descriptive explorative study, to search about Streptococcus suis in the James Cook University OneSearch library search engine and biosafety procedure in WHO and CDC database. The information in accessed articles were compiled into a review piece. Conclusion: The biggest risk factor for a Streptococcus suis outbreak is inappropriate pig carcass handling. The cocci infect via micro-lesion on the handler skin. Public awareness about an appropriate way to handle meat needed to be raised. Suspected case need to be referred to the nearest centre with an ability to conduct a PCR test. It is essential that people, especially health workers understand that the principles of biosafety cover the basics of the containment system, including the practice, and the correct laboratory techniques, safety equipment, laboratory facilities to protect workers, the environment, and the public from exposure to infectious microorganisms."
