Recent studies suggest that hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Method: One thousand eighty seven patients, attending Nepalgunj medical college and Teaching Hospital, Banke, Nepal from March 2011 to February 2012 were included in this study. The reference range was 3.5 – 7.0 mg/dL in males and 2.6 – 6.0 mg/dL in females. Hyperuricemia was de?ned as a Serum Uric Acid level of more than 7.0 mg/dL in males and of more than 6.0 mg/dL in females. The uric acid was determined by uricase /PAP method. Test was performed in the central laboratory of Biochemistry, Nepalgunj Medical College &amp; teaching Hospital, Banke, Nepal. Results: A number of 1487 studies were selected, the statistical information of which was collected for systematic analysis. The results showed that the high prevalence of hyperuricemia found in females(22.86%) as compare to males(18.98). It was found that 21-40 age group is on high risk for hyperuricemia.Conclusion: The prevalence of hyperuricemia is different as the period of age and it increases after 21-40 years in male and in female. Serum uric acid level was high in female as compare to male."
