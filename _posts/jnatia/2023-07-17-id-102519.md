This study aims to make it easier for coaches to monitor the sleep hours of athletes being mentored. In order to improve the athlete's heart rate monitoring, an application was formed in the form of a prototype. The method used in this study is the mid-fidelity prototype which is the development of a prototype design model. Mid-fidelity prototype is a method for initial design, for purposes after detailed design and usability validation. Keywords: Athlete, Wearable, Prototype"
