The sampling technique used is proportional random sampling. The analytical technique used in this research is Path Analysis. The results of this study are: 1) education, age, and number of dependent children have a positive effect on the outpouring of working hours for women farmers groups in Klungkung Regency; 2) age and number of dependents have no effect, while education and working hours have a positive effect on the productivity of women's farmer groups in Klungkung Regency; and 3) working hours as an intervening variable the effect of education, age and number of dependent children on the productivity of women farmers groups in Klungkung Regency.
