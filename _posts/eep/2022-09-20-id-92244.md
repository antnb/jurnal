In addition, this study aims to determine the most influential variable on tea export value for the period 1993 - 2019 using SPSS. The results of data analysis show that tea quality, export quantity, and exchange rate simultaneously affect the export value of Indonesian tea in 1993 - 2019. The variables of tea quality and export quantity partially have a positive and significant effect on the value of Indonesian tea exports in 1993 - 2019 while the exchange rate variable partially had a negative and significant effect on the value of Indonesian tea exports in 1993 - 2019."
