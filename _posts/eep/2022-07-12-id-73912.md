The data used in this study are secondary data. The analysis technique used in this research is multiple linear regression analysis with the validity test. The test results show that 1) the reference price for palm oil, FDI and the rupiah exchange rate simultaneously have a significant effect on Indonesia's current account balance for 2015, quarter 1 - 2019, quarter 4; 2) the reference price for palm oil and FDI has a positive but insignificant effect on Indonesia's current account balance for 2015, quarter 1 - 2019, quarter 4; 3) The rupiah exchange rate has a significant negative effect on the current account balance in 2015, quarter 1 - 2019, quarter 4.
