## Abstract:
"Competitiveness is the ability of a commodity to enter a foreign market and the ability to survive in that market. Jewelry is one of the commodities that is quite widely exported by Indonesia and also has high competitiveness because of its fluctuating export value for the period 2010 to 2018. This study aims to determine the condition of the competitiveness of Indonesian jewelry in the destination country and the simultaneous and partial influence of GDP per capita of the destination country, the exchange rate, and the destination country inflation on the competitiveness of Indonesian jewelry exports. The data used in this study is panel data, which is a combination of time series data and cross section data. To analyze the competitiveness of Indonesian jewelry in the ten main export destination countries, the RCA (Revealed Comparative Advantage) method is used. RCA values ??for Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, the US, South Africa, India, Italy, and Germany show strong competitiveness, while those for Thailand show weak competitiveness. Based on the results of research with panel data regression analysis techniques, the variable GDP per capita of destination countries, exchange rates, and inflation of destination countries simultaneously have a significant effect on the competitiveness of Indonesian jewelry exports to the main destination countries. Partially, GDP per capita of destination countries has a positive but not significant effect on the competitiveness of Indonesian jewelry. While the exchange rate and inflation of the destination country have a significant effect, with a negative direction on the competitiveness of Indonesian jewelery."
