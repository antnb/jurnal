Meanwhile, partial test shown that the net export of Indonesian marine transportation production influenced by net export variables in four previous quarterly; U.S dollar exchange rate of two, four, seven, and eight previous quarterly; foreign exchange reserves of one, two, and four previous quarterly; and number of loading/unloading goods in the four previous quarterly.
