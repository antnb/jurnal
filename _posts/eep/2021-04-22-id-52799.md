To analyze the effect of exchange rates, FDI and exports partially on Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves. The data used in this study are secondary using multiple linear regression analysis techniques and the classical assumption test. The results show that simultaneous exports, exchange rates, and FDI have a significant effect on Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves. The results of this study mean that the increase in exports, exchange rates and FDI can affect the increasing number of Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves.
