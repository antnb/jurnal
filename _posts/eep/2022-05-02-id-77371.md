The implementation of decentralization reduces the role and contribution of the central government to local governments, so that local governments need to prepare relatively large funds.

The data used is secondary that 45 observations are obtained. The analysis technique used is multiple regression analysis. The results showed that (1) the number of lodging, the number of alcoholic beverage traders, and the number of residents simultaneously had a significant effect on regional levies in the Regency/City in Bali Province, (2) the number of lodging, the number of alcoholic beverage traders, and the number of residents partially affected positive on regional levies in regencies/cities in Bali Province, and (3) the number of lodging is the variable that has the most dominant influence on regional levies in regencies/cities in Bali Province.
