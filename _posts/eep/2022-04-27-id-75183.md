"The high population growth is indeed one of the priority problems that must be addressed immediately, especially in Indonesia. But on the other hand, if the population growth rate is too low it will also have a negative impact on regional development. This problem also needs attention.

This study aims to analyze the effect of push factors (land ownership, education level) and pull factors (income, presence of relatives in the destination area) on leght of migration to Denpasar City. This research uses primary date. The date were collected by means of observation, in-depth interviews, and structured interviews. The analysis technique used in this research is moderation regression analysis. The number of samples taken in this study were 99 respondents, using accidental sampling method.
