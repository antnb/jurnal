In this study the objectives, namely 1) to analyze the effect of production, the US dollar exchange rate and credit interest rates Indonesian cocoa exports; 2) analyze the effect of production, the US dollar exchange rate and lending rates Indonesia's economic growth; 3) to analyze the effect of production, the US dollar exchange rate and credit interest rates on economic growth through Indonesian cocoa exports. This study uses secondary data located in Indonesia in the period 1988-2017 using path analysis techniques. The results showed that 1) the production and the exchange rate of the US dollar had a positive and significant effect while lending rates had a negative and significant effect on cocoa exports, 2) the production, the US dollar exchange rate, and cocoa exports had a positive and significant effect while the lending rates had a negative and significant effect on Indonesia's economic growth, 3) cocoa exports are intervening variables of the effect of production, the US dollar exchange rate and credit interest rates on Indonesia's economic growth.
