The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of capital, labor, and raw materials on production and to determine the level of efficiency and scale of production produced. The data used are primary data, namely by distributing questionnaires in each silver handicraft industry in Celuk Village, Gianyar Regency.

Using multiple linear regression analysis techniques in the form of double log. The results showed that capital, labor, and raw materials simultaneously had a significant influence on production. Capital, labor and raw materials have a partially significant effect on production, the level of efficiency of capital, labor, and efficient raw materials and the scale of production in the Scale of Return to Scale. The variable that has the most influence on production is capital. Keywords: Capital, Labor, Raw Materials, and Production"
