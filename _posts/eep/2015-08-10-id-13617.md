The data analysis technique used is double linear regression with Eviews application program.The analysis result shows that simultaneously for foreign exchange reserves, gross domestic product and the US dollar exchange rate had a significant impact on industrial raw material imports. Partial test results in gross domestic product is the significant positive effect but foreign exchange reserves no significant effect on the import of industrial raw materials due to foreign exchange reserves are used for foreign debt payments and the level of imports is strongly influenced by the economic conditions in Indonesia, while the US dollar exchange rate significant negative effect on industrial raw material imports. Gross domestic product is the dominant independent variable effect on industrial raw material imports in Indonesia from analysis of standardized coefficient beta."
