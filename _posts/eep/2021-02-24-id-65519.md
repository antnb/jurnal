The analysis technique used in this study is Multiple Linear Regression Analysis. The results of this study are; 1) simultaneous income per capita, dollar exchange rate and United States inflation significantly influence the export of animal and vegetable oils in Indonesia in the 1991-2017 period; 2) per capita income has a positive and significant effect on Indonesia's animal and vegetable oil exports for the 1991-2017 period; 3) the dollar exchange rate has a negative but not significant effect on Indonesian exports in the 1993-2017 period; 4) inflation has a positive and significant effect on Indonesia's animal and vegetable oil exports for the 1991-2017 period; and 5) the variable that has the most dominant influence on exports is inflation with the greatest coefficient value of 1047,394.
