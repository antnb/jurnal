A kitten was examined at the Udayana University Animal Hospital with complaints of recurrent prolapse, good appetite, and hyperactive. Physical and haematological examination showed that the kitten is proper to get surgery. Kitten being surgery with rectal resection method for rectum which got ulceration, then anastomosis is performed on remaining parts. Around the anus was sutured with a purse string technique.
