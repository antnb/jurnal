## Abstract:
"ABSTRACT Dyeing industries as part of textile processess produce wastewater which affect water bodies and harmfull for living organism in water caused by moderate organic compounds and high color. This study use free floating macrophytes constructed wetland methods with water hyacinth plant (Eichornia crassipes) to determine level of removal efficiency of BOD5, COD, TSS, and color intensity of wastewater from one of dyeing industry in Denpasar. Experiment was carried out in a laboratory scale to study the influence of plant on the treatment efficiency of waste water. This study was descriptive quantitative with BOD5, COD, TSS, and color intensity testing from dyeing wastewater. The result of the experiment shows the removal efficiency of BOD5 is 11,06% - 53,09%, COD is 8,31% - 55,22%, TSS is 6,84%, - 59,47%, and color intensity is 7,54% - 34,8% and the pH range is 7,33 – 8,90. Organic loading rate range is 424,57kg/ha.d - 2233,88 kg/ha.d. It summarized that constructed wetland using water hyacinth has low BOD5, COD, TSS, and color removal efficiency due to some effluent sample are higher than quality standard of Kep.Men.51/Men.LH/10/1995. Furthermore, the batch reactor test with no prior treatment result showed water hyacinth has low efficieny to remove color from dyeing waste water. Keywords: removal efficiency, dyeing wastewater, constructed wetland, water hyacinth"
