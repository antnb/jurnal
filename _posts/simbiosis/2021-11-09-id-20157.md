## Abstract:
"Necessity of soybean in Indonesia increase every year along with population growth. The goverment need to importthe soybeans from abroad. Soybean in Indonesia are generally planted in ricefield and upland (dryland) which have potentialof deficiency water. Water deficiency can caused the reduction of soybean production. Therefore some alternatives are neededto increase the yield of soybean productivity, one of them is applying arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The aim of thisresearch was to know the dosage of isolates AMF to increase the growth of soybean. The experiments conducted over 2months at Agriculture Faculty’s Greenhouse, Udayana University. The research use Completely Randomized Design whichconsists of 5 treatments, which are : without inoculation/negative control (M0), 50 spores AMF (M1), 100 spores AMF (M2),150 spores AMF (M3), and ZA/positive control (M4). The results showed that, the inoculation of spores AMF Bali indigenuswere significantly different (P&lt;0,05) on the number of leaves, leaf length, root fresh weight, and percentage of rootcolonization. The parameter of plant height, leaf width, plant fresh weight, and plant dry weight are no significant different(P&gt;0,05) based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) level 5%. Doses 50 spores AMF (M1) is the dose of inoculants has beenable to increase number of leaves, leaf length, root fresh weight, and percentage of root colonization.Keywords : fungi mycorrhizal arbuscular, mycorrhiza doses, soybean."
