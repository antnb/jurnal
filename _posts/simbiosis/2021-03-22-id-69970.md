## Abstract:
"Infection is a major problem mortality and morbidity in the world, a lot of an infection in the digestive tract is causes bacteria. The Escherichia coli O157 and Escherichia coli O157: H7 strains are bacteria that cause bloody diarrhea to death. Ultraviolet light has the potential to eliminate bacteria. The purpose is to know decontamination of E. coli O157 and E. coli O157: H7 on meat after ultraviolet exposure. The method is a factorial RBD with two factors (distance and time) with variations in distances (5, 10, 15, and 20 cm) and times (5, 10, 15, 20 dan 25 minutes). All treatments were repeated twice and obtained 160 samples. The quantitative data obtained were using univariant analysis followed by the Least Significant Difference with a significant level of 5%. The irradiation for E. coli O157 on meat with 5 cm for 25 minutes showed a significant reduction (88,62%), while the farthest distance 20 cm for 25 minutes decreased (73,42%). The nearest irradiation E. coli O157: H7 on meat 5 cm for 25 minutes show decrease (86,78%), while the farthest distance was 20 cm for 25 minutes (75,16%), there was an increase colonies in several treatment variations but overall decreased. In conclusion there was significant decrease number of bacterial colonies in meat given E. coli O157 culture, while there was a fluctuation decrease number of colonies in meats given E. coli O157: H7 culture."
