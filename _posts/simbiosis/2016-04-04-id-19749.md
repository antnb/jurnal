## Abstract:
"Bean sprouts, vegetables that are often consumed, contain vitamin E, C, riboflavin, niacin, folate, and some minerals suchas selenium, manganese, zinc and iron. Honey contains monosaccharide i.e. fructose, sucrose, glucose, and maltose. Thisstudy aimed to investigate the effect of bean sprout extract added with honey to the spermatozoa quality of male mice and themost concentration that affected. This research used a completely randomized design (CRD). Twenty male mice divided intofour groups: control (aquadest), P1 (25 mg/g BW bean sprout extract + 0.07 ml honey), P2 (50 mg/g BW bean sprout extract+ 0.07 ml honey) and P3 (75 mg/g BW bean sprout extract + 0.07 ml honey). The extracts were given 0.3 ml/mice/day for 30days. The variables that are observed were spermatozoa motility, morphology, viability and also amount of spermatozoa. Datawere analyzed with one way ANOVA and followed by Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT). The results showed that beansprout extracts added with honey gave positive effects by increasing type A motility of spermatozoa but decreased type Dmotility. The treatments also increased the amount of spermatozoa significantly. However, 75 mg/g BW bean sprout extract +0.07 ml honey did not affect spermatozoa morphology and viability of male mice (Mus musculus L.). The optimal dose thataffected sperm quality in this research was 50 mg/g BW bean sprout extract + 0.07 ml honey.Keywords : honey, Mus musculus L, bean sprout extracts, the quality of spermatozoa"
