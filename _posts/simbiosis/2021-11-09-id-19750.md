## Abstract:
"The aim of this study was to determine the of trigona species (stingless bee) live in different altitude in Bali. Samples were collected using purposive sampling technique, following earlier field observations to determine the location of the colonies. Samples were collected from three different locations, those were at Mawang and Taro Village at Gianyar Regency with the altitude of 750,87 m asl. Tua Village in Tabanan Regency with the altitude of 493,007 m asl, and Ngis Village in Karangase Regency with the altitude of 166,18 m asl, Species identifications were based on the morphological characters of nest entrance, the coloration of the body, wing venations, and the structure of bristle of hind tibia. Species identification were referred to Michener (2007), Schwarz (1939), Sakagami (1979), Sakagami and Inoue (1985), and Rassmusen and Cameron (2010). The result shows that out of 13 colonies collected from different altitude, ony 1 species was identified that was Trigona laeviceps. Keywords: Altitude, nest entrance, morphology, Trigona laeviceps"
