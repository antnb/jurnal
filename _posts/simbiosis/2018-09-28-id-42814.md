## Abstract:
"The purpose of this study was to determine variations in morphology and morphological characteristics of golden apple snails (P. canaliculata) in rice fields in Abiansemal Village. Gold apple snails can be found living in fresh water, including lakes, rivers, small ditches and also in rice fields. Rice field habitats in Bali can still be found in Abiansemal village, Badung regency, but not much information has been disclosed about the snails in the rice field habitat, especially the golden apple snail species (P. canaliculata). Therefore, it is necessary to do research on the golden apple snails in Abiansemal Village. This research was carried out in rice fields located in Abiansemal Village, Abiansemal District, Badung Regency, Bali Province. The study was conducted from April to May 2017. Sampling of golden apple snail (P. canaliculata) was carried out in three plots of rice fields in three banjars in Abiansemal Village, namely in the Latu Sari, Banjar Aseman, and Juwet banjars. The rice field was chosen randomly and then in each selected field of rice the golden apple snail sample was taken using a 1x1m square. Samples on each plot of rice were taken three times. All samples of golden snail contained in the squared were taken and cleaned and then preserved with 70% alcohol. The golden apple snail sample obtained was calculated for its density and all morphological and morphometric characters were analyzed descriptively. In this study it was found that the morphology of golden apple snail patterned lines for morphometric characters, the shell height was higher in the banjar Juwet area, for the width of the shell mouth was greater in the banjar area Aseman and the height of the shell cover was higher in the banjar area of Latu Sari, while the morphology was plain patterned for morphometric characters, the height of the shell and the height of tendrils were higher in the banjar area of Latu Sari, and for the height and width of the cover the shell was higher and wider in the banjar area of Aseman, while for the other morphometric characters the results were found almost the same. Keywords: snail, rice field, morphology, morphometry"
