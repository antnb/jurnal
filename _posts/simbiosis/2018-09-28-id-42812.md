## Abstract:
"The majority of body scrub that are distributed in the market contain paraben. Paraben is a type chemicals that are safe to use in the appropriate amount. But it could cause skin irritation. This research was conducted to know the durability from natural body scrub by yogurt and rice flour without chemical preservative and safe for skin. The research methods are comparison of the use of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus with concentration 25:25; 30:20; 20:30. The yogurt will be mixed with rice flour and the treatment control using factory yogurt with concentration of rice flour comparing with yogurt namely 10:14; 10:16; 10:18. This product was tested to 50 panelists. This product was kept in room temperature ±28oC for a month and conducted the identification of microbial impurities that contaminate the product with Gram staining method and catalase test. Data was analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Starter with different comparison 25:25, 30:20; 20:30 are not making real difference. All of the treatment produce yogurt with typical aroma of yogurt, white colored, and soft texture. The formula in K2 (10:16) treatment with the highest average that obtained 3.38 (very like) in color parameter and 3.08 (very like) in texture parameter. Although in aroma parameter the average value that obtained is 2.79 (like). In A1, A2, and B2 treatment had the highest durability percentage that obtained 83,3% and the lowest was shown in K1 and K3 treatment that obtained 0%. Microbial impurities that identified was bacteria from Genus Bacillus and Genus Streptobacillus, fungal impurities from Genus Aspergillus, Rhizopus, and Trichoderma. Keywords : lactic Acid bacteria, yogurt, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, body scrub"
