## Abstract:
"Seagrasses in Bali are distributed on coastal areas of south east Bali coastal waters of Nusa Dua, Serangan Island,Sanur Beach and beaches in Nusa Lembongan. In Bali, it has been reported that there are eight species of seagrasses. Thisresearch aimed to identify seagrass species on Lembongan Beach based on morphological characters and optimize PCRcondition for molecular analysis. This research is a preliminary research on molecular method for seagrass analysis. Seagrasssampling was conducted in Lembongan Beach (in front of Ketut’s Losmen) in Nusa Lembongan, Nusa Penida Subdistrict,Bali Province. DNA extraction method used was the method of Doyle and Doyle with modifications. Result showed thatthere are five species found in Lembongan Beach, Nusa Lembongan. These seagrass are Cymodocea rotundata, Enhalusacoroides, Halodule pinifolia, Thalassodendron ciliatum and Thalassia hemprichii. DNA extraction resulted in high size ofDNA and smear DNA. Optimation of PCR reaction of rbcL fragment was done at DNA concentration of 30 ng and 50 ng.The electrophoresisof PCR products showed that DNA concentration of 50 ng had thicker band than concentration of 30 ng.Keywords: DNA extraction, Morphology, PCR rbcL, Seagrass"
