## Abstract:
"Black orchid (Coelogyne pandurata Lindl.) is an orchid endemic to the island ofBorneo. However, its existence is increasingly threatened with extinction. Conventionalpropagation efforts require a long time. Therefore in vitro propagation was performed. Thepurpose of this study was to determine the growth response of black orchids on the media anddifferent planting techniques. Black orchid plantlets that have been sub-cultured wasacclimatized in four different media types ie moss, fern, wood charcoal, wood charcoal andcoconut fiber mixture and different planting techniques namely compot (community pot) andthe individual, were allowed to grow for three months. Randomized block design (RBD) wasutilised, obtained 8 combination treatments, with 7 replicates. The results showed blackorchid has a good growth response in the media moss, ferns, and a mixture of wood charcoaland coconut fiber, while the wood charcoal media showed unfavorable results. Differentplanting techniques showed no significant results. Percentage of high life shown in mixedmedia wood charcoal and coconut fiber and compot techniques.Keyword : Black orchid (Coelogyne pandurata Lindl.), acclimatization, media"
