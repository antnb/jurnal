## Abstract:
"Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) has been used as traditional medicine, such asdrugs to decrease the level of blood glucose, so it can be used as drug to indicatediabetes. The aim of this research is to study the histopathological change of mice’s livergiven leucaena leaf extract. This research used 24 male mice that were divided into 4 groupsby completely randomized design. Group P0 (control) were given 0,9 % NaCl, and groupsP1, P2, and P3 were given 0,5 g / kg bw, 1 g / kg bw, and 1,5 g / kg bw leucaena’s leafextract by oral administration respectively. The treatment were given daily for 30 days. All ofthe mice were necropsied at day 31, and the liver were taken to examine theirhistopathological change. Histopathological change examination were based on the presenthydropic degeneration, fatty degeneration, and apoptosis surround central vein. Result ofstatistically analised by ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis method indicated no significancedifference among the control and treatments. There was no significance toxicity effect ofleucaena leaf extract of all treatment dosage on mice liver.Keywords: Leucaena leucocephala, liver histology, Mus musculus L."
