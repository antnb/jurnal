## Abstract:
"There are many variation of Plumeria sp. that grown in Bali. The genetic identity of Plumeria sp. need to be analysedusing molecular study for plant breeding purpose. DNA extraction and primer selection are basic steps for molecular studyespecially in identification and analysis of genetic diversity. The aim of this research was to determine RAPD primerssuitable for molecular analysis of Plumeria sp. This research used CTAB method with modification for DNA extraction. Thesamples were young leaves of Plumeria sp. dried using silica gel. The primers used were produced by University of BritishColumbia and Operon Primer Technology. The results showed that DNA concentration of Plumeria sp from dried leaves wasbetween 33-267 ng/?l. Out of seven primers tested, three primers UBC-127, UBC-250, and OPH-06 produced clear andscorable amplification products for further analyses.Keywords: DNA, Plumeria sp., RAPD primer"
