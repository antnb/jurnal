## Abstract:
"Breadfruit (Artocarpus communis Forst.) leaves have a high antioxidant content. This research aims to know the effect of breadfruit leaf extracts on blood sugar levels and the amount of sperm in rat. This study used a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) using 30 rats aged 2-3 months and weighing 150-200 grams. Male rats were divided into six groups, i.e. negative control group (K1) without treatment, groups K2, P1, P2, P3 and P4 are given then NaCl 0.9%, breadfruit leaf extracts 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg body weight, and glibenclamide 1 mg/kg body weight respectively. The treatments were given every day for 21 days. Blood sugar levels were measured before and after aloksan administration, day 7, 14, and 21 after treatment as well as counting the number of sperm after 21 days. The data obtained were analyzed with ANOVA and Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT), using the program of SPSS For Windows version 22. Results of the study showed that breadfruit (Artocarpus communis Forst.) leaf extracts could lowered blood glucose levels and the most effective concentration was 100 mg/kg body weight of breadfruit leaf extracts given for 21 days with the effectiveness of 66,77%. Breadfruit leaf extracts did not inhibit spermatogenesis. So the amount of rat sperm did not different significantly among treatment. Keywords: blood sugar levels, breadfruit, rat, sperm count"
