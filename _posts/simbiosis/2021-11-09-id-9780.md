## Abstract:
"This research was conducted to find out the best media and auxin for plantingpotato cutting to produce G1 seed potato. Research was done at a shade house ofKebun Bibit Hortikultura Kembang Merta, Candi Kuning Village, Baturiti, TabananRegency, Bali. Were planted at the screen house for sprouting. Four weeks old ofshoots were used as cutting. Each cutting measured 10 cm. Stem cutting of G0 seedpotatoes was dipped in 2 different auxin types (Rootone F and auxin paste) and plantedin 2 different media (manure and charred rice husk). Results shows that the bestcombination between media and auxin for stem cutting growth was charred rice huskand Rootone F, in which 82.29% growth was recorded. Combination between charredrice husk and Rootone F produced 12 more seed potatoes per plant, compared to othertreatment combination. In term of seed potato size, the highest number produced (80%)was size SS (&lt;20 gram) , followed by size S (21-30 gram) which is 66%, size M (31-60gram) which is 8% and size L (&gt;60%) of 2%.Keyword : Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), stem cuttings, seed production."
