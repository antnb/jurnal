## Abstract:
"The research aims to determine the anatomical structure of the leaf stalk fiber Coconut(Cocos nucifera L. "Rangda") on the seedling and parent plant. Sampling was conducted atSanghyang village Melaya district, Regency of Jembrana. Preparations and microscopicobservations made in the laboratory of Plant Development Structure Biology Department,FMIPA Unud. The research was conducted in October 2012 - April 2013. Maceration methodused for preparations sklerenkim fibers and xylem elements. The results showed that theanatomical parent plant and seedling petiole were torque and mostly composed bysclerenchym fibers but in the parent plant more torque than seedling. In the parent plant about81% the sclerenchym cell was torque but in seedling only 13%, with an average number of17 ± 1 torsion of the parent plant and 6 ± 1 in seedling.Keywords: the fiber structure, torque"
