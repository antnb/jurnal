## Abstract:
"The research aimed to analyze genetic variation of Rangda coconut in Bali based on microsatellite DNA markers. The young leaf (busung) were collected from Gunaksa village at Klungkung regency, Tulikup village at Gianyar regency, Kubu village at Bangli regency, Sanghyang village, Jembrana regency one sample each, and three samples are from Ngis village at Karangasem regency. Doyle and Doyle DNA extraction method was used to extract DNA from the samples. Three primer pairs of CnCirC3, CNZ05 and CNZ51 were used to amplify DNA samples. Amplicons were electrophoresed on PAGE 10% and stained with silver nitrate. The allele size was determined by plotting the amplicon migration distance on semilog paper. The results showed there were 11 alleles with an average of 13.33 alleles per primer. There were 3 alleles on primer CNZ05, 4 alleles on primer CnCirC3 and CNZ51 each. Heterozigosity expectation (He) value on primer CnCirC3, CNZ05, and CNZ51 were 0,49±0,04, 0,27±0,03 and 0,71±0,06 consecutively. The result showed that Genetic relationship among 7 coconut samples were divided into two big groups. Key word : Rangda coconut, Microsatellite marker, Number allele, Genetic relationship"
