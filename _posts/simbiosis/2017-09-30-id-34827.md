## Abstract:
"plastics on a large scale has an effect on the increase to the amount of world waste, such as High Density Polyethylene (HDPE)and Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) plastics. This study, tried to isolate Pseudomonas and Ochrobactrum bacteria from varioussoil in dumped soil area and mangrove forest in Bali to find out the degradation ability of the bacteria against HDPE and LDPEplastics. The methods used in this study were pour plate method, Biochemical and morphology identification by using Bergey’sManual of Determinative Bacteriology 9th Edition book as a reference, screening test and the determination of bacterial species byusing Vitek 2 Compact System. Evaluation of degradation result was done by measuring the weight loss of plastics residues. Thisstudy has isolated 27 bacteria that estimated from genus Pseudomonas and Ochrobactrum with characteristics as basil shape, Gramnegative, positive catalase and classified as non-fermenter bacteria. Isolate 2 bacteria which isolated from Suwung dumped soil hasidentified as Ochrobactrum anthropi with the ability of HDPE degradation by 20% and Isolate 24 which isolated from Karangasemdumped soil has identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the ability of HDPE degradation by 18,75%.Keywords : Plastics waste, Biodegradation, High Density Polyethylene and Low Density Polyetene"
