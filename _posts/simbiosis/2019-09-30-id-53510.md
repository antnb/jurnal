## Abstract:
"Sumenep is one of the regencies on Madura Island which is famous for traditional herbal medicine. The traditional herbal medicine ingredients of the Sumenep community come from wild plants and cultivation plants. The research aims to identify wild plant species as an effort to inventory wild plants that are used as traditional herbal ingredients. The research is an exploratory study conducted by in-depth interviews with sources who understand traditional herbal medicine such as traditional birth attendants, masseurs and herbalists. The study was conducted in District of Dungkek, Batang-Batang and Gapura. The results found 22 families of wild plants consisting of 29 types of plants with diverse benefits as ingredients of traditional herbal medicine."
