## Abstract:
"ABSTRACT The use of traditional medicines in human therapies has been claimed to be much safer than that of synthetic medicines with many negative side effects. Pletekan plant (Ruellia tuberosa L.) has been used empirically for years as an antidiabetic as its leaves contain poly phenolic compounds with the ability to stimulate beta cells of the pancreas so that its capability to produce insulin improved. The main objective of our research was to identify active compounds contained in Ruellia tuberosa L. leaves extracted with ethanol. Fractionation of these active compounds was conducted by applying column and thin layer chromatography using Dichlorometan and Ethylacetat with a ratio of 6:3 as eluent. Each active compound resulted from fractionation was identified using GC-MS analysis. The results showed that four active compounds (Hexadecanamide, 9-Octadecenamide, (Z), Octadecenamide and 1,2-Benzenedicarboxylic acid were identified in this analysis. Keywords: Ruellia tuberosa L., identification of active compounds."
