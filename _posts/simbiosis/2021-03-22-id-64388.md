## Abstract:
"Utilization of springs as water resources for their daily needs by the people of Sukawati Sub-Distric of Gianyar Regency, Bali is still quite high Human activities, such as increasing domestic, industrial and agricultural activities, have an effect on decreasing water quality. This research was conducted ini December 2019 to January 2020 at Pancoran Kutri springs, Beji Dalem Agung Kemenuh springs and Taman Beji Cengcengan springs. This research aimed to determine water quality based on Bali Governor's Regulation No.16 of 2016 concerning Environmental Quality Standards and Standard Criteria for Enviromental Damage Based on Class (Class I) and Minister of Health Republic of Indonesia Regulation No.492/ Menkes/Per/IV/2010 concerning Prerequisites for Drinking Water Quality. The parameters analyzed were the physical parameters (temperature and TDS), the chemical parameters (pH, DO, BOD, nitrate, phosphate, cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb)) and the biological parameters (fecal coliform bacteria). The results of the research conducted showed that the water quality in the three springs in the study location still met the water quality standards. However, DO parameters at Pancoran Kutri springs, BOD parameters at Taman Beji Cengcengan springs and phosphate in the three springs at the research location are based on regulations, as well as fecal coliform bacteria parameters in the three springs at the research location based on the Regulation of the Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia No. 492/Menkes/Per/IV/2010 have exceeded the quality standard threshold."
