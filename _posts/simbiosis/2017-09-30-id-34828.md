## Abstract:
"longer than other bananas and the availability is limited. One way to accelerate the availability of banana is by treating it naturaly andchemical. How to do in determining the ripeness of bananas as morphological and chemical analysis.The objectives of this study wereto explore the utilization of Gliricidia sepium leaf, cocoa leaf, banana leaf and ethylene and the duration of treatment to the maturitylevel of Musa paradisiaca forma typica, vitamin C, vitamin A, reducing sugar content as well as ripening time and rotting. CompletelyRandomized Design was used with 2 factors, the duration of curing with 3 treatments ie L1 (curing for 3 days), L2 (curing for 6 days)and L3 (curing for 9 days) and type of calibration method used was C0 (control), C1 (curing with ethylene 0,5%), C2 (curing withbanana leaf), C3 (curing with Gliricidia sepium leaf) and C4 (curing with cocoa leaf) . Each treatment combination was repeated 4times with 3 experimental units. The results showed that curing with cocoa leaves and 0.5% ethylene affected banana maturity.Ethylene (0.5%) increase the maturation score and vitamin C. Cocoa increased maturation score, reducing sugar and vitamin Ccontent. The longer the curing the more increase the maturation score and increase the reducing sugar content.Keywords: Musa paradisiaca forma typica, ethylene, cocoa leaf, banana leaf, G. sepium leaf"
