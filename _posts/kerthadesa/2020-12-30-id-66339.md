## Abstract:
"Aborsi merupakam pengguguran kandungan yang dilakukan dengan sengaja oleh perbuatan manusia karena kehamilan yang tidak diinginkan salah satunya kehamilan akibat perkosaan.Tindakan aborsi dilarang didalam Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Pidana (KUHP ) sedangkan di dalam Undang- Undang Nomor 36 Tahun 2009 Tentang Kesehatan dan Peraturan Pelaksanaannya mengecualikan tindakan aborsi akibat perkosaan. Dalam hal ini tindakan aborsi dilakukan akibat perkosaan incest dan akan ditinjau berdasarkan hukum pidana adat. Sehingga dalam hal ini terdapat suatu masalah bagaimanakah legalisasi hukum terhadap tindakan abortus akibat perkosaan berdasarkan peraturan di Indonesia dan bagaimanakah tinjauan hukum terhadap perkosaan incest berdasarkan hukum pidana adat. Penulisan ini memiliki tujuan untuk mengetahui dan memahami bagaimanakah legalisasi hukum terhadap tindakan abortus akibat perkosaan dalam hal ini perkosaan incest jika ditinjau dari peraturan di Indonesia dan pidana adat. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah metode penelitian normatif dimana terdapat suatu konflik norma antara KUHP yang didukung oleh hukum pidana adat yang melarang tindakan aborsi akibat perkosaan khususnya incest dengan Undang-Undang Nomor 36 Tahun 2009 Tentang Kesehatan dan Peraturan Pelaksanaannya yang mengecualikan tindakan aborsi akibat perkosaan. Sehingga kesimpulan dari penulisan ini adalah legalisasi tindakan aborsi di dalam KUHP dilarang karena dianggap menghilngkan nyawa sedangkan di dalam Undang-Undang Kesehatan dan Peraturan Pelaksanannya juga melarang tindakan aborsi namun mengecualikan berdasarkan kedaruratan medis dan kehamilan akibat perkosaan. Jika ditinjau berdasarkan hukum pidana adat, tindakan aborsi dilarang serta dikenakan sanksi adat sesuai peraturan atau awig-awig di suatu desa.
