ABSTRACT As a living being that develops and lives, the most important real form is a guarantee and protection for everyone who has the same principles and is in line with those seen in the eyes of the law and there is no exception whatsoever. The right to justice is an element of human rights. Beliefs are treated equally wherever they are and the right to be defended by lawyers or legal advisors are human rights that need to be guaranteed to achieve social justice. This paper can be seen and studied in the perspective of a paper with a normative research method with a norm approach to the provisions of the law and books as the basis of reasoning. As well as will be studied with the approach of legal theories in finding a gap in legal norms in library studies, it is necessary to have an awareness in establishing harmony in the social environment by prioritizing a human right in obtaining legal assistance to address legal problems being faced by obtaining justice and also the benefits in the scope of addressing the problem of providing legal aid to small communities in order to get equality in obtaining justice, a certain condition in obtaining legal aid is the basic foundation that the belief in obtaining the belief to obtain justice above all becomes a right and belief that cannot be ruled out by the requirements as a poor citizen must also be completed with documentary evidence made in the surrounding village as a guarantee of equality for the whole community because the law of living in the community and society exists because a law. Key Words: Social Justice, Legal Assistance, Underprivileged people."
