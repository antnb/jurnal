Lalu bagi pasangan suami istri untuk dapat ikut berkecimpung dalam praktik sewa rahim ini haruslah telah menikah minimal 5 tahun dan telah divonis oleh dokter mengalami kesulitan mendapatkan anak secara alami. Kemudian di negara Rusia praktik surrogate mother dilegalkan, sehingga banyak pasangan suami istri yang turut menggunakan atau terlibat dalam praktik tersebut agar memiliki anak dengan syarat sebagai wanita pengganti harus berumur 20-35 tahun, Ibu pengganti potensial harus memiliki anak sendiri yang sehat secara mental dan fisik, dan dapat diakses oleh warga negara asing.

The process of implementing and arranging uterine leases in international countries is carried out by several countries which in this study are India and Russia. In India, the practice of renting a uterus was legalized by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) with restrictions on becoming a surrogate mother, namely one time only and renting only for close relatives. Then for a husband and wife to be involved in the practice of renting a uterus, they must have been married for at least 5 years and have been convicted by a doctor of having difficulty having children naturally.

As a form of absolute right, the human right to continue offspring is regulated by several international instruments including the UDHR and CEDAW.
