## Abstract:
"Tujuan dari penulisan studi ini adalah bertujuan untuk mengkaji bagaimana pemenuhan hak atas kesehatan melalui vaksinasi Covid-19 bagi penyandang disabilitas. Metode yang dipergunakan pada tulisan penelitian ini adalah metode penelitian hukum normatif melalui peraturan perundang-undangan, jurnal, buku, internet. Hasil dari studi ini menunjukan penyandang disabilitas merupakan salah satu kelompok prioritas penerima vaksinasi Covid-19 yang termasuk ke dalam bagian masyarakat rentan. Hal tersebut merupakan wujud bahwa prinsip non diskriminasi telah dilaksnakan oleh pemerintah dengan dibentuknya Peraturan Menteri Kesehatan Republik Indonesia No. 10 Tahun 2021 Tentang Pelaksanaan Vaksinasi Dalam Rangka Penanggulangan Pandemi Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Implementasinya, pemerintah daerah Bali dan Jawa Barat dalam melaksanakan vaksinasi Covid-19 bagi penyandang disabilitas dilakukan dengan cara sistem door to door atau jemput bola sebagai bentuk perwujudan pemenuhan hak atas kesehatan. Dengan demikian, penyandang disabilitas sebagai warga negara berhak mendapatkan pelayanan kesehatan, yakni pelayanan Vaksinasi COVID-19. Kata Kunci: Hak Atas Kesehatan, Vaksinasi Covid-19, Penyandang Disabilitas. The purpose of writing this study is to examine how to fulfill the right to health through Covid-19 vaccination for persons with disabilities. The method used in this research paper is a normative legal research method by examining through laws and regulations, journals, books, internet. The results of this study show that people with disabilities are one of the priority groups for Covid-19 vaccination recipients who are included in the vulnerable community. This is a manifestation that the principle of non-discrimination has been implemented by the government with the establishment of Regulation of the Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia No. 10 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of Vaccination in the Context of Combating the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. In its implementation, the local governments of Bali and West Java in carrying out Covid-19 vaccinations for persons with disabilities are carried out by means of a door to door system or ball pick-up as a form of embodiment of the fulfillment of the right to health. Thus, persons with disabilities as citizens have the right to receive health services, namely COVID-19 vaccination services. Key Words: Right to Health, Covid-19 Vaccination, Persons with Disabilities."
