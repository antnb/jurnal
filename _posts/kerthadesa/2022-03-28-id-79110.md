Penelitian ini termasuk sebagai jenis metode penelitian hukum normatif dan menggunakan pendekatan perundang-undangan (statue approach) dan pendekatan konsep (conceptual approach). Hasil studi menunjukkan bahwa persyaratan menjadi anggota Direksi Perseroan Terbatas tercantum di ketentuan Pasal 93 ayat (1) UU Perseroan Terbatas. Kemudian terdapat implikasi antara Undang-Undang Perseroan Terbatas dengan Undang-Undang Kepailitan dan Penundaan Kewajiban Pembayaran Utang, yaitu mengenai akibat keputusan kepailitan di Pasal 21 UU Kepailitan dan PKPU hanya melingkupi seluruh aset atau harta benda yang dipunyai Debitor saat putusan pailit dikeluarkan dan juga berupa segala sesuatu yang didapat selama kepailitan.
