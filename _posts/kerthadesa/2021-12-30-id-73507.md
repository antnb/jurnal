## Abstract:
"Tujuan penulisan artikel ini untuk mengkaji actio pauliana dalam rangka upaya perlindungan kepada kreditor dalam kepailitan serta pengaturan actio pauliana dalam undang-undang kepailitan. Artikel ini menggunakan metode penelitian hukum normatif dengan pendekatan perundang-undangan yang berkaitan dengan actio pauliana. Hasil penulisan menunjukkan bahwa Undang-Undang Kepailitan dan Penundaan Kewajiban Pembayaran Utang memberikan upaya kepada kreditor agar kreditor menuntut haknya dari debitor melalui actio pauliana yang dilakukan oleh kurator. Melindungi dan mengelola harta kekayaan pailit untuk kepentingan semua pihak yang berkepentingan dengan harta pailit sebagaimana tugas dari kurator. Perbuatan hukum yang digugat actio pauliana dalam kasus pailit tidak menguntungkan kreditor, yaitu pelunasan atau pemberian jaminan utang yang belum jatuh tempo, belum dipulihkan, atau tidak dapat ditagih. Upaya perlindungan terhadap kreditor atas asset yang pailit yaitu dilakukannya sita umum terhadap semua kekayaan debitor yang ada pada saat putusan pernyataan pailit diumumkan maupun harta yang diterima selama kepailitan dan hilangnya hak dalam menguasai serta menangani kekayaannya semenjak putusan pernyataan pailit diumumkan. Penyitaan terhadap aset debitor digunakan untuk membayar utang kepada kreditor. Kata Kunci: Upaya Perlindungan, Kreditor, Actio Pauliana, Kepailitan ABSTRACT The purpose of this article is to examine Actio Pauliana in order to protect creditors in bankruptcy and to regulate Actio Pauliana in the bankruptcy law. This article uses normative legal research method, which emphasizes the principles of law and legislation relating to Actio Pauliana. The results of the writing show that the Law on Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations provides efforts to creditors so that creditors demand their rights from debtors through actio pauliana carried out by the curator. Protect and manage bankruptcy assets for the benefit of all parties with an interest in the bankruptcy assets as the logical duties of the curator. The legal action that was sued by Actio Pauliana in the bankruptcy case didn’t benefit the creditor, namely repayment or guaranteeing of debts that are not yet due, not yet recovered, or not billable. Efforts to protect creditors for bankrupt assets include general confiscation of all assets of the debtors at the time the decision to declare bankruptcy was announced as well as assets received during the bankruptcy and loss of rights to control and manage their assets since the decision to declare bankruptcy was announced. The confiscation of the debtor's assets is used to pay debts to creditors. Key Words: Protection measures, Creditors, Actio Pauliana, Bankruptcy"
