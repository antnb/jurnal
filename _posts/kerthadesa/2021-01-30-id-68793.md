ABSTRACT The purpose of writing this article is to find out and analyze the effectiveness of the implementation of post-conflict local elections during the Covid-19 pandemic in Bali Province as well as knowing and analyzing the inhibiting factors and efforts of the general election commission (KPU) to overcome the obstacles as intended. Empirical legal research methods. Sources of data obtained are field data obtained through direct observation methods and through interviews. The results showed that the implementation of the Regional Head Election by the General Election Commission during the Covid-19 pandemic had not been effective, based on reasons of substance, structure and culture. As an effort to overcome these obstacles, the KPU urges all Balinese people, both on social media and in print, not to be afraid to come to the TPS in six regencies / cities of Bali because all organizers up to the KPPS level have taken the Covid-19 rapid test and used personal protective equipment and logistical health protocol, dividing the room for voters who have a body temperature above 37.3 degrees, as well as ensuring that there will be no crowds and have synergized with the civil service police units, TNI, Polri and the Covid-19 task force.
