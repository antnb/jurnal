"The realization of tax receipts in 2013-2015 with the target set not in accordance with the expected. This is due to the taxpayer's actions to minimize the tax burden or tax avoidance measures. Tax avoidance is an attempt made by the taxpayer (the company) to reduce or minimize the corporate tax burden. Tax avoidance is pro-duced with Effective Tax Rates (ETR).
