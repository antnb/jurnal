The results of this study indicate that the competence of human resources has a positive effect on prevention of fraud in village financial management. Morality has a positive effect on prevention of fraud in managing village finances. The internal control system has a positive effect on preventing fraud in managing village finances. This means, with the competency of human resources, good morality and a strong internal control system, it can prevent fraud in managing village finances.
