Data collection is done by non-participant observation method. Based on the results of the analysis it was found that room income and sales commission costs simultaneously had a significant effect on AAR. Room income partially has a significant effect on AAR. This shows that satisfying a room will provide a good average room rate. Sales commissions partially have a significant effect on AAR This shows that the sales commission from the room revenue generated given to travel agents will be better productivity for the average hotel rate hotel that is given.
