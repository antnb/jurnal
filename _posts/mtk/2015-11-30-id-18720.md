## Abstract:
"Semiparametric regression model estimation is an estimation that combines both parametric and nonparametric regression model. In semiparametric regression, some of the variables are parametrics and the others are nonparametrics. Semiparametric regression is used when relationship pattern between independent and depentdent variables is half known and half unknown. Regression curve smoothing technique in nonparametric components in this study was using uniform kernel function. The optimal semiparametric regression curve estimation was obtained by optimal bandwidth. By choosing optimal bandwidth, we would obtain a smooth regression curve estimation in respect to data pattern. In choosing optimal bandwidth, we use minimum GCV as a criteria.The purpose of this study was to estimate the semiparametric regression function of dengue fever case using uniform kernel estimator. There were 6 independent variables namely age (in years) body temperature (in Celcius), heartbeat (in times/minutes) hematocryte ratio (in percent), amount of trombocyte (× 103/ul) and fever duration ( in days). Age, body temperature, heartbeat, amount of trombosyte and fever duration are parametric components and hematocryte ration is a nonparametric component. The optimal bandwidth (h) which was obtained with minimum GCVwas 0,005. The value of MSE which was obtained by using multiple linear regression analysis was 0,031 and by using semiparametric regression was 0,00437119."
