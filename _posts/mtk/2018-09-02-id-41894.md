## Abstract:
"Tuberculosis is a contagious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Based on data from the health office of Bali Province, in 2015 tuberculosis cases found 0,96%, while in 2016 tuberculosis cases increase to 1,05%. This research used truncated spline nonparametric regression to model tuberculosis cases in Bali Province in 2016. This method was used because truncated spline has high flexibility compared to other polynomial models. The truncated spline function has a connecting point called knots. The best estimation of truncated spline regression model is obtained from optimal knot point selection by calculating minimum generalized cross validation. The estimated truncated model is linear with one knot point with determination coefficient equals to 70,48 %. In addition, it is also found in order to reduce tuberculosis cases the government of Bali Province should increase percentage of family who lives clean and healthy."
