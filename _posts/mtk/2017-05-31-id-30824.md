## Abstract:
"A tuberculosis model of SEIT type which incorporates treatment of infectives is considered. The population is divided into four compartments, that is: S are individuals in the susceptible compartment, E are individuals in the exposed compartments, I are individuals in the infected compartment, and T are individuals in the treatment compartments. For this model, controls on treatment is incorporated to reduce the actively infected individual compartments, via application of the Pontryagins Maximum Principle of optimal control theory. Numerical calculations with the approach of the Runge-Kutta method of fourth order can be seen that, the influence of the control treatment to more effectively reduce the number of individuals in the infected compartment compared with no controls. The basic reproduction ratio with control less compared with no controls."
