## Abstract:
"Weather information has an important role in human life in various fields, such as agriculture, marine, and aviation. The accurate weather forecasts are needed in order to improve the performance of various fields. In this study, use artificial neural network method with backpropagation learning algorithm to create a model of weather forecasting in the area of ??South Bali. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of the number of neurons in the hidden layer and to determine the level of accuracy of the method of artificial neural network with backpropagation learning algorithm in weather forecast models. Weather forecast models in this study use input of the factors that influence the weather, namely air temperature, dew point, wind speed, visibility, and barometric pressure.The results of testing the network with a different number of neurons in the hidden layer of artificial neural network method with backpropagation learning algorithms show that the increase in the number of neurons in the hidden layer is not directly proportional to the value of the accuracy of the weather forecasts, the increase in the number of neurons in the hidden layer does not necessarily increase or decrease value accuracy of weather forecasts we obtain the best accuracy rate of 51.6129% on a network model with three neurons in the hidden layer."
