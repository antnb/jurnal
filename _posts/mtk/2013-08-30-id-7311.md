## Abstract:
"Chernoff Faces method is a graphical method of visualization techniques to present data with many variables in the form of a cartoon face which can be determined by 20 parameters or less. In this research it was shown how the Chernoff Faces method was used to see welfare of the people in the province of Bali and Bali's nine regencies. To pair the variables and Chernoff’s facial features, then we used Principal Component Analysis and survey to make the faces look more human. The result from 18 indicators of welfare of the people in the province of Bali, only 8 indicators were not really well. It was obtained too that Tabanan was the most prosperous regency and Karangasem was the lest prosperous regency."
