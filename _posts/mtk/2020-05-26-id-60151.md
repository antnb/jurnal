## Abstract:
"Ordinary differential equation is one form of differential equations that are often found in everyday life. One form of ordinary differential equations which has non–constant coefficients is the Cauchy–Euler differential equation. In the nonhomogeneous Cauchy–Euler differential equations, the undetermined coefficient and the parameter variation were the most method that often used to find the particular solution. This paper aimed to show a new solution that was shorter than the previous methods for nonhomogeneous Cauchy–Euler differential equations with the right side was a logarithmic form. The new solution had been proven to produce the same solution as the ordinary solution sought using the undetermined coefficient method."
