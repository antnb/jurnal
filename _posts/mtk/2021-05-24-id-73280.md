## Abstract:
"Nutritional problems in toddler are still a serious problem in various districts/cities in Indonesia. The case of malnutrition in Bali Province vary in many regions and hypothesized to be influenced by geographic location, which is often known as spatial heterogeneity. To overcome this problem, a spatial regression method is used on this research. This study aims to model the factors that are hypothesized affect malnourished toddlers in Bali Province using spatial regression methods, i.e. spatial autoregressive model (SAR) and spatial error model (SEM). Both models have 5 predictors variable, i.e. the percentage of toddlers aged between 6 - 59 months who received vitamin A, the percentage of babies with low birth weight (LBW), the percentage of households with clean and healthy living behavior (PHBS), the percentage of children under five receiving exclusive breastfeeding, and the percentage of toddler health services, which are obtained from Bali Provincial Health Office. The results showed SEM method produced smaller AIC value and higher , with and AIC values ??of 96.24% and 60.84, respectively."
