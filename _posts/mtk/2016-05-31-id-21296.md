## Abstract:
"Cluster analysis is one of data analysis used to classify objects in clusters which has objects with the same characteristics, whereas the other cluster has different characteristics. One part of the method of analysis cluster is hierarchy method. In a hierarchical method there are methods of linkage in the form of incorporation. Generally, methods of linkage is divided into 5 methods: single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage, Ward and centroid. The purpose of this study was to determine the best method of linkage among the method of single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage, and Ward, using Euclidean and Pearson proximity distance. Base on the smallest value of CTM (Cluster Tightness Measure), the best method of linkage as a result of this research was average linkage in Pearson distance."
