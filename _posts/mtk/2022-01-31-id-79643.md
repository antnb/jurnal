FARAJ YACOOB ISHAK

## Abstract:
"In this paper we study the existence and uniqueness solution for a first kind fractional Volterra boundary value problem involving Hadamard type and three-point boundary conditions. Our analysis is based on Krasnoselskii-Zabreiko’s fixed point theorem and Banach contraction principle. As an application we discuss a Hadamard type boundary value problem with fractional integral boundary conditions. We emphasize that our results are new in the context of Hadamard fractional calculus and are well illustrated with the aid of examples."
