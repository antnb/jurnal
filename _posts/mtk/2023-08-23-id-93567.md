## Abstract:
"Ladder Graph is one type of connected and simple graph that has its own uniqueness. The aim of this research is to find the k-deficiency of points in the spanning tree in the ladder graph. Calculation of k-deficiency is carried out for each additional step, starting from the second ladder ( L2), up to the nth Ladder (Ln). Calculations are based on a representative spanning tree on each ladder. In the end, we get a number pattern from the second ladder onwards which is then proven by mathematical induction, for the calculation of each step up the ladder. In this study, the pattern of k-deficiency points on the ladder graph was obtained."
