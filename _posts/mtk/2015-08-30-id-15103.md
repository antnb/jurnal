## Abstract:
"Regression analysis is a method of data analysis to describe the relationship between response variables and predictor variables. There are two approaches to estimating the regression function. They are parametric and nonparametric approaches. The parametric approach is used when the relationship between the predictor variables and the response variables are known or the shape of the regression curve is known. Meanwhile, the nonparametric approach is used when the form of the relationship between the response and predictor variables is unknown or no information about the form of the regression function. The aim of this study are to determine the best spline nonparametric regression model on data of quality of the product, price, and advertising on purchasing decisions of Yamaha motorcycle with optimal knots point and to compare it with the multiple regression linear based on the coefficient of determination (R2) and mean square error (MSE). Optimal knot points are defined by two point knots. The result of this analysis is that for this data multiple regression linear is better than the spline regression one."
