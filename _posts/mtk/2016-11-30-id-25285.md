## Abstract:
"Poisson regression is a nonlinear regression which is often used for count data and has equidispersion assumption (variance value equal to mean value). However in practice, equidispersion assumption is often violated. One of it violations is overdispersion (variance value greater than the mean value). One of the causes of overdipersion is excessive number of zero values on the response variable (excess zeros). There are many methods to handle overdispersion because of excess zeros. Two of them are Zero Inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression and Zero Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) regression. The purpose of this research is to determine which regression models is better in handling overdispersion data. The data that can be analyzed using the ZIP and ZINB regression is maternal mortality rate in the Province of Bali. Maternal mortality rate data has proportion of zeros value more than 50% on the response variable. In this research, ZINB regression better than ZIP regression for modeling maternal mortality rate. The independent variable that affects the number of maternal mortality rate in the Province of Bali is the percentage of mothers who carry a pregnancy visit, with ZINB regression models and ."
