## Abstract:
"Graph labelling is a function that maps graph elements to positive integers. A covering of graph is family subgraph from , for with integer k. Graph admits covering if for every subgraph is isomorphic to a graph . A connected graph is an - antimagic if there are positive integers and bijective function such that there are injective function , defined by with . The purpose of this research is to determine a total super antimagic covering on lobster graph . The method of this research is literature study method. It is obtained that there are a total super antimagic covering for on lobster graph with integer and even number ."
