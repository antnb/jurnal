## Abstract:
"An option contract is a contract that gives the owner the right to sell or even to buy an asset at the predetermined price and period time. The conditional Monte Carlo is one of the several methods that is used to determine the option price which in the process uses random numbers with normal standard distribution. At the same time, the random number generator can be substituted by using a quasi-random sequence, as in Faure's quasi-random sequence. The aim of this study is to determine the contract price of the call option with the European type by applying the conditional Monte Carlo method. This method used the Faure quasi-random sequence and compared it with the method of Monte Carlo standard, Monte Carlo standard in using the quasi-random sequence of Faure, and conditional Monte Carlo. The results of this study showed that the call option calculated using the conditional Monte Carlo method using the quasi-random Faure sequence began to stabilize at the 5000th simulation for K = 32575 and K = 34725 and in the 10000th simulation for K = 33000 and K = 33950. Research also show that with the conditional Monte Carlo in using the quasi-random sequence of Faure is more stable. Therefore, it is obtained its real value faster than the Monte Carlo standard, Monte Carlo standard in using the quasi-random sequence of Faure, and conditional Monte Carlo. The MAPE value of conditional Monte Carlo in using the quasi-random sequences of Faure and the Monte Carlo standard is smaller than the Monte Carlo standard in using the quasi-random sequence of Faure, and conditional Monte Carlo. Therefore, it can be said to be more accurate when calculating the European type call option price at BBCA.JK stocks."
