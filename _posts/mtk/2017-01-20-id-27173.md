## Abstract:
"One of spatial regression model is Spatial Autoregressive (SAR), which assumes that the autoregressive process only on the dependent variable only by considering the spatial effects. There are two aspects of spatial effects, that is spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity. One of the problems which considers spatial effect is the spread of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF). Denpasar City is an endemic DHF disease because there have been DHF cases in three consecutive years or more. The purpose of this research is to estimate the spread of DHF in Denpasar City along with the factors that affect it. The results show that the factors that influence the spread of DHF are neighborhood, area and the role of Jumantik at the every village in Denpasar City."
