## Abstract:
"Mamdani Fuzzy is a method that interprets input values and makes conclusions based on IF-THEN rules and producing the output. In this research Mamdani fuzzy method is applied to determine the amount of round bread production at PT Vanessa Bakery. The step involve: determining the fuzzy system, the membership functions, as well as the fuzzy rules. The defuzzification process is applied to determine the amount of total production and to calculate the MAPE value of the Mamdani fuzzy method. The calculated MAPE as much as 5.94%, indicates this method has an excellent forecasting ability because the value is less than 10%. Thus, the Mamdani fuzzy method can be used at PT Vanessa Bakery."
