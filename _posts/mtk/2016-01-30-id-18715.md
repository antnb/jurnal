## Abstract:
"The aim of this research is to find the alternative solutions that could be used to handle the traffic congestions in the Denpasar City and the priorities of each alternative. The main problem of this research is determining the appropriateness of alternatives and its criterias that could be used to set the priorities of the alternatives. Based on the interview with the transport experts of Denpasar City, there are three main factors that affect the traffic congestion i.e (1) the ratio of the volume of vehicles on the road capacity, (2) the existing traffic management, and the traffic regulation . The interviewee also suggest that there are six alternatives that can be used to handle traffic congestion. These alternatives are (1)improve the public transport system, (2) use technology to monitor and enforce the rules,(3) create a 3 in 1 rule, (4) create road pricing rule,(5) optimize the existing management in the road, and (6) create rule of road zoning. Based on the calculations by Analytic Network Process (ANP) method, improving the public transport system is the best alternative among others that is appropriate to handle traffic congestion in the Denpasar City."
