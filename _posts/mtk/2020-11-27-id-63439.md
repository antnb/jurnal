## Abstract:
"Influence of radiation and non-uniform heat source on unsteady, magneto-hydrodynamic free convection flow of viscous incompressible fluid past an infinite vertical heated plate embedded in porous medium of an optically thin environment with time dependent suction and viscous dissipation is investigated in this paper. Analytical solutions of the coupled non-linear equations are obtained for the velocity field and temperature distribution using oscillating time-dependent perturbation technique. Expressions for skin-friction and heat transfer rate are also derived. The effects of the material parameters on velocity, temperature, skin-friction, and rate of heat transfer are discussed quantitatively."
