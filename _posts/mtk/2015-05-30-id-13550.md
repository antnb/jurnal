## Abstract:
"The aim of this research was to measure the risk of the IHSG stock data using the Value at Risk (VaR). IHSG stock index data typically indicates a jump. However, Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model can not catch any of the jumps. To view the jumps, it is necessary that the model was then developed into a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model with Jumps. On the GBM model with Jumps, returns the data are discontinuous. To determine the value of VaR, the value of return to perform the simulation model of GBM with Jumps is required. To represent processes that contain jumps, discontinuous Poisson process using the Peak-Over Threshold is required. To determine the parameters of model, calibration of historical data using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method is performed. VaR value for GBM model with Jumps with a 95% and 99% confidence level are -0,0580 and -0,0818 while VaR value for GBM model with a 95% and 99% confidence level are -0,0101 and -0,0199. VaR for GBM model with Jumps with a confidence level of 95% and 99% show greater than the model VaR for GBM."
