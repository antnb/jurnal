## Abstract:
"Missing data often occur in agriculture and animal husbandry experiment. The missing data in experimental design makes the information that we get less complete. In this research, the missing data was estimated with Yates method and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The basic concept of the Yates method is to minimize sum square error (JKG), meanwhile the basic concept of the EM algorithm is to maximize the likelihood function. This research applied Balanced Lattice Design with 9 treatments, 4 replications and 3 group of each repetition. Missing data estimation results showed that the Yates method was better used for two of missing data in the position on a treatment, a column and random, meanwhile the EM algorithm was better used to estimate one of missing data and two of missing data in the position of a group and a replication. The comparison of the result JKG of ANOVA showed that JKG of incomplete data larger than JKG of incomplete data that has been added with estimator of data. This suggest thatwe need to estimate the missing data."
