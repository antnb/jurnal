## Abstract:
"The aim of this research is to determine the relationship between environmental, behavioral, health services, education, and economic variables to health status in the Province of Bali. These variables are constructs (latents ) that can not be measured directly by observation. If there was a relationship between latent and its indicators, it is recomended to use Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). In this research we used variance-based SEM i.e. Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GSCA). This method not based on many assumptions such as the data does not have a multivariate normal distribution, the sample size does is not necessary large. Moreover, GSCA provides by overall goodness-fit of the model. The result of this research indicates that the environmental, behavioral, economic and educational variable influenced health status, but health service does not significantly affect the health status; economic does not significantly affect the environment; and education does not significantly affect the behavior. The result of the FIT value ?0.450 and the AFIT value 0.429 showed that overall model in this research is not good enough because of both of these values are under 0.50."
