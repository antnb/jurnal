Facing this problem, integrated marketing communication strategy is needed.This paper discusses implementation of integrated marketing communication concept created by Philip Kotler to the market ecotourism at Bali Botanical Garden, by using case study for qualitative research.The results of this analysis show that implementing this concept made a better relationship between Bali Botanical Garden and its visitors, also increasing quantity of its visitors."
