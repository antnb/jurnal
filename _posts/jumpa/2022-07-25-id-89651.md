"This research was designed to investigate the effect of tourist attraction and destination image on revisit intentions mediated by the memorable tourism experience at Jatiluwih Tourist Attraction.

Afterward, the analysis of Structural Equation Model (SEM) was conducted by using Smart-PLS 3.3. The result of this research indicates that: 1) Tourist attraction has significant effect on revisit intention. 2) Destination image has significant effect on revisit intention. 3) Tourist attraction has significant effect on memorable tourism experience. 4) Destination image has no significant effect on memorable tourism experience. 5) Memorable tourism experience has significant effect on revisit intention. 6) Tourist attraction has significant effect on revisit intention through memorable tourism experiences as a mediating variable. 7) Destination image has no significant effect on revisit intention through memorable tourism experiences as a mediating variable.
