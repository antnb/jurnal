The data werecollected through observation, interview, and documentary study,and then descriptively and qualitatively analyzed. The informantswere selected using the purposive sampling technique and theaccidental sampling technique.

The traditional arts were conserved and developed, andthe social organization were also well maintened. The economicaspects which includes job and business opportunities, incomeand investment have improved. The local people’s participationin the planning and controlling phases were manipulative andfunctional. In the development phase, the local people participatedactively. While tourist’s perception on subak is good, but that is notthe case on the poor condition of public facilities and informationservice by local management."
