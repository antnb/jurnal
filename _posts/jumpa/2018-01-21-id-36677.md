The results showed that CSR activities run by Nihiwatu Resort were not only incidental CSR but a sustainable one.The driving factors of CSR were as a form of moral obligation, to improve the company image, and to gain pro t. The social impacts were gaining government support and publicacceptance, proximity to health services; and easy access to clean water. Economic impacts include creating employment opportunities and improving economic structures.
