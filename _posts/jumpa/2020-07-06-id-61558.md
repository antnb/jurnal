The research method used was descriptive qualitative. The technique of determining informants using purposive sampling. Data collected through observation, interviews, and documentation. The results show that Denpasar biker travelers have some roles in promoting Batur UNESCO Global Geopark through activities on their motorbike communities such as, touring, sunmori (sunday morning ride), planting trees in tourist areas, Bali no trash challenge activities, and using features on Instagram social media (hashtag (#), tag people, tag location and caption) to share photos and videos of their trip. Biker travelers are identified in the type of dormant stakeholder. The characteristics of this stakeholders are people or groups who have little or no interaction/involvement.
