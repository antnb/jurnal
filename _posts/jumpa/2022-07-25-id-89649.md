This study aims to: 1) analyze the factors which influence the decision of visitors to travel and 2) analyze the most dominant factors that can influence the decision of visitors to travel to TSI during the Covid-19 pandemic. The design of this research was exploratory research with a quantitative approach with 140 respondents from TSI visitors who were determined based on purposive sampling in this study. The analytical method used was factor analysis using SPSS software version 28 for windows. The results showed that, there were 5 (five) factors that influence the decision to visit TSI during the Covid-19. First factor was a tourist attraction, then followed by psychological as second factor, experience as third factor while awards and special events as fourth factor and fifth factor. The most dominant factor that influence the visitor's decision to travel to TSI during the Covid-19 was psychological as a push factor. Meanwhile the pulling factor was tourist attraction. The implication of this research was providing additional information related to push and pull factors that influence visitor behaviour in making travel decisions.
