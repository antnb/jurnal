## Abstract:
"Demokrasi dalam kehidupan masyarakat moderen memberikan hak kepada warga negara untuk menyuarakan keinginan dan kepentingannya di muka umum, dan hal ini telah dijamin oleh konstitusi. Namun pihak yang terlibat seringkali melupakan bahwa semua ini wajib dilakukan dengan tertib, damai dan aman sehingga tidak jarang aksi ini justru berujung anarkis. Padahal jika setiap pihak yang terlibat mampu memahami hak dan tanggungjawab masing-masing dalam setiap tindakannya, hal semacam ini seharusnya tidak perlu terjadi. Karena pada dasarnya segala hal terkait tindakan warga negara maupun pihak kepolisian telah diatur tegas oleh Undang-Undang. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mendeskripsikan pelaksanaan tugas kepolisian dalam melaksanakan kewenangan mereka untuk mengamankan demonstrasi serta kendala yang dihadapinya. Dengan pendekatan perundang-undangan dan konsep, penelitian ini kemudian menggunakan metode penelitian hukum normatif, memakai bahan hukum primer, skunder, dan tersier. Kesimpulannya ditemukan bahwa kendala yang dihadapi Polri dalam menangani aksi unjuk rasa anarkis diantara lain adalah sulitnya aparat dalam memperkirakan banyaknya jumlah massa yang dapat berpotensi melakukan tidakan anarkis, sangat mudahnya medsos menyebarkan hoax, kurangnya Jumlah Personil Kepolisian, dan mudah meledaknya faktor psikologis dari pihak pengunjuk rasa. Kata kunci: Kepolisian, Unjuk Rasa, Anarkis ABSTRACT Democracy in modern society gives citizens the right to voice their wishes and interests in public, and this has been guaranteed by the constitution. However, the parties involved often forget that all of these must be done in an orderly, peaceful and safe manner, which is often these actions end in anarchy. In fact, if each party involved is able to understand their respective rights and responsibilities in each of their actions, this kind of thing should not have to happen. Because basically everything related to the actions of citizens and police has been strictly regulated by law. This study aims to describe the implementation of the police's duties in carrying out their authority to secure demonstrations and the obstacles they face. With a statutory and conceptual approach, this research then uses normative legal research, using primary, secondary, and tertiary legal materials. It was found that the obstacles faced by the Police in dealing with anarchist rallies were the difficulty of the apparatus in estimating the large number of masses who could potentially carry out anarchic actions, the ease with which social media spread hoaxes, the lack of police personnel, and the easy explosion of psychological factors on the part of the protesters. Keywords: Police, Demonstrations, Anarchy"
