## Abstract:
"Tujuan dari dilakukannya penelitian ini untuk mengetahui peran pemerintah dan lembaga yang bergerak di bidang perlindungan terhadap konsumen terkait produk kemasan kadaluarsa serta pertanggungjawaban dari para produsen atau pelaku usaha yang tidak bertanggungjawab akibat peredaran produk kemasan kadaluarsa. Jenis penelitian ini adalah penelitian Normatif. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan, masih banyak para pelaku usaha melakukan kecurangan dan tidak bertanggungjawab atas produknya yang sudah kadaluarsa dan pihak konsumen banyak tidak memperhatikan dan menyadari tanggal kadaluarsa dari produk makanan dan minuman tersebut. Pada dasarnya, perlindungan konsumen itu mempunyai arti sendiri seperti kaidah dan strategi yang mendapatkan jaminan dari kepastian hukum terhadap konsumen. Pada dasarnya, para konsumen mempunyai arti seperti pihak tertentu yang membayar untuk mendapatkan jasa atau produk dengan tujuan untuk memenuhi kebutuhan mereka masing-masing. Kebutuhan pokok manusia, yaitu makanan dan minuman, kedua hal tersebut merupakan bagian terpenting dari kehidupan manusia. Maka tak heran banyak orang yang sangat menjada pola makan hingga menerapkan pola hidup sehat. Terkadang beberapa orang banyak yang tidak memperhatikan tanggal dari kadaluarsa dari produk kemasan yang mereka konsumsi. Produk kemasan kadaluarsa merupakan “suatu kondisi dimana suatu produk pangan sudah dikatakan tidak layak karena sudah lewat waktu yang ditentukan layak pada kemasannya”. Pertanggungjawaban atas suatu produk khususnya produk makanan merupakan tanggung jawab dari pihak produsen selaku pelaku usaha dalam memberikan jaminan keamanan, baik pada proses perdagangan maupun proses pendistribusian produk makanan tersebut sampai pada tangan masyarakat selaku konsumen. Kata Kunci : Konsumen, Makanan dan Minuman, Kadaluarsa. ABSTRACT The purpose of this research is to find out the responsibilities of producers or business actors who are not responsible for the circulation of expired packaged products, as well as the role of the government and institutions engaged in consumer protection related to expired packaging products. This research use normative legal research. Where in fact, tbere are still many business actors who commit fraud and are not responsible for their expired products and many consumers do not pay attention and realize the expiration date of these food and beverage products. Basically, consumer protection has its own meaning such as rules and strategies that get guarantees from legal certainly to consumers. Basically, consumers have a meaning like certain parties who pay to get services or products with the aim of meeting their respective needs. Basically, humans need goods or service to meet their basic daily needs. So its not surprising that many people are very careful with their diet to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Sometimes many people do not pay attention to the expiration date of the packaged products the consume. Expired packaging products are “a condition where a food product is said to be unfit because it has passed the time specified on its packaging”. Accountability for a product, especially food products, is the responsibility of the producer as a business actor in providing security guarantees, both in the trading process and the distribution process of the food product until it reaches the hands of the community as consumers. Keywords : Consumer, Food and Beverage, Expiration."
