## Abstract:
"Tujuan ditulisnya penelitian ini untuk mengetahui bentuk penyelesaian perkara Kekerasan Seksual setelah lahirnya UU No. 12 Tahun 2022 Tentang Tindak Pidana Kekerasan Seksual yang kemudian akan dikaitkan dengan dengan pendekatan restorative justice. Dalam penelitian ini digunakan metode penelitian penelitian hukum normatif yaitu menggali menggunakan pendekatan berdasarkan undangundang. Didasarkan pada hasil penelitian didapatkan bahwa UU No. 12 Tahun 2022 Tentang Tindak Pidana Kekerasan Seksual tidak mencerminkan adanya kebijakan restorative justice sebagai penyelesaian perkara dengan pengecualian pada pelaku anak. Namun penyelesaian perkara dengan restorative justice memiliki potensi untuk diberlakukan pada kekerasan seksual dimasa mendatang. Dengan beberapa cacatan dalam pelaksanaannya, yaitu harus diikuti dengan persiapan yang matang dari segi peraturan pelaksanaan yang lebih menintik beratkan pada, pemulihan bukan penghentian perkara, persetujuan/kesiapan korban dan pengawasan berlanjut setelah keputusan dihasilkan. Hal tersebut kemudian harus diikuti dengan peningkatan mutu aparat penegak hukum yang menjadi mediator antara korban dan pelaku . Sehingga nantinya selain akan berdampak pada pemulihan psikis korban juga adanya kemungkinan pelaku menyelesai perbuatannya dan tidak menggulangi kejahatannya kembali. Kata kunci:, Restorative Justice, Kekerasan Seksual, Korban ABSTRACT The purpose of writing this research is to find out the form of settlement of cases of sexual violence after the enactment of Law no. 12 of 2022 concerning Crimes of Sexual Violence which will then be linked to a restorative justice approach. In this study, normative legal research research methods were used, namely exploring using an approach based on the law. Based on the research results, it was found that Law Number 12 of 2022 concerning Crimes of Sexual Violence does not reflect the existence of a restorative justice policy as a settlement of cases with the exception of child offenders. However, resolving cases with restorative justice has the potential to be applied to sexual violence in the future. With several defects in its implementation, which must be followed by careful preparation in terms of implementing regulations that focus more on recovery rather than termination of cases, approval/readiness of the victim and continuing supervision after a decision is made. This should then be followed by improving the quality of law enforcement officials who become mediators between victims and perpetrators. So that in addition to having an impact on the psychological recovery of the victim, there is also the possibility that the perpetrator will finish his actions and not repeat his crime again. Keywords:, Restorative Justice, Sexual Violence, Victim"
