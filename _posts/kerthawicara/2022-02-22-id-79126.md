"Tujuan studi ini untuk mengkaji pengaturan terkait perjanjian waralaba berdasarkan Peraturan Menteri Perdagangan Nomor 71 Tahun 2019 tentang Penyelenggaraan Waralaba serta untuk mengkaji prosedur pendaftaran perjanjian waralaba oleh penerima waralaba atau penerima waralaba lanjutan. Studi ini menggunakan metode penelitian hukum normatif dengan pendekatan perundang-undangan. Hasil studi menunjukkan bahwa perjanjian waralaba diatur dalam Peraturan Menteri Perdagangan Nomor 71 Tahun 2019 tentang Penyelenggaraan Waralaba. Peraturan tersebut mengatur bahwa perjanjian waralaba merupakan perjanjian tertulis antara para pihak, dibuat berdasar pada hukum Indonesia, dan ditulis dalam Bahasa Indonesia. Serta Peraturan Menteri ini melampirkan klausula-klausula yang diharuskan dimuat dalam perjanjian waralaba. Setelah perjanjian waralaba dibuat oleh para pihak, kemudian perjanjian tersebut wajib untuk didaftarkan. Pendaftaran perjanjian waralaba dilakukan oleh penerima waralaba atau penerima waralaba lanjutan. Berdasarkan Pasal 7 ayat (3) Peraturan Menteri Perdagangan Nomor 71 Tahun 2019 tentang Penyelenggaraan Waralaba diatur bahwa pendaftaran perjanjian waralaba dilaksanakan dengan cara mengajukan permohonan Surat Tanda Pendaftaran Waralaba, yang berdasar pada Peraturan Menteri ini.
