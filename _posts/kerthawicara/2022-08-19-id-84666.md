## Abstract:
"Penulisan ini dilakukan dengan tujuan pertama, mengetahui pengaturan hukum nasional khususnya pada hal ini adalah hukum agraria yang berkaitan dengan kegiatan jual beli pulau-pulau kecil yang dilakukan beberapa masyarakat di Indonesia. Kedua, untuk mengetahui keabsahan terhadap kegiatan jual- beli Pulau Lantigiang yang terjadi di awal tahun 2021. Tulisan ini mempergunakan metode penelitian normatif yang dimana metode ini adalah metode yang bertujuan untuk menemukan adanya prinsip, aturan, dan doktrin hukum dalam membahas permasalahan hukum yang sedang dihadapi. Hasil dari penelitian ini menunjukan kegiatan jual beli pulau kecil di wilayah Indonesia dapat dilakukan dengan memenuhi beberapa syarat yang salah satunya bukti kepemilikan dari pulau jelas serta kegiatan jual belinya dapat dikatakan sah. Pada kasus jual-beli Pulau Lantigiang yang dilakukan oleh Asdianti (AS) dengan Syamsul Alam (SA) dikatakan tidak memenuhi asas terang dan tunai sehingga dapat dikatakan kegiatan jual beli ini tidak sah. Selain itu bukti surat kepemilikan yang dimiliki oleh “SA” bukanlah sertifikat kepemilikan tanah yang dikeluarkan oleh pihak yang berwenang melainkan berupa selembar kertas dengan materai 6000 yang ditandatangani oleh kepala desa setempat terdahulu. Kegiatan jual-beli pulau yang dilakukan secara tidak sah akan menimbulkan kerugian bagi negara. Kata Kunci: Jual-Beli Pulau, Hak Tanah, Lantigiang ABSTRACT This study was conducted with the point of: first, knowing the national legal arrangements, especially in this case the Agrarian Law related to the buying and selling activities of small islands carried out by several people in Indonesia. Second, to find out the validity of the buying and selling activities on Lantigiang Island that occurred in early 2021. This study uses a normative juridical research method where this kind of research method is a research that aims to discover the existence of legal rules, principles, and doctrines in discussing legal issues being faced. The out come of this research exhibit that the buying and selling activities of small islands in Indonesia can be carried out by fulfilling several conditions, one of which is proof of ownership of the island and the sale and purchase activities can be legal. In the case of buying and selling on Lantigiang Island, which was carried out by the Asdianti (AS) with Syamsul Alam (SA), it was said that it did not meet the principle of light and cash, so it could be said that this buying and selling activity was not valid. In addition, the proof of ownership letter owned by SA is not a land ownership certificate issued by the competent authority but in the format of paper with 6000 stamp duty signed by the previous local village head. Island buying and selling activities that are carried out illegally will cause losses to the state. Keywords: Trading Island, Land Rights, Lantigiang"
