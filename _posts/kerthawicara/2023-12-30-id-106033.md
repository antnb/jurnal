Pembagian harta warisan dilihat menurut hukum perdata bahwa 1:1 untuk laki-laki serta perempuan seperti yang sudah dinyatakan dalam Pasal 852 Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Perdata. Sedangkan pembagian suatu harta warisan dilihat menurut hukum Islam bahwa laki-laki serta perempuan telah berbeda bagiannya dijelaskan bahwa laki-laki mendapat dua bagian serta perempuan mendapat satu bagian.
