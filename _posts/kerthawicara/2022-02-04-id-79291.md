## Abstract:
"Tujuan penulisan karya tulis ini untuk mengidentifikasi dan mengkaji bentuk perlindungan hukum terhadap konsumen serta untuk mengetahui tanggung jawab pelaku usaha terhadap konsumen dan penanggulangan terkait dengan adanya kenaikan harga penjualan hand sanitizer akibat penimbunan barang yang dilakukan saat pandemi virus Covid-19. Penulisan karya tulis ini menggunakan metode penelitian hukum normatif dengan pendekatan analisis bahan hukum berupa perundang-undangan (statute approach). Hasil yang dicapai dari penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa pelaku usaha tertentu yang menaikkan harga penjualan hand sanitizer dengan cara melakukan penimbunan barang tentu tidak sesuai isi dari Pasal 7 Undang-Undang Perlindungan Konsumen, yakni mengesampingkan kewajibannya untuk beritikad baik dalam menjalankan usahanya dan telah melanggar hak-hak yang dimiliki konsumen diantaranya tercantum dalam Pasal 4 Undang-Undang Perlindungan Konsumen sehingga konsumen merasa haknya telah dilanggar karena tidak memperoleh barang dengan harga yang sesuai serta keluhannya tidak didengar atas kenaikan harga hand sanitizer yang menyebabkan harganya sangat tidak terjangkau. Pentingnya penelitian ini dilakukan agar konsumen mengetahui hak-hak yang dimilikinya dan untuk memperoleh kepastian hukum. Kata Kunci: Perlindungan Konsumen, Pelaku Usaha, Tanggung Jawab ABSTRACT The purpose of writing this paper is to identify and examine forms of legal protection for consumers as well as to find out the responsibilities of business actors to consumers and countermeasures related to the increase in the selling price of hand sanitizers due to stockpiling of goods carried out during the Covid-19 virus pandemic. The writing of this paper uses a normative legal research method with an analytical approach to legal materials in the form of legislation (statute approach). The results achieved from this study indicate that certain business actors who increase the selling price of hand sanitizers by hoarding goods are certainly not in accordance with the contents of Article 7 of the Consumer Protection Act, which excludes the obligation to have good intentions in carrying out their business and have violated the rights of consumers including those stated in Article 4 of the Consumer Protection Act so that consumers feel their rights have been violated because do not get goods at the right price and their complaints are not heard over the increase in the price of hand sanitizers which makes the price very unaffordable.
