## Abstract:
"Penelitian mengenai upaya perlindungan hukum terhadap hak-hak anak korban dari perceraian orangtua ini dimaksudkan untuk mengetahui bagaimana pemenuhan terhadap hak-hak anak setelah terjadinya perceraian baik yang dilakukan oleh orangtua maupun oleh hukum positif Indonesia yang berlaku pada saat ini. Adapun metode penelitian dari penulisan ini adalah metode normatif yang di dapat dari hasil pendekatan terhadap Undang-Undang Nomor 1 Tahun 1974 tentang Perkawinan, dan Undang-Undang 23 Tahun 2002 tentang Perlindungan Anak guna mengetahui secara jelas dan gamblang mengenai upaya perlindungan hukum terhadap hak-hak anak pasca terjadinya perceraian. Dari hasil penelitian yang dilakukan oleh penulis, sekalipun telah diundangkan secara jelas tetapi implementasi perlindungan hukum terhadap anak pasca perceraian belum juga berjalan sebagaimana mestinya sehingga masih banyak sekali anak-anak yang tidak mendapat haknya secara penuh setelah terjadi perceraian antara kedua orangtua. Dan hal ini mengakibatkan timbulnya banyak permasalahan baru di kehidupan anak yang berdampak bagi tumbuh kembang mereka baik secara fisik maupun secara psikologis. Hasil yang dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui mengenai bagaimana bentuk perlindungan yang diberikan Undang-Undang terhadap hak anak pasca perceraian yaitu melalui tindakan preventif dan tindakan represif guna memberikan penegasan kepada orangtua agar tidak melalaikan tugas dan kewajibannya dalam pemenuhan hak anak. Kemudian apabila hak ini tidak terpenuhi seara baik dan sebagai mestinya, pengadilan dan lembaga hukum yang berwenang dapat memberikan sanksi dan melakukan pencabutan hak asuh oleh orangtua atas kelalaian mereka. Dalam pencabutan hak asuh, kewajiban anak terhadap orangtua masih tetap dan tidak berubah sehingga orangtua masih berkewajiban memenuhinya hingga anak beranjak dewasa. Kata kunci : Perceraian, Perlindungan hukum, Hak anak.

From the results of research conducted by the author, even though it has been clearly promulgated, the implementation of legal protection for children after divorce has not yet run as it should so that there are still a lot of children who do not get their rights in full after a divorce between the two parents.
