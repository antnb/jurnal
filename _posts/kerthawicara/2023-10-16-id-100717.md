"Tujuan penulisan ini ialah untuk memahami implementasi perjanjian hutang piutang atas dasar kepercayaan yang biasa disebut perjanjian lisan. Syarat sahnya sesuatu perjanjian, menurut pasal 1320 KUHperdata : Terdapat perkataan sepakat untuk mereka yang mengikatkan diri, Kecakapan kedua pihak teruntuk mengadakan sebuah perikatan, suatu hal tertentu dan suatu alasan. Metode penelitian yang digunakan didalam penulisan ini ialah penelitian hukum normatif yang melibatkan analisis bahan hukum seperti Undang-undang, doktrin serta sumber hukum sekunder. Putusan kasus wanprestasi yakni antar soekotjo serta melyani (tergugat). Melyani membantah jumlah pinjaman yang digugat Soekotjo karena dianggap tidak pantas. Walau, hakim memutuskan Melyani melakukan pelanggaran. Perjanjian lisan mempunyai kekuatan hukum, sepanjang terbukti dibuat dengan dua pihak serta sudah terpenuhnya syarat sah perjanjiannya yang diatur didalam Pasal 1320 KUH Perdata. Kata Kunci : Kontrak, perjanjian lisan, pelanggaran kontrak. ABSTRACT The purpose of this paper is to understand the implementation of credit agreements on the basis of trust which are commonly called oral agreements. According to article 1320 of the Civil Code, the legal requirements for an agreement are: There is an agreement for those who are bound, the ability of both parties to enter into an agreement, a certain matter and a reason. The research method used in this paper is normative legal research which involves analysis of legal materials such as laws, doctrines and secondary sources of law. The verdict in the default case was between Soekotjo and Melyani (defendant). Melyani disputed the loan amount that Soekotjo was suing because it was considered inappropriate. However, the judge decided that Melyani had committed an offence. An oral agreement has legal force, as long as it is proven that it was made by two parties and the legal terms of the agreement have been fulfilled as regulated in Article 1320 of the Civil Code. Keywords : Legal, verbal agreement, contract betrayal."
