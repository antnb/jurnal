## Abstract:
"Penulisan artikel ini bertujuan karakteristik dari hubungan hukum pelaku usaha paid promote serta untuk mengkaji serta memahami lebih dalam lagi mengenai pengaturan tantang tanggung jawab hukum. Metode penelitian yang digunakan dalam penulisan ini menggunakan metode penelitian hukum normatif yakni dengan studi kepustakaan. Sepanjang penulisan ini juga menggunakan pendekatan perundang-undangan serta pendekatan konseptual untuk dapat mengalisis lebih tajam lagi secara yuridis. Hasil dari penelitian ini menunjukan bahwa hubungan hukum yang terjalin antara pelaku usaha paid promote melalui Instagram terbentuk karena adanya perjanjian. Disini pelaku usaha paid promote disebut dengan pengguna jasa dan penyedia jasa paid promote. Perjanjian paid promote merupakan pengembangan dari bentuk perjanjian yang biasanya. Namun dalam pembuatannya haruslah tetap berpegang teguh pada syarat sahnya perjanjian sebagaimana termuat dalam Pasal 1320 KUHPerdata. Dengan lahirnya perjanjian, maka lahir pula yang namanya tanggung jawab hukum. Apabila penyedia jasa melakukan wanprestasi atas perjanjian tersebut, maka ia memiliki tanggung jawab hukum yang wajib dipenuhi sebagaimana yang bentuk-bentuknya sudah termuat dalam peraturan perundang-undangan dan pada perjanjian itu sendiri. Kata Kunci: Tanggung Jawab Hukum, Paid Promote, Instagram. ABSTRACT The purpose of this article is to study and understand more deeply about the regulation of legal responsibility and to examine how the characteristics of the legal relationship of promoted business actors. The research method used in this paper uses normative legal research methods, namely literature study. During this writing, he also uses a statutory approach as well as a conceptual approach to be able to analyze more sharply juridically. The results of this study indicate that the legal relationship that exists between business actors being promoted through Instagram is formed because of an agreement. Here, promoted business actors are called service users and promoted service providers. The paid promote agreement is an extension of the usual form of the agreement. Notwithstanding, in making it one should adhere to the legitimacy states of the understanding as contained in Article 1320 of the Civil Code. With the introduction of the understanding, the name of legitimate duty was conceived. Assuming the specialist organization defaults on the understanding, the person in question has a lawful duty that should be satisfied as the structures are contained in the laws and guidelines and in the actual arrangement. Key Words: Liability and Paid Promote, Instagram."
