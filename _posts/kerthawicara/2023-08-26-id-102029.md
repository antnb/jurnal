## Abstract:
"Tujuan penulisan karya ilmiah ini untuk memahami pengaturan hukum mengenai syarat pendirian Perseroan Terbatas Perorangan dan menganalisis implikasi yang dapat ditimbulkan apabila dihapusnya nominal batas minimal modal dari pendirian Perseroan Terbatas Perorangan dalam Undang-Undang Nomor 6 Tahun 2023 Tentang Penetapan Peraturan Pemerintah Pengganti Undang-Undang Nomor 2 Tahun 2022 Tentang Cipta Kerja. Dalam mengkaji tulisan ilmiah ini menggunakan metode normatif yang utamanya mempergunakan metode pendekatan dari suatu peraturan perundang-undangan yang disebut sebagai (statute approach), dan pendekatan konseptual (conceptual approach). Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa ada beberapa persyaratan pendirian Perseroan Terbatas diubah pengaturannya kedalam Undang-Undang Cipta Kerja. Dalam pengaturannya yang baru, Perseroan Terbatas mengenal konsepsi baru yakni Perseroan Terbatas dengan persekutuan modal dan Perseroan Terbatas Perorangan. Ketentuan mengenai Perseoran Terbatas Perorangan dengan persyaratan yang diatur yakni pertama, kepemilikan Perseroan yang hanya dapat dimiliki oleh satu orang saja, kedua pendirian Perseroan dapat dilakukan dengan pembuatan surat pernyataan pendirian, ketiga didaftarkan secara elektronik kepada Menteri. UU Cipta Kerja juga menghapus batas minimal modal pendirian perseroan, implikasi yang ditimbulkan yakni disatu sisi guna meningkatkan pelaku usaha dengan mempermudah upaya legalitas menjadi bentuk badan hukum, disatu sisi pula ketentuan ini tidak memberikan kepastian dan jaminan terhadap pembayaran piutang kepada pihak ketiga jika adanya pinjaman. Kata Kunci: Modal Minimal, Perseroan Terbatas Perorangan, Undang-Undang Cipta Kerja ABSTRACT The purpose of writing this scientific paper is to understand the legal arrangements regarding the requirements for establishing a Individual Limited Liability Company and to analyze the implications that can arise if the nominal minimum capital limit for the establishment of a Individual Limited Liability Company is removed in Law Number 6 of 2023 concerning Stipulation of Government Regulation in Lieu of Law Number 2 of 2022 About Job Creation. In reviewing this scientific paper using a normative method which mainly uses the approach method from a statutory regulation which is referred to as (statute approach), and a conceptual approach (conceptual approach). The results of this study indicate that there are several requirements for the establishment of a Limited Liability Company that have been modified into the Job Creation Law. In its new arrangement, a Limited Liability Company recognizes a new conception, namely a Limited Liability Company with capital partnerships and an Individual Limited Liability Company. Provisions regarding Individual Limited Liability Companies with the conditions set forth are first, the ownership of a Company which can only be owned by one person, secondly the establishment of a Company can be done by making a statement of establishment, thirdly it is registered electronically to the Minister. The Job Creation Law also abolished the minimum capital limit for company establishment, the implications that arise are that on the one hand it is to increase business actors by facilitating legality efforts to form legal entities, on the one hand this provision does not provide certainty and guarantees for the payment of receivables to third parties if there is a loan. Key Words: Minimal Capital, Individual Limited Liability Company, Job Creation Law"
