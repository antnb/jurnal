## Abstract:
"Penulisan ini bertujuan untuk menguraikan perlindungan hukum bagi nasabah bank terhadap adanya tindak pidana skimming serta menganalisa batasan tanggung jawab bank terhadap kerugian nasabah yang timbul dari tindak pidana skimming. Penulisan ini menggunakan metode penelitian normatif yakni menggunakan studi kepustakaan untuk mengkaji norma atau peraturan hukum yang relevan dengan topik yang dikaji berkaitan dengan ketidakpastian hukum dari pengaturan hukum terhadap tanggungjawab bank dalam menyelesaikan permasalahan jika terjadi kerugian dari nasabah akibat tindakan skimming. Pendekatan perundang-undangan serta pendekatan konsep hukum digunakan pada penelitian ini. Serta pada teknik penelusuran bahan hukum yang dipakai adalah teknik studi terhadap dokumen–dokumen yang ada serta analisis kajiannya merupakan analisis kualitatif. Hasil studi menunjukan bahwa Perlindungan konsumen bagi nasabah bank tertuang pada UU Perlindungan Konsumen dan UU Perbankan. Terdapat kewajiban bagi pihak bank yaitu mengurangi resiko ataupun dapat mencegah timbulnya kerugian materil yang dialami oleh nasabah yang dikarenakan kurang optimalnya upaya keamanan dari pihak bank sehingga nasabah berhak atas pembelaan hukum, dan perlindungan berupa penggantian kerugian. Serta berkaitan dengan terjadinya tindakan skimming maka berdasarkan pada UU Perlindungan Konsumen, dalam pasal 7 termaktub pada pokoknya menentukan adanya kewajiban pelaku usaha yang berlandas pada itikad baik untuk menjamin bahwa setiap pelayanan yang diperuntukan bagi nasabah akan terjamin mutu barang dan/atau jasanya untuk diperdagangkan berdasar pada ketentuan standar mutu yang berlaku. Serta telah jelas selanjutnya pada pasal tersebut bahwa setiap kerugian yang timbul dari pemakaian atau pemanfaatan barang dan/atau jasa maka akan diberikan kompensasi, ganti rugi dan/atau penggantian atas kerugian yang diberikan oleh pihak pelaku usaha.

This writing uses normative research methods, namely using literature studies to examine legal norms or regulations that are relevant to the topic studied related to legal uncertainty from legal arrangements to bank responsibility in solving problems in the event of losses from customers due to skimming actions. The statutory approach and the legal concept approach are used in this study. As well as the technique of tracing legal materials used is a technique of studying existing documents and the analysis of the study is a qualitative analysis. The results of the study show that consumer protection for bank customers is contained in the Consumer Protection Act and the Banking Law. There is an obligation for the bank, namely reducing risk or preventing material losses experienced by customers due to less than optimal security efforts from the bank so that customers are entitled to legal defense, and protection in the form of compensation. As well as relating to the occurrence of skimming actions, based on the Consumer Protection Law, Article 7, it is stated in principle that it is stated that there is an obligation for business actors based on good faith to ensure that every service intended for customers will guarantee the quality of their goods and/or services to be traded based on applicable quality standards. It is also clear further in the article that any loss arising from the use or utilization of goods and/or services will be given compensation, compensation and/or compensation for losses provided by the business actor.
