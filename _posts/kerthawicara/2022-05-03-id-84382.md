## Abstract:
"Perkembangan teknologi sangat mempengaruhi alat pembayaran di Indonesia sehingga memunculkan alat pembayaran baru yaitu uang elektronik. Pengaturan uang elektronik belum mengatur mengenai keamanan dalam penggunaan uang elektronik jika terjadi hal-hal yang tidak diinginkan seperti dicuri dan hilang, hal ini bertentangan dengan tujuan dibentuknya peraturan uang elektronik dalam penyelenggaraan uang elektronik yang aman dan adanya penguatan terhadap prinsip perlindungan konsumen sehingga perlu adanya konstruksi norma dalam peraturan tersebut. Fokus permasalahan dalam hal ini bagaimana karakteristik uang elektronik sebagai alat pembayaran yang sah dan konstruksi norma hukum untuk melindungi pemilik atas hilangnya uang elektronik sebagai alat pembayaran yang sah. Metode penelitian yang digunakan dalam penulisan ini adalah metode penelitian yuridis-normatif yang memiliki arti penelitian hukum kepustakaan dengan mencari jawaban atas rumusan masalah yang ada dengan cara meneliti bahan-bahan kepustakaan sebagai data primer dan sekunder. Hasil studi menunjukan Karakteristik uang elektronik dapat dipersamakan dengan uang kertas dan uang logam yang tidak memiliki keamanan dalam penggunaannya, uang elektronik dapat ditingkatkan keamanannya dikarenakan uang elektronik menggunakan sistem elektronik dalam penggunaannya tidak seperti uang kertas dan uang logam, pemanbahan fitur-fitur dalam uang elektronik dapat meningkatkan keamanan dalam penggunaan uang elektronik dengan cara mengkonstruksi ulang Peraturan Bank Indonesia Nomor 20/6/PBI/2018 tentang Uang Elektronik pada Pasal 46 dengan menambahkan fitur pemblokiran, dan fitur pelacakan. Kata Kunci: Karakteristrik, Uang Elektronik, Konstruksi Norma, Fitur ABSTRACT Technological developments greatly affect payment instruments in Indonesia, giving rise to a new payment instrument, namely electronic money.
