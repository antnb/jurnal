## Abstract:
"Eksperimen medis yang dilakukan pemerintahan Nazi Jerman ketika Perang Dunia II (PD II) sangatlah kejam dan melukai hati nurani masyarakat internasional. Hingga saat PD II berakhir, para penjahat perang tersebut diadili di Pengadilan Nuremberg, khususnya Doctors’ Trial. Berbeda dengan saat Perang Irak, dimana AS menginvasi Irak dan banyak melakukan pelanggaran berat, termasuk eksperimen medis yang dilakukan terhadap tawanan perang Irak. Tujuan dari penulisan ini untuk mengetahui bagaimana perbandingan penyelesaian kasus tindakan eksperimen medis saat PD II dan Perang Irak dan mengetahui apa sanksi yang dapat dihadapi AS. Kedua masalah dianalisis menggunakan metode penelitian normatif dengan pendekatan perundang – undangan yang mengacu pada hukum pidana internasional dan hukum humaniter internasional. Hasil penelitian dan analisis menunjukkan bahwa penyelesaian kasus tindakan eksperimen medis saat PD II lebih efektif karena para penjahat perang diadili dan dihukum saat diadili di Pengadilan Nuremberg, namun tidak dengan AS, yang hanya menghukum para pelaku yang terlibat dalam tindakan penyiksaan tersebut dalam pengadilan militernya sendiri tanpa bisa diadili di ICC, yang sesungguhnya ICC memiliki wewenang untuk mengadili kejahatan yang dilakukan tentara AS tersebut. AS hanya mencari, mengadili, dan menghukum para pelaku dengan dikenai sanksi administrasi dan hukuman pidana penjara. Kata Kunci : eksperimen medis, tawanan perang, kejahatan perang, kejahatan terhadap kemanusiaan. ABSTRACT Medical experiments carried out by the Nazi Germany during World War II (WW II) were very cruel and hurt the conscience of the international community. At the end of WW II, the war criminals were tried in the Nuremberg Trial, especially Doctors' Trial. In contrast to the time of the Iraq War, where the US invaded Iraq and committed many serious violations, including medical experiments conducted on Iraqi prisoners of war. The purpose of this study is to find out how to compare the resolution of cases of medical experimental during WW II and the Iraq War and find out what punishments can be faced by the US. Both problems are analyzed using normative research methods with a statutory approach that refers to international criminal law and international humanitarian law. The results of research and analysis show that the resolution of cases of medical experimental during WW II was more effective because war criminals were tried and convicted when tried at the Nuremberg Trial, but not with the US, which only punished the perpetrators involved in torture in their own military court without can be tried at the ICC, which in fact ICC has the authority to prosecute crimes committed by the US army. The US only seeks, hears, and punishes perpetrators with administrative sanctions and imprisonment. Keywords : medical experiments, prisoners of war, war crimes, crimes against humanity."
