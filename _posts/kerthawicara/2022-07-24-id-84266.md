## Abstract:
"Penulisan artikel ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui predatory pricing yang dilarang oleh Undang- Undang Nomor 5 Tahun 1999 Tentang Larangan Praktik Monopoli dan Persaingan Usaha Tidak Sehat (UU Anti Monopoli) yang selanjutnya menjadi landasan untuk mengetahui flash sale Shopee termasuk dalam predatory pricing serta untuk mengetahui sanksi terhadap pelaku usaha terkait predatory pricing. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode penelitian hukum normatif dengan menggunakan pendekatan perundang-undangan. Hasil studi menunjukkan bahwa yang termasuk dalam kegiatan predatory pricing apabila telah memenuhi unsur-unsur yang dilarang oleh UU Anti Monopoli. Unsur-unsur yang dilarang oleh UU Anti Monopoli adalah kegiatan jual beli yang dilakukan oleh pelaku usaha dengan menetapkan harga jauh lebih murah yang bertujuan untuk mematikan usaha pesaingnya dalam upaya menetapkan posisinya sebagai monopolis dan perbuatan predatory pricing tersebut sudah dibuktikan Komisi Pengawas Persaingan Usaha (KPPU). Flash sale Shopee tidak termasuk dalam predatory pricing karena tidak memenuhi unsur-unsur yang dilarang oleh UU Anti Monopoli melainkan hanya sebagai media promosi dan meningkatkan brand awareness agar semakin dikenal publik. Sanksi terhadap pelaku usaha terkait predatory pricing yaitu pelaku usaha dapat dikenakan sanksi berupa tindakan administratif, sanksi pidana pokok dan sanksi pidana tambahan. Kata Kunci: Predatory Pricing, Flash Sale, Shopee, Persaingan Usaha Tidak Sehat.
