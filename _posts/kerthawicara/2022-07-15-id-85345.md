## Abstract:
"Tujuan penelitian ini agar dapat diketahui syarat penegakan hukum persaingan bisnis online di Indonesia. Undang-Undang Nomor 5 Tahun 1999 hingga kini belum mempunyai ketentuan khusus mengenai e-commerce. Adapun metode penelitian yang dipergunakan dalam mengumpulkan data yakni penelitian hukum yuridis normatif yang memposisikan hukum sebagai bangunan dari sistem norma. Adapun definisi sistem norma yaitu norma, asas, serta pedoman dari aturan perundang-undangan, dan ajaran. Kini industri digital kian bergerilya di sejumlah bidang usaha, dari e-commerce hingga fintech. Para pelaku industrinya tak hanya domestic namun juga asing yang turut ikut serta dalam perekonomian digital. Tugas KPPU seperti yang tertuang pada ketentuan tersebut memberi kewenangan dalam memantau aktivitas usaha, termasuk pula usaha pada platform digital. Maka dari itu, para pengusaha e-commerce asing harus patuh pada aturan hukum persaingan usaha di Indonesia, tetapi masih saja ada pengusaha e-commerce asing yang berpraktik anti persaingan di luar daerah teritorial negara Indonesia. Dalam hal ini seharusnya tidak hanya semata-mata mengatur hubungan bisnis tetapi harus berorientasi pada pengaturan dimensi elektronik. Kata Kunci: Penegakan Hukum, Persaingan Bisnis, E-Commerce ABSTRACT The purpose of this research is to know the requirements for law enforcement on online business competition in Indonesia. Law Number 5 of 1999 does not yet have specific provisions regarding e-commerce. The research method used in collecting data is normative juridical law research that positions law as the building of the norm system. The definition of the norm system is norms, principles, and guidelines from laws and regulations, and teachings. Now the digital industry is increasingly guerrilla in a number of business fields, from e-commerce to fintech. The industry players are not only domestic but also foreign who participate in the digital economy. The KPPU's duties as stated in the provision provide the authority to monitor business activities, including businesses on digital platforms. Therefore, foreign e-commerce entrepreneurs must comply with the rules of business competition law in Indonesia, but there are still foreign e-commerce entrepreneurs who practice anti-competition outside the territory of the Indonesian state. In this case, it should not only regulate business relations but must be oriented towards regulating the electronic dimension. Key Words: Law Enforcement, Business Competition, E-Commerce"
