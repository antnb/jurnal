## Abstract:
"Tulisan ini hendak menganalisis perbantuan hukum sebagaimana termaktub dalam UU 16/11 sebagai salah langkah dan proses pengalaman asas equality before the law yang meresap dalam konsepsi Indonesia sebagai negara hukum untuk kemudian ditinjau dari implementasi pemberian bantuan hukum yang didasarkan pada pengamalan asas equality before the law. Demi tercapainya tujuan tersebut, dipergunakanlah jenis penelitian normatif dengan memadukan studi kepustakaan sebagai bentuk kesatuan substansial dari tulisan ini. Hasil studi yang diperoleh adalah Pasal 1 ayat (3) UUD 1945 menerangkan dengan tegas bahwa selayaknya negara dengan landasan hukum kuat, Indonesia menjunjung tinggi hak asasi manusia. Salah satu bentuk pengamalannya adalah dengan adanya asas equality before the law yang mana dalam hal kemudahan akses bantuan hukum bagi warga negara Indonesia, maka negara menjamin hal tersebut melalui peraturan perundangan yakni Undang-Undang Bantuan Hukum. Bentuk jaminan terlaksananya kemudahan akses bantuan hukum meliputi ruang lingkup yaitu bantuan akses hukum berupa pendampingan oleh pengacara dan/atau pelaksanaan bantuan hukum lainnya sesuai dengan kepentingan dan kebutuhan penerima bantuan hukum tersebut. Studi ini juga mendapati bahwa tujuan negara akan diberikannya bantuan hukum lewat UU 16/11 dilandasi oleh penjaminan hak penerima bantuan hukum untuk mendapatkan akses keadilan yang rata dan tidak pandang bulu. Kata Kunci: Equality Before the Law, Negara Hukum, Bantuan Hukum. ABSTRACT This paper wants to analyze legal aid as contained in Law 16/11 as one of the steps and processes of experience of the principle of equality before the law which is pervasive in the conception of Indonesia as a state of law to then be reviewed from the implementation of the provision of legal aid based on the practice of the principle of equality before the law. In order to achieve this goal, a type of normative research is used by combining literature studies as a form of substantial unity of this paper. The result of the study obtained is Article 1 paragraph (3) of the 1945 Constitution explains unequivocally that as a country with a strong legal foundation, Indonesia upholds human rights. One form of practice is the principle of equality before the law which in terms of easy access to legal aid for Indonesian citizens, the state guarantees this through laws and regulations, namely the Legal Aid Law. The form of guarantee for the implementation of easy access to legal aid includes the scope of legal access assistance in the form of assistance by lawyers and / or the implementation of other legal assistance in accordance with the interests and needs of the recipients of legal aid. The study also found that the state's goal of providing legal aid through Law 16/11 is based on guaranteeing the rights of legal aid recipients to have equal and indiscriminate access to justice. Keywords: Equality Before the Law, State of Law, Legal Aid."
