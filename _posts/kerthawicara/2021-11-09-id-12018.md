Based on Chapter X Laws and Regulation Number 29 Year 2004concerning Medical Practice, doctors are sentenced criminal verdict in matters legally due toadministrative problem such as non-possession of registration number. Based on an analysis,doctors are to be criminalized upon certain condition which are violation against the law,errors during practice, capability of being responsible, and the absence of underlyingexcuses to undo the penalty. It is expected for doctors to work carefully, attentively,benevolently to avoid or at least minimize error.
