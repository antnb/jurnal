## Abstract:
"Penelitian ini dilakukan untuk mengkaji kebijakan asimilasi serta hak integrasi di masa pandemi Covid-19. Dalam penelitian ini, kajian atau metode yang digunakan adalah metode hukum normatif dengan pendekatan melalui peraturan perundang-undangan yang berlaku (Statute Approach) serta pendekatan konseptual (Conceptual Approach). Peraturan Menteri Hukum dan HAM (Permenkumham) No 10 Tahun 2020 menjadi bahan hukum yang dijadikan dasar dalam penelitian ini serta beberapa peraturan lainnya yang menjadi peraturan pendukung untuk menunjang hasil penelitian ini. Teknik pengumpulan yang dipergunakan dalam penelitian ini ialah studi kepustakaan atau library research yang dimana teknik tersebut dipergunakan dengan cara pengumpulan dan pengkajian terhadap peraturan perundang-undangan. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukan bahwa penerapan asimilasi dan hak integrasi kurang baik dilakukan di tengah-tengah masa pandemi Covid-19, terbukti dengan dikeluarkannya beberapa orang narapidana di lingkungan masyarakat. Berdasarkan keterangan yang disampaikan oleh Ahmad Ramadhan yang menyatakan tercatat ada 140 kasus kejahatan yang dilakukan kembali oleh narapidana asimilasi. Hal ini tentunya membuat masyarakat resah diantaranya mencuri, memperkosa, pembegalan hingga pembunuhan yang tentu saja ini kurang efektif dilakukan pada para narapidana dengan berbagai kasus. Kata Kunci: Asimilasi, Hak Integrasi, Narapidana, Masa Pademi, Covid-19. ABSTRACT This research was conducted to examine the policy of assimilation and integration rights during the Covid-19 pandemic. In this study, the study or method used is a normative legal method with an approach through the applicable laws and regulations (Statute Approach) and a conceptual approach (Conceptual Approach). Regulation of the Minister of Law and Human Rights (Permenkumham) No. 10 of 2020 is the legal material that is used as the basis for this research as well as several other regulations that become supporting regulations to support the results of this research. The collection technique used in this research is library research, in which the technique is used by collecting and reviewing statutory regulations. The results of this study indicate that the implementation of assimilation and integration rights is not well carried out in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, as evidenced by the release of several prisoners in the community. Based on the information provided by Ahmad Ramadhan, who stated that there were 140 cases of crimes committed by assimilation prisoners. This of course makes the community restless, including stealing, raping, beheading to murder, which of course is less effective for convicts with various cases. Keywords: Assimilation, Integration Rights, Prisoners, Pandemic, Covid-19."
