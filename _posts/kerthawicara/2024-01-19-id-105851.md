## Abstract:
"ABSTRAK Penelitian bertujuan untuk mengetahui pengaturan hukum terhadap penyesuaian bidang usaha dan izin usaha Perseroan Terbatas di Indonesia serta mengetahui faktor-faktor yang menjadi dasar pertimbangan Pemerintah Provinsi DKI Jakarta dalam mencabut izin usaha PT. XYZ. Metode penelitian ini menggunakan pendekatan hukum empiris, merupakan jenis penelitian dimana hukum tidak semata-mata dipandang sebagai disiplin yang dogmatis, namun juga praktikal atau kenyataan hukum. Hasil yang didapat menunjukkan bahwa berdasarkan Pasal 1 Angka 7 PP No. 24 Tahun 2018, harus dilakukan pendaftaran secara mandiri mengenai kegiatan usaha melalui OSS RBA setelah proses akta pendirian Perseroan selesai dilakukan di hadapan Notaris. Kemudian mengenai kasus yang menimpa PT. XYZ, telah diuraikan faktor-faktor yang membuat izin usaha PT. XYZ yang dicabut oleh Pemprov DKI Jakarta, dimana terdapat ketidaksesuaian perizinan di OSS RBA dengan akta dan kegiatan usaha Perseroan yang dijalankan di lapangan. PT. XYZ yang melakukan kegiatan usaha Bar hanya memiliki sertifikasi KBLI nomor 47221, yaitu kode untuk bidang usaha Perdagangan Eceran Minuman Beralkohol. Sementara bidang usaha bar telah terverifikasi dalam KBLI nomor 56301 dan seharusnya wajib tercantum dalam akta Perseroan PT. XYZ dan terdaftar dalam OSS RBA Kata Kunci: Izin Usaha, Perseroan Terbatas, Online Single Submission. ABSTRACT The aim of this research is to find out the legal regulations regarding adjustments to business fields and business permits for Limited Liability Companies in Indonesia and to find out the factors that are the basis for consideration by the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government in revoking the business permits of PT. XYZ. This research method uses an empirical legal approach, which is a type of research where law is not merely seen as a dogmatic discipline, but also practical or legal reality. The results obtained show that based on Article 1 Number 7 PP No. 24 of 2018, independent registration of business activities must be carried out through the OSS RBA after the Company's deed of establishment process has been completed before a Notary. Then regarding the case that happened to PT. XYZ, the factors that make the permit of PT. XYZ was revoked by the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government, where there was a discrepancy between the permits in the RBA OSS and the Company's deeds and business activities carried out in the field. PT. XYZ, which carries out bar business activities, only has Standard Classification of Indonesian Business Fields (KBLI) certification number 47221, which is the code for the Alcoholic Drinks Retail Trade business sector. Meanwhile, the bar business sector has been verified in KBLI number 56301 and should be listed in the PT Company deed.
