## Abstract:
"ABSTRACT Advertisement is a form of activity to promote an idea, product, or service that is conveyed by persuasion, one of them is by showing the aesthetic beauty of women. Beauty is pictured as a woman with slim waist, fair skin, and with long dark straight hair. However, the stereotype of beauty has been changing these days as shown in a Doveadvertisement Beragam Kecantikan Satu Indonesia version. By using qualitative research methods with the constructivist paradigm and Roland Barthesâ€™ semiotics analysis, the researcher found a different construction of beauty in a Doveadvertisement Beragam Kecantikan Satu Indonesia version. The concept of beauty that is constructed in this advertisement refers to variety of women&#x27;s beauty. It can be seen at the variety of sizes, hair styles, skin color, and age that is portrayed in this advertisement. This shows that the post-modern concept of beauty is referring to plurality, heterogeneity, and very subjective. Key Words : Advertisement, Beauty, Construction, Women, Semiotics"
