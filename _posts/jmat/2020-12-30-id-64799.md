The result shows that Keboansikep, Sawotratap, Tebel, Keboananom, Gedangan, Keboguyang, Ketajen, Sidomulyo, Terik, Ponokawan, Sedengan Mijen, and Barengkrajan villages are the most potential villages in Sidoarjo. Based on the classification method, it is found that the villages of Keboansikep, Sawotratap, Tebel, Keboananom, Gedangan, and Ketajen (Gedangan District) have local potential in the form of agricultural factors such as rice and secondary crops.

Meanwhile, the villages of Sidomulyo, Terik, Ponokawan, Sedengan Mijen, and Barengkrajan (Krian District) have high early childhood education factors such as kindergarten students, kindergarten teachers, and kindergarten schools Keywords: Data Mining, Local Potential, Biplot analysis"
