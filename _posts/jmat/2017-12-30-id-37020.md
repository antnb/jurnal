The main objective of the research that classifies 33 provinces based on the value of regional gross domestic product at constant price in 2013 using hierarchical cluster analysis for average linkage method. The results showed that the cluster were carried out on 33 provinces in Indonesia formed 3 cluster with details of that cluster 1 consisting of Sumatera, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, Bali, Papua, Maluku and Jawa Tengah, DI Yogyakarta, and Banten, cluster 2 consisting of 1 provinces of DKI Jakarta and cluster 3 which consists of 2 provinces namely Jawa Barat dan Jawa Timur."
