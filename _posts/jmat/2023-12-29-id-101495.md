## Abstract:
"In most cases, clinicians do not use the ICD-10 standard established by the WHO for diagnosing diseases. These issues may result in outcomes that are undesirable from the standpoints of patient safety and the law. The WHO ICD-10 standard collection of diagnoses that can’t be effectively searched using MySQL’s native search mechanism. Therefore, in order to automatically produce several keywords for each ICD-10 code, academics are interested in analyzing the natural language analysis of WHO ICD-10 data. When diagnosing illnesses, it is envisaged that the availability of numerous types of keywords can lead to more fruitful search results. Natural language analysis, a technique for removing stop words from sentences and simultaneously assessing the semantics of the language from which the keywords will be extracted, makes it possible to do this. Keywords: Natural Language Analysis ; ICD-10 ; Stop Words ; Semantics."
