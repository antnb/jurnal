## Abstract:
"Abstract: Covid-19 which entered Indonesia in December 2019 has a significant impact on the aviation industry. According to BPS data for 2020, the aviation industry's contribution to Indonesia's GDP decreased from 1.21% to 0.28% in the second quarter of 2020. To overcome this setback, comprehensive monitoring by policy makers is needed. The use of big data in monitoring aviation industry activities can be an option. This study aims to analyze aviation activities using big data approach for monitoring basis. The data was collected by using web scraping method on one of the global aviation websites to obtain flight status data at 108 airports in Indonesia on April 2020 until June 2021. Other data used are google mobility index data, GDP data, and TPK. The analysis method used are descriptive analysis, correlation analysis and machine learning based time series modelling with ARNN, single layer ANN and MLP. The results show that the policy of restricting mobility has a significant effect on the productivity of aviation industry. Machine learning modeling shows that the MLP model is the best model for forecasting international aviation activity. In addition, it was found that the aviation industry has a strong correlation with the economy and tourism sector in Indonesia."
