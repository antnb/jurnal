## Abstract:
"Almost all statistical procedures, especially statistical inference, assumed that the sample distribution isnormally distributed. This normality assumption must be tested to ensure the correct use of the teststatistic, hence resulting a correct conclusion. This research discusses some univariate normality tests:test based on empirical distribution function, test based on moments, test based on correlation orregression, test based on sample entropy, test based on kernel method, test based on Polyacharacteristics, and test based on nonparametric method. This research also discuss normality test thatcapable of detecting outliers and discuss omnibus test that can give additional information about nonnormality."
