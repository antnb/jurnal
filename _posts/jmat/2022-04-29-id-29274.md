## Abstract:
"The object of the present paper is to initiate the study contact CR- submanifolds of a nearly trans-hyperbolic Sasakian manifold with a quarter symmetric semi metric connection. For this, some properties of CR- submanifolds of a nearly trans-hyperbolic Sasakian manifold with a quarter symmetric semi metric connection are investigated which conclude that CR- submanifolds of a nearly trans-hyperbolic Sasakian manifold with a quarter symmetric semi metric connection exists with respect to the ?????horizontal and ?????vertical."
