It is a pre-experimental study with static group comparison design. Sample consists of 40 infants, randomly assigned by purposive sampling. The sample is divided into 2 groups, intervention and control ones. Data gathering uses assessment paper to know the respondent characteristics while DAN score with structure observation was used to assess the pain intensity. The result of 20 sample of intervention group is 35% suffers mild, 60% moderate and 5% severe pain while 20 sample of control, 5% suffers moderate and the rest 95% with severe pain. Based on Mann Whitney U-test, this difference is statistically significant with p=0.000 which means there is effect of oral sucrose administration to pain intensity on infant with DPT-HB (DPT Combo) immunization.
