## Abstract:
"Oral physiology of patients will change within a few hours care in the ICU (Intensive CareUnit). Salivary pH of patients ICU may decrease. This condition can cause bacteria growing and easier to produce acid. This will speed up the process of demineralization of tooth enamel, causing dental caries, and can lead to pneumonia. Brushing teeth can increase the pH of saliva. The effect of xylitol can stimulates saliva production, alter the composition of saliva, and preventing decrease of salivary pH. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of oral hygiene toothbrushing using toothpaste that contains xylitol for the salivary pH patients in ICU. This research using quasy experimental design with nonequivalent control group design. Amount of sample is 30 people which is selected using purposive sampling technique. The methode to collecting sample of saliva is using spitting method, and then the pH of saliva was measured by pH strips. The results showed a difference of mean of salivary pH in intervention group is 1.04 and in the control group is 0.773. Statistical test results is using independent t-test and the result is p&lt;? (0,000 &lt;0,05). It can be concluded that there is effectiveness of oral hygiene tooth brushing using toothpaste that contains xylitol for salivary pH patients in general hospital Tabanan."
