Sample of this research are 30 people by purposive sampling technique, the sample was divided into 2 groups: Kegel Exercise (15 people) and Perineum Massage (15 people). This study used the Paired T-Test for the analysis of the effect of Kegel Exercise, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test for the analysis of the influence of the Perineum Massage, and Mann-Whitney U Test to determine the effect of the Kegel Exercise and Perineum Massage on pelvic floor muscle strength of the elderly. The results of this study there was Kegel Exercise effect on muscle strength (p-value = 0.000, p &lt;0.05), there was no effect of Perineum Massage on pelvic floor muscle strength of the elderly (p-value = 1.000, p&gt; 0.05), and the mean Kegel Exercise (1.1333) is higher than the Perineum Massage (0.0667).
