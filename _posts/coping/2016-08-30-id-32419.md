Emotional changes can induce violence, concentration problems, and relationship problems with others.

Asimple random sampling was used to divide the respondents into the two groups. Art therap yintervension was given over two weeks in six meetings in March 2016. The data were collected using questionnaires on January 24 and 26, 2015. The data were then analyzed using the bivariat analysis with the p value of &gt; 0.05. The hypothesis testing indicates a p-value of 0.344 in the intervention group, and a p-value of 1.000 in the control group. The pre-test analysis in both groups indicates a p-value of 1.000, and the post-test indicated a p-value of 0.285. There is an increase of 25% of the respondents who are emotionally stable in the intervention group, while 0% in the control group. There is no statistically significant influence of art therapy intervention on the emotional problems among adolescents at Public Junior High School 3, Depok Sleman, D.I.Yogyakarta.
