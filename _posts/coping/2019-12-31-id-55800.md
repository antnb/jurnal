Stroke juga akan mengakibatkan gangguan kontrol pada pergerakan, fatique, gangguan persepsi sensori nyeri, gangguan emosi, gangguan memori, dan menurunnya quality of life pada pasien tersebut. Tujuan penelitian ini untuk menganalisis efektifitas pemberian EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) terhadap quality of life pasien stroke di RSUD Tugurejo Semarang. Desain penelitian ini adalah pre experimental design dengan one group pre test and post test yang menggunakan pendekatan kuantitatif. Jumlah sampel dalam penelitian ini 62 responden dengan teknik pengambilan sampel consecutive sampling.Kriteria inklusi yaitu kesadaran composmentis, mental baik, ketergantungan sedang. Kriteria eksklusi yaitu stroke hemoragik dan kritis. Pada penelitian ini menggunakan uji wilcoxon signed rank test karena data berdistribusi tidak normal. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan terdapat perbedaan yang signifikan antara Quality of Life (QoL) Pasien Stroke Iskemik sebelum dan sesudah diberikan terapi Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) dengan nilai p value 0.001 (p value&lt;0.05). Perbedaan ditunjukkan dengan nilai mean rank yang naik dari 0.00 menjadi 29.50 dengan nilai Z hitung – 7,616 yang berarti data bervariasi tinggi secara klinik dan statistik.
