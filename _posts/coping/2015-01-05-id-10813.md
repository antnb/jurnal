Nonpharmalogical is an alternaitive treatment for hypertens, one of the most efective treatment is the combination of aloe vera juice and star fruit juice. Aloe vera and star fruit contain a nutrition called kallium and flavonoid. Kallium is very useful nutrition to hamper the renin in the angiotensin system where angiostensinogen couldn’t becoming angiostensin I form. Meanwhile flavonoid can accelerate the bloodstream and avoid the hamper of blood vassel. Aloe vera contain arginin that can make arterial wall becoming more elastic.
