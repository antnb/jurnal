"Wound care is necessary in assisting the process of wound healing. Coral bush contains chemical compounds such as flavonoids that act as anti-bacterial which disrupt the integrity of bacterial cell membranes, coral bush also contains alkaloids, saponins and tannins that help the healing process of wounds. This study aimed to determine the effect of frequency giving stalk extract coral bush in wound healing in mice. This type of research True Experiment with Post Test Only Control Group Design. Group one (stalk extract coral bush once daily), group two (stalk extract coral bush twice daily) and group three (NaCl 0.9% as control). Sampling technique with Simple Random Sampling by 27 mice. Assessment is done every day in 10 days by measuring the decrease in mice skin erythema in the analysis with Color Picker Tool program. The group one average time is 8.11 days of wound healing. Two groups is6.44 days. Three groups, namely 9.11 days. Krukal Wallis test results showed that the value Asymp. Sig was 0.000 (p &lt;0.05) so that it can be concluded that there was effect of the frequency giving stalk extract coral bush on wound healing in mice. Mann Whitney test results showed that the extract stalk coral bush twice a day is better than once a day and NaCl 0.9% in mice. Based on these results suggested the use of coral bush in wound healing."
