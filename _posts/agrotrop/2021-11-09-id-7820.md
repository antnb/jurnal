## Abstract:
"Recently, the soil organic matter was exposed decrease rapidly. The intensive soil tillage andapplication anorganic fertilizer to suppose decrease soil organic matter. How low organic matter contentof paddy soil and uppland soil not yet were taken.Soil sample of paddy soil and upland soil were taken from regency in Bali. Number of soil samplewas 96 consisted of 48 soil samples from paddy soil and 48 from uppland soil. For each regency wastaken 4 - 5 soil samples with random sampling. Soil sample was analyzed at Laboratorium TanahFakultas Pertanian Universitas Udayana. Organic matter content was analyzed with Walkley danBlack method and soil texture was analyzed with Pipet method. Organic matter content of paddy soilwere correlated with soil texture (sand, silt and clay), and of uppland soil were correlated with soiltexture (sand, silt and clay).Result of this experiment showed that, soil organic matter of paddy soil was higer than uppland soil.Soil organic matter of paddy soil with criteria very high 4.17 %, high 27.08 %, moderate 47.92 %,low 18.75 % and very low 2.08 %. Soil organic matter of uppland soil with criteria : high 6.25 %,moderate 35.42 %, low 39,58 % and very low 18.75 %. Fine texture was dominant of paddy soil, butcoarse texture was dominant at uppland soil. Correlation between soil organic matter to soil texture ofuppland soil was better than correlation between soil organic matter with soil texture at paddy soil.Correlation soil organic matter with texture (sand) at uppland soil r = -0.5142*) and correlation withclay r = 0.5007*. Correlation at paddy soil between sand and soil organic matter r = -0.1241 andbetween clay and organic matter of soils r = 0.2150."
