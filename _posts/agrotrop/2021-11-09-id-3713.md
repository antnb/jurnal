## Abstract:
"Soil Physical Properties and Plant Yield on Organic Fertilizing and Intercropping System of Corn-Peanut on Inceptisol The experiment was conducted at Pengotan Village, Bangli Regency. The purpose of this experiment was to study physical properties of soil organic fertilizer and the intercropping system of corn and peanut on Inceptisol.The experiment was arranged in nested Randomized Block Designed (RBD) with three replications. The treatments was consisted of two factors i.e. dosages of organic fertilizers (P) and cropping systems (S). The organic fertilizer treatment consisted of four levels i.e. without fertilizer (P0), 5 tons ha (P1), 10 tons ha -1 -1 (P2), and 15 tons ha (P3). The treatment of cropping system consists of three types i.e. multiplecropping corn and peanut (S1), corn monoculture (S2) and peanut monoculture (S3). The results showed that cropping systems were not significantly influenced to all parameters of soil physical properties, but significantly influenced to the yield of corn and peanuts. The NRR Test indicated that the corn was more profitable on monoculture, but yield of peanut was higher on multiplecropping. Treatment dosages of 15 tons ha -1 -1 (P3) in the peanut monoculture provide the highest fresh pod weight of 3.13 tons ha . -1"
