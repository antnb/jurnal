## Abstract:
"This paper is intended to discuss the theory of intangible asset and its roles tofirm’s value and its financial performance. The main premise to discuss is thatintangible asset, along with tangible assets, determine the firm’s value and itsperformance. If a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound? That's a classicquestion for philosophical pondering. How about this one: If an asset isintangible, does it make an impact on the corporate bottom line? Of course itdoes. But how can this impact be captured, quantified or valued in the financialanalysis? Businesses exist to create and render value to its stakeholders. Thefour aspects in value creating dimension matrix become determinants for thecompanies’ ability. The main contributor for that ability lies on the specific assetcalled intangible asset. For that reason, users of firms’ financial statementsshould have opportunities to search for firms’ information related to itsintellectual assets. Lack of objectivity, in determining the value of intangibleasset, should not be judged as the excuse not to presenting this important andrelevant information to the users."
