## Authors:
I Made Sadha Suardikha

## Abstract:
"I’m in question who I am? is the supreme consciousness that reached by humans, which is a true self that blends or single source, is something that can not be explained, but it seems there is none. So I’m in the question who I am? is something there but no, that is God. Build or develop science (= accounting)through human activity which is the abode of I, which is God, can be done through a profession or Swadharma each man himself. Profession man used as a means to build or develop science (=accounting) is related to the accounting profession."
