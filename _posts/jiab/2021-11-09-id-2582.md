## Abstract:
"Researches on the influence of financial performance on corporate valuehave been widely conducted, however results inconsistency occurred. Financialperformance, which in this case is assessed by Return on Assets (ROA), have apositive effect on corporate value, however there are also some findings that ROAhave a negative effect. Researchers predicted that there are other influencingfactors. This condition drives researchers to use corporate social responsibility(CSR) and good corporate governance (GCG) as moderating variables. Thisresearch aims to test the influence of financial performance on corporate value byconsidering the two moderating variables.This research uses 27 manufacturing firms listed on the Jakarta StockExchange during 2005 - 2006 as samples with 54 observation Hypothesis istested using moderated regression analysis to find out the interactive influence ofthe moderating variables. The corporate value measured using Tobin's Q, whiledisclosure of CSR and GCG are measured with CSR Index and managerialownerships, respectively..Results indicate that (1) ROA has a positive effect on corporate value, (2)the disclosure of CSR is able to moderate relation of ROA and corporate value,but managerial ownerships are unable to moderate the link. This is possiblebecause managerial ownerships in Indonesia is still very small and companiestend to be family-owned."
