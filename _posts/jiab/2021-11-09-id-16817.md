This research is important because the numberof fraud cases handled by Bapepam be evidence that there is a failure to detect fraud audit financial statements. The scarcity of research in Indonesia which predict fraud in the financial statements using the personal analysis of financial need and auditor switching to undertake testing of these variables. The sample of this research is manufacturing companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2011-2013 with amount is 116 companies. Hypothesis testing is performed with logisticregression. The results of this study are personal financial need as measured by ownership of people in a positive effect on fraudulent financial statements. This means that the higher the percentage of ownership by people in the practice of fraud in manipulating financial statements increased. Auditor switching is not influential in predicting fraudulent financial statements. That is changing whether or not the firm conducting the audit, it is possible to detect fraud in the financial statements depending on skepticism auditors conduct audits."
