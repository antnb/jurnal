## Abstract:
"The absence of standard in English learning in Institut Teknologi Kesehatan (ITEKES) Bali as well as the general English that is contained in the learning materials were becoming the reasons why this study was conducted. It aims to (1) analyze the needs for English language teaching materials for midwifery students of ITEKES Bali, (2) describe courses in the midwifery curriculum of ITEKES Bali, and (3) develop an EOP based English learning material for midwifery students of ITEKES Bali. This study was designed a research and development consisting of 3 stages, namely (1) needs analysis which used questionnaires to gain the data, (2) development of prototypes and trials, and (3) expert validation. The questionnaires were distributed to 30 midwifery students and 10 midwives to know how English is used in the work field. Then the result of this study is an EOP based learning material covering several topics such as greeting, showing room, arranging schedule, explaining labor process, postpartum, children development and care, reproduction system, and human body. The material is presented in a web and it can be used as an alternative source of English learning based on the results of expert validation."
