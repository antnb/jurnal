## Abstract:
"Background: Pancreatic pseudocysts are often managed through surgical drainage, which is common in rural areas for several reasons, including limited facilities. Case: Therefore, this study presents a successful treatment of three pancreatic pseudocyst cases using surgical drainage cystogastrostomy. Furthermore, this treatment method was selected due to the ease of performance in rural hospitals and was successfully performed without any complications. Conclusion: The diagnoses of pancreatic pseudocysts were confirmed by anamnesis, physical examination, and CT-scan imaging. The operations were also performed successfully without any complications. However, the patients will also undergo follow-up for two years to enable the doctors to observe for any possible long-term complications."
