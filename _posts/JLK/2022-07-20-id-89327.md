## Abstract:
"Almost every region in the nusantara has its own regional script, one of which is in Bali the people know the Balinese script as a script commonly used by their ancestors in writing. In order to keep this Balinese script sustainable and not extinct, learning about this script is applied in schools in Balinese language subjects. In addition to applying learning about script in schools, it would be better if learning about Balinese script could be done in more interesting ways and concepts. One of them is by making an educational game for the introduction of Balinese characters. Which in this application the user will provide input in the form of Balinese script characters written on the application, which then the input will go through a preprocessing process then proceed with diagonal feature extraction, then the results of the feature extraction will go through a classification process using the Learning Vector Quantization method. . The result is a web-based application that can recognize Balinese script writing using the Learning Vector Quantization classification method with an accuracy rate of 58.6% and get a good response from each respondent who has tested the application."
