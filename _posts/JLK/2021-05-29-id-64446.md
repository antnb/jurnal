## Abstract:
"The world is being hit by a pandemic due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak. The changes brought by this virus are huge, one of which is school activities that are transformed into online learning. Online learning causes students to not do their own classroom learning. This causes students to become un familiar with their school properly, such as the layout of classrooms and school facilities. By using Augmented Reality the problem can be solved. Augmented Reality (AR) is the merging of real and virtual objects in a real environment with interactive results and presented in real time. AR can be used to modeling the entire shape of the school, making it easier for users to get information about the building from the school instead of walking manually. Users only need to install the app on their smarthphone and scan the specified QR code in order to be able to bring up the building object along with the information. The result of this research is an AR application which can provide information about the rooms and buildings at SDN 1 Padangsambian."
