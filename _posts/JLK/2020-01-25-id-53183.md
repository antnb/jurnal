## Abstract:
"Fast food is a product that we often encounter in stores such as convenience stores. Ready-to-eat products can now be easily found by consumers. One of the reason is due to the expansion of minimarkets in areas that are easily reached, such as housing complexes, school areas, and offices. Sentiment analysis is used to determine whether an opinion or comment on a product has a positive or negative interest and can be used as a reference in improving service, or improving product quality. In this research, we study the sentiments of consumers towards snack food products as a reference to improve the level of service and quality of these products.. We classify the sentiment of a review on snack food products as positive and negative. To classify the sentiments we apply the Naïve Bayes and Multinomial Naïve Bayes methods. We compare the two methods to study the most effective and efficient method for classifying sentiments on reviews of snack food products. Keywords: Sentiment Analysis, TF-IDF, Naïve Bayes,Multinomial, Review, Snack, Preprocessing"
