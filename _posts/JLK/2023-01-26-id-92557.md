The test results by testing each feature of the Potme Farm website using Maze Design obtained an overall result of 95% The value was obtained based on the average values that have been described from the key performance indicator including user success, average scenario processing time, and click errors by users. Based on the results of stages ranging from design, development, as well as testing and development of the Potme Farm website design with the Design Thinking method, it can produce a User Interface (UI) design that suits user needs (User Experience)."
