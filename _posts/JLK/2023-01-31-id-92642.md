The number of vitamin suplements product available with various types and criteria requires consuments to be more careful when choosing the right vitamin suplements for their body.

The development of ontology models in this research use an app called Protégé 5.5.0. and in the evaluation process, ontology gives great result on answering the questions that given by users."
