## Abstract:
"Ulap-ulap is one of the symbols used to indicate that a building has been carried out Mlaspas ceremony. Mlaspas is one of the ceremonies performed to purify and clean a building. Ulap-ulap itself consists of various types depending on the building where it is placed, for example the ulap-ulap placed on the Pelinggih building will be different from the ulap-ulap placed on the Bale building. So that the pattern contained in each type of Ulap-ulap is different. The purpose of this research is to be able to do pattern recognition on Ulap-ulap images. The method used in this study is Backpropagation, and for its implementation, the MATLAB 7.5.0 (R2007b) application is used. This study used 18 images of Ulap-ulap, including 15 training data and 6 test data. The stages of the process carried out are for Ulap-ulap pattern recognition, the first is data collection, then image processing, and finally the pattern recognition. Recognition of the Ulap-ulap image pattern with Backpropagation, resulted in an accuracy of 83.333%."
