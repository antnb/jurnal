## Abstract:
"Smartphones are already a must-have communication technology to make it easier to live your daily life. However, with so many choices can make consumers confused in determining the appropriate choice. The Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method can help in the simple process that can be applied to decision-making cases such as in smartphone selection recommendations with a wide range of attributes. In the case of this study, the results were obtained that the Realme X3 Superzoom smartphone scored the highest preference with a value of 22. With this research, it is hoped that this decision support system can help potential consumers to more easily consider in the selection of smartphones that suit their wishes or needs"
