## Abstract:
"Everyone has a different kind of voice. Based on gender, voice type is divided into six parts, namely soprano, mezzo soprano, and alto for women; and tenor, baritone, and bass in men. Each type of sound has a different range and with different frequencies. This study classified the type of voice in women using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method by recording the voices of each user which would then be processed using the FFT method to obtain the appropriate sound range. This research got results with an accuracy of up to 80%.The results obtained from this study are quite appropriate and it is proven that the FFT method can be used in digital signal processing."
