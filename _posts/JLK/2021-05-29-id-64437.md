## Abstract:
"One of the things that affects classification results is the correlation of features to the class of a data. This research was conducted to determine the effect of the reduction of features (independent variable) that have the weakest correlation or have a distant relationship with the class (dependent variable). Bivariate Pearson Correlation is used as a feature selection method and K-Nearest Neighbor is used as a classification method. Results of the test showing that, 75.1% average accuracy was obtained for classification without feature selection, while using feature selection, average accuracy was obtained in the range of 75% - 79.3%. The average accuracy obtained by the selection of features tends to be higher compared to the accuracy obtained without selection of features."
