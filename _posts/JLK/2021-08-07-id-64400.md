## Abstract:
"Many Indonesian people, especially in Bali, make pigs as livestock. Pig livestock are susceptible to various types of diseases and there have been many cases of pig deaths due to diseases that cause losses to breeders. Therefore, the author wants to create an Android-based application that can predict the type of disease in pigs by applying the C4.5 Algorithm. The C4.5 algorithm is an algorithm for classifying data in order to obtain a rule that is used to predict something. In this study, 50 training data sets were used with 8 types of diseases in pigs and 31 symptoms of disease. which is then inputted into the system so that the data is processed so that the system in the form of an Android application can predict the type of disease in pigs. In the testing process, it was carried out by testing 15 test data sets and producing an accuracy value that is 86.7%. In testing the application features built using the Kotlin programming language and the SQLite database, it has been running as expected."
