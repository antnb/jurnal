## Abstract:
"The knapsack problem is problem that is still often found in everyday life, one of which is the problem of selecting goods to be transported into containers for delivery of goods. This knapsack problem can be solved by using various optimization algorithms, one of which is the genetic algorithm. This study aims to design a genetic algorithm model to solve the 2-dimensional knapsack problem. 2-dimensional knapsack problem is a knapsack problem that has 2 constraints and in this study, the constraints used were weight and volume.. The evaluation results of the genetic algorithm will be compared with dynamic programming. From the evaluation results that have been carried out, it can be concluded that genetic algorithms can produce near-optimal results with faster computational times than dynamic programming."
