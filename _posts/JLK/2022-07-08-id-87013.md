## Abstract:
"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can have serious impacts on your organization and can cause enormous losses. This attack works by sending a computer or server an amount of requests that exceeds the capabilities of that computer. When classifying DDoS attacks in this study, feature selection is performed using correlation-based feature selection (CFS). The dataset used by the author in this study is CSE-CIC-IDS 2018. Feature selection on a dataset using CFS gets the results in the form of features related to the dataset. That is, a total of 31 features with a relationship score greater than 0.1. The average precision generated by the system using the random forest method and CFS function selection is 99.784%. Accuracy is the result of using the number of trees parameter with a value of 10. For a random forest model with no feature selection, the highest accuracy is 49.501%. This indicates that changing the random forest model parameters and selecting the CFS feature will affect high accuracy."
