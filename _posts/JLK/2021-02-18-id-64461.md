## Abstract:
"In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Named Recognition Entity (NER) is a sub-discussion widely used for research. The NER’s main task is to help identify and detect the entity-named in the sentence, such as personal names, locations, organizations, and many other entities. In this paper, we present a Location NER system for Balinese texts using a rule-based approach. NER in the Balinese document is an essential and challenging task because there is no research on this. The rule-based approach using human-made rules to extract entity name is one of the most famous ways to extract entity names as well as machine learning. The system aims to identify proper names in the corpus and classify them into locations class. Precision, recall, and F-measure used for the evaluation. Our results show that our proposed model is trustworthy enough, having average recall, precision, and f-measure values for the specific location entity, respectively, 0.935, 0.936, and 0.92. These results prove that our system is capable of recognizing named-entities of Balinese texts."
