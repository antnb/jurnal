## Abstract:
"Tourism is the mainstay of the economy of the region of Bali and is an important sector in supporting the level of community welfare. The world of tourism is essentially an important symbol for Bali. Of the many tourists who come to Bali, of course not all tourists know all information about Bali, such as in terms of tourist locations, and tourist attractions closest to other tourist attractions. Therefore, the authors aim to create a recommendation system that can provide planning for the selection of tourist attractions according to the closest distance and the user's budget. This system is designed using the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity To Ideal Solution) method and the Greedy Algorithm. The TOPSIS method is a SPK (Decision Making System) that will be used for the selection of tourist attractions that will help tourists to arrange vacation planning before going on a tour. While the Greedy Algorithm is used to find the closest or shortest distance between a tourist site and other tourist attractions, this algorithm will be able to determine which path will be taken first or called the local optimal path, so that all the paths are taken at the end of the trip and create a travel route shortest or called the global optimum so that it can also be the expected solution. From this it can be determined the value of the shortest travel route that starts from the location of the user's residence to the tourist attractions and to other nearby tourist attractions. The data used is data obtained from DISPARDA, namely tourist data. Research related to the selection of tourism object decisions based on the type of tourism, prices and facilities, and the results are able to provide recommendations for tourist attractions that meet these criteria.
