## Abstract:
"Geguntangan is pesantian in religious ceremonies in Bali accompanied by gamelan music. The human sense of hearing tends to have limitations, which causes not all vocals mixed with gamelan to be heard clearly. Therefore we need a system that can be used to separate vocals with gamelan in the geguntangan. Separation of sound sources is categorized as Blind Source Separation (BSS) or also called Blind Signal Separation, which means an unknown source. The algorithm used to handle BSS is the Fast Independent Component Analysis (FastICA) algorithm with a focus on separating the sound signal in a wav-format sound file. FastICA algorithm is used for the sound separation process with the value parameter used is Mean Square Error (MSE). From the simulation results show the results of MSE calculations using the mixing matrix [0.3816, 0.8678], [0.8534, -0.5853] obtained the results for the FastICA method, the MSE value is 3.60 x 10-5 for the vocal and 1.71 x 10-6 for the instrument."
