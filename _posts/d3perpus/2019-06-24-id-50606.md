## Abstract:
"ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to determine the role of librarians in increasing reading interest in blind students in SLB 1 Denpasar state. This research is a qualitative descriptive study. Data collection is done by participatory observation. Data collection techniques are carried out by interview, documentation and observation. The resource person of this study was a librarian, a blind teaching teacher and a blind student at the SLB 1Denpasar Public. The results of the study show the role of librarians in increasing reading interest in blind students is quite good. Although the school library did not employ librarians but only a library officer. The efforts of library staff to increase reading interest in blind students, namely to provide learning resources for Tuannetra students, provide a place to make it easier for students to get used to reading Braille books, and establish interaction and active communication with students. Keywords: Librarians, Reading Interest, Blind"
