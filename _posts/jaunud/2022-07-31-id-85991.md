## Abstract:

In the application related to the design of the Al-Qur'an museum with the Regionalism Architecture approach, it begins by using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods in the flow of data collection as input which is then processed through systematic stages into project specifications as output. Therefore, the design of the Al-Qur'an Museum with a regionalist architectural approach will make it easier for the public to learn about the history of Islam about the Qur'an. The architectural approach of regionalism is regionalism as a cultural system, regionalism as a soul in a place and regionalism as an identity and regionalism as a critical attitude. The geometric shape of the building, which is a rectangle, is then put together according to the needs and zoning of the space and the materials used and the appearance of the building which will affect the identity and function of the building. Keywords: perancangan, museum, regionalism architecture, Qur’an"
