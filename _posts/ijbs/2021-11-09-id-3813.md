"Has conducted research on the use of steroids triamsinolon asetonid as pseudo-othematomamedical therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness triamsinolonasetonid. Prevention of the formation of serum in the lesion, so that pseudo-othematomacan be cured without surgery.

Then press verban installed. In thecontrol group, only pressing verban installed. From the research results obtained, whishafter the third treatment using the triamsinolon asetonid, pseudo-othematoma diseaselooked very meaningful.
