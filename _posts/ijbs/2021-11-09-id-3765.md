Redesign of place and worksystem with ergonomic intervention contribute to : (a) the decrease in work loadfrom medium category into light category; (b) the decrease in work tiredness frombeing very tired category into being not tired; (c) the decrease in musculoskeletalcomplaint from high category (being disturbed) into light category (beingundisturbed); (d) the decrease in medical treatment cost by 56,97%; (e) the increasein work productivity by 41,47%; (f) the increase in the SKT rollers’ salaries by15,10%; and (g) the increase in the company’s profit by 12,76%.
