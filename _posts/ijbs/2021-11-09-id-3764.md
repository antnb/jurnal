## Abstract:
"Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the protozoa Toxoplasma gondii.Primary infection in pregnant women can cause abortion, neonatal death or abnormalityof fetus. Accurate diagnosis is needed to prevent infection especially related to thepresence of cyst in the tissuesThe aim of this research was to study sensitivity and specificity of ELISAmethod with 30 kDa protein antigen to detect T.gondii infection in pig with micebioassay as gold standard.. Samples were 171 pigs slaughtered at pig slaughter house inDarmasaba BadungThe result showed that sensitivity of ELISA method was 100% and 90,7% inspecificity.Research about sensitivity using ELISA test to predict cysts presence in tissuewere needed in the future."
