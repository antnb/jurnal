The used of plough for landpreparation for long time ago the deep of rice field soil is constant because the ploughblade can be adjusted up and down. The plough can be turn to the right or left side so thatall part of rice field except the corner can be cultivate. But for pulling the plough must bedifficult to find two cows. While if using tractor or cultivator the right or left side and thecorner of the rice field can’t be cultivate. Deep of rice filed soil become shallow so thefertility of soil reduced.
