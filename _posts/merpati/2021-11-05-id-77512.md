Before the SPBE there was a different term, which was E-Government. E-Government is one of the information technologies used by the government to provide services and information to public, people in business, as well as other matters related to government affairs. This study aims to determine the development of the implementation of E-Government in Indonesia, the concept of E-Government in Indonesia and the comparison of Indonesian E-Government with other countries.
