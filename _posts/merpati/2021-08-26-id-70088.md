## Abstract:
"Bali is one of the provinces with profitable tourism opportunities. It has led to many businesses related to tourism, which is a travel agent. Travel agents in Bali usually offer variety of tour packages with different prices and specifications. The problem experienced by tourists in determining tour packages is that the price of tour packages is quite high and does not match the tourist budget. In addition, the schedule of visits from tour packages is also inflexible. This problem can be overcome by making a decision support system for forming tour packages. This study uses the BWM method to determine each criterion’s optimal weight and the MARCOS to rank alternative tourism objects that will form a tour package. Testing results using confusion matrix get an accuracy value of 74.19%, precision of 81.25%, recall / sensitivity of 72.22% and specificity of 76.92%."
