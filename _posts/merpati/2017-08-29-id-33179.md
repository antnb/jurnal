## Abstract:
"The online business era causes the form of transactions to occur so quickly that the information stored in the data warehouse becomes invalid. Companies are required to have a strong system, which is a system that is real time in order to be able to perform data loading into the media repository that resides on different hosts in the near-real time. Data Warehouse is used as a media repository of data that has the nature of subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and is fixed. Data Warehouse can be built into real time management with the advantages possessed and utilize Change Data Capture. Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique that can be used as problem solution to build real time data warehousing (RTDW). The binary log approach in change data capture is made to record any data manipulation activity that occurs at the OLTP level and is managed back before being stored into the Data Warehouse (loading process). This can improve the quality of data management so that the creation of the right information, because the information available is always updated. Testing shows that Binary Log approach in Change Data Capture (BinlogCDC) is able to generate real time data management, valid current information, dynamic communication between systems, and data management without losing any information from data manipulation."
