Performance improvement indicators used were decreased complaints of boredom, fatigue and musculoskeletal.Methods used in this study was experimental study with “treatment by subject design”. The study used as many as 18 sample given two treatment which was the first period without the ergonomic intervention involving stretching of the muscle and drinking sweetened tea and the second period was a group with ergonomic intervention. Boredom was measured by a boredom questionnaire.Fatigue, was measured from 30 items of fatigue questionnaire from Japan IFRC(Industrial Fatigue Research Committee). Skeletal muscle complaints was predicted from Nordic Body Map questionnaire. Data were analyzed bynormality test and t-paired test with significancy level of 5%.The results of this study showed that there was a significant difference(p&lt;0,05) in average score boredom, fatigue and musculoskeletal complaints. The mean boredom score in the first period was 39,724 and in the second period was26,415 with reduction in average boredom score was 33.5 %. Fatigue mean scorein the first period was 44,050 and the second period was 23,525 with reductionof fatigue score was 46,59 %. Mean musculoskeletal complaints score in the first period was 39,25 and the second period was 14,02 with reduction in mean musculoskeletal complaints score was 64,28 %. 19It can be concluded from this study that ergonomic intervention by muscle stretching and drinking sweetened tea in the interrupted time of examination process improved the performance of OSCE examiner in terms of boredom, fatigue and musculosceletal complaints in the Faculty of Medicine of Islamic University Al-Azhar Mataram."
