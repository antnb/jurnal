Period II (P1) the process of injection cleaning with work station improvement and giving stretching intervention. Work boredom, musculoskeletal complaint and work productivity the data between Period I and Period II. Analyzed with Paired Samples Test for differences of meaning between groups variable boredom of work, musculoskeletal disorders, working productivity to level of meaning ?=0,05. The result of research showed that workstation improvement and giving stretching can reduce the boredom of work Period I 118.40±4.42; Period II 108.50±4.78; decrease of 8.4%. Reduce musculoskeletal complaint Period I before work 41.90±4.72 and after work 71.70±8.42; Period II before work 37.20±3.29 and after work 56.20±4.47; decrease of 21.61%. Increase productivity Period I 0.13±0.04 and Period II 0.19±0.06; increase of 46.15%. There was a decrease in boredom, musculoskeletal complaint, and increase productivity with significan level (p&lt;0.05). The conclusion that the workstation improvement and giving stretching can reduce boredom, musculoskeletal complaint and increase work productivity of employees injection cleaning at silver industry CV JPS.
