"The production process of making gamelan in the village Tihingan, Klungkung, Bali, still using the traditional fireplace with open flames both to the melting process as well as on the process of formation so that crafters fairly heavy workload caused by exposure to radiation heat and dust. This research was conducted observational against 5 people workers (craftsman) gamelan nguwad process. The workload is measured by pulse craftsman work. Microclimate in the workplace were measured wet temperature, dry temperature, humidity, intensity of noise, and light intensity. Musculoskeletal disorderpredicted by questioner of Nordic Body Map and general fatigue predicted by the questioner 30 items exhaustion with four Likert scale. The results of the research to get the pulse of gamelan craftsmen working on a furnace repairman 116.25 ± 3.78, the flop workers 115.42 ± 2.47, and 3.29 ± 126.47 of nguwad workers.
