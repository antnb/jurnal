The patriarchal culture is very strong in determining strategic positions in GKPB resulting in male domination in leadership structures and policies that tend to be gender biased. With qualitative methods and using the Theory of Power-Knowledge Relationships Michel Foucault, According to Foucault, knowledge and power have a reciprocal relationship. Continuous violation of power will create a form of knowledge, and vice versa, the administration of knowledge will have an effect on power. The second is Pierre Bourdieu's Structural theory, which describes how symbolic violence and the division of roles in society shape habitus. Keywords: Representation, Patriarchy, Symbolic Violence"
