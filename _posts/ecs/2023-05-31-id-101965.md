The identity, both in terms of the language and culture of the community. In addition, there is a cultural shift that was originally intact to be adapted to the surrounding conditions due to the influence of resources. Second, the ideological and political factors adopted. In this factor every community has a different ideology even though it comes from the same area. Likewise with the politics adopted, every society has different political choices according to the ideology they believe in and a feeling of panic towards one political party or vice versa.
