However, an imbalance has occurred as far as Hindu Religion education isconcerned, that is, the students at particular educational institutions are not provided withHindu Religion education as intended by the Act.In Article 30 of the Act of Number 20 year 2003 concerning national educationsystem, on the other hand, it is stated that: any religious education can be carried out by thegovernment and or a community’s group belonging to a particular religion in accordancewith the applicable regulations. It is also stated that religious education is functioned toprepare the students to be able to comprehend and apply their religious teaching values and orto be experts in religions. In addition, it is also stated that religious education can be formallyand informally conducted in the forms of diniyah, pesantren, pesraman, phabaja, smnera,and the like.How Hindu Religion educa tion is implemented at Elementary School Number 17Dauh Puri and Dwijendra Elementary School Depasar cannot be separated from theinfrastructure, facilities, curri culum and teachers available, and the government’s policy.Therefore, this study is focused on 1) the existence of the components needed forimplementing Hindu Religion education, 2) the factors influencing the implementation ofHindu religion education, and 3) the meaningfulness and attempts done to implement HinduReligion education if related to the inventory of Balinese culture.This study is conducted to explain, describe, criticize, and analyze theimplementation of Hindu Religion education at Elementary School Number 17 Dauh Puri andDwijendra Elementary School Denpasar.
