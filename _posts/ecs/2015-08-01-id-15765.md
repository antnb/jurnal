(2) What ideologies contributing to the power relation in the management of the resort? (3) What was the meaning of the power relation among the three stakeholders such as the government, the investors and the local people, in such a management? It was found that the power relation in the management of the Nusa Dua Tourist Resort was affected by the hegemonic power, the negotiation power, and the oppositional power. The ideologies which contributed to the power relation in the management of the resort included the ideology of global tourism, the ideology of green tourism in the management of the resort and the ideology of the Local Culture in Culture Tourism. The struggle for the meaning of the power relation in the management of the resort among the three pillars (the government/BTDC, the investors, and the local people) would take place continuously. The three pillars gave different meanings, depending on their respective positions and interests."
