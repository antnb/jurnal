## Abstract:
"Simulation Module Testing Solar Cell Charger For Supplies the Warning LightSimulation module has been tested solar cell charger to supply the battery warning light on two different,where the purpose of the author can test solar cell circuit simulation for supply warning light, to save /power supply / energy resources considering the energy resources in our country on the wane, thegovernment is planning to wear solar energy. Thus the authors tried to make a series of simulation testing ofthe solar cell to supply warning light And there was its function is to determine its capacity tool / chargermodule simulation of solar cells and battery / batteries are different still feasible or optimal used to supplywarning light. The lamp warning light works on voltage DC (Direct Current) which absorbed sunlight thesolar cell module is converted into DC voltage. Module testing solar cells as an energy source electricitywere, for the storage of electrical energy in the battery as a source of energy that will turn on the lights forwarning light for 24 hours. Simulation modules use solar cells to DC LED warning light using veryprecisely applied is by using solar power, so we can save on electricity costs due to the LED DC can notdole directly from PLN net. In this paper the authors perform Simulation Testing of Solar Cell ChargerModule to supply warning light and analysis for the selection of solar cell capacity, and the capacity of thebattery / batteries are different."
