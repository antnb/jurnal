## Abstract:
"The sintering temperature is played a vital role in the evolution of phase structure, microstructure, and the properties of the superconductor. In this study, the Gd0.9La0.1Ba1.95Sr0.05Cu3O7-d phase compound has been synthesized by the wet method using HNO3 as a solvent. The samples were divided into two groups. The first sample was calcined at 400 °C for 2 hours + 500 °C for 2 hours + 600 °C for 6 hours. The second sample treated by the same process and then continued by heating at 900 °C for 15 minutes. The effect of the calcination temperature for the synthesis of Gd0.9La0.1Ba1.95Sr0.05Cu3O7-d bulks was investigated using the DTA-TG method. The results showed that the optimum reaction temperature for the formation of Gd0.9La0.1Ba1.95Sr0.05Cu3O7-d phase was 938 °C. The additional heating temperature e.g. 900 °C for 15 minutes on the calcination process can reduce the optimum formation temperature of Gd0.9La0.1Ba1.95Sr0.05Cu3O7-d compounds by 20 °C. The peritectic melting reaction temperatures of the sample without the addition of heating and with the addition of heating at temperature 900 °C for 15 minutes are 1032°C and 1035°C, respectively. The melting temperatures of both samples are 1164 °C and 1200 °C."
