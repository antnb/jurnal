## Abstract:
"An investigation of the effects of UV exposure particularly UV-C to the characteristics of the currentvoltage(I-V) of chitosan membrane 2% has been done. The electrolyte solution was NaCl withvarious concentration of 0.1 mM and 10 mM, time exposure 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes, and theincreasing currents from 19 -24 ?A with increment of 0.5 ?A. Transport process is done by using amodel cell membrane consist of 2 chambers. The voltage difference of membrane is measured using acalomel electrode. In this study, chitosan membranes were exposure to UV radiation for 0-60 minutes.The I-V characterization is done by the current clamp method. The solution used is NaCl solution withthe concentration ratio of the both chambers (C1:C2) was 0.1 mM : 0.1 mM and the given currentswere from 19 -24 ?A with increment of 0.5 ?A. From the observations obtained, the I-V characteristicgraphs showed Ohmic's region, it has not showed limiting current density and overlimiting currentregion. The I-V characteristic graphs also shows that ion transport in NaCl solution (voltage can bemeasured) in the chitosan membrane system occurred at a certain current value. The increased oftime exposures resulted in a decrease of conductance of chitosan membrane to ions in NaCl solution."
