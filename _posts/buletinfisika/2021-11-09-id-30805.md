## Abstract:
"Bali is a potential area prone to lightning strikes because it has a tropical climate with thepossibility of rain accompanied by lightning quite high and also vulnerable because of thepopulation density is very high. These conditions threaten the safety of lives and property of thepopulation, so it is necessary to study the vulnerability of lightning strikes in Bali. For identify thelevel of vulnerability to lightning strikes used two factors, the threat factors using CG(Cloud toGround) lightning incidence data (2009-2013) and vulnerability factors using data of populationdensity and land use for homes and buildings. Two factors were analyzed using the method of SAW(Simple Additive Weighting) to obtain level of vulnerability to lightning strikes each district. Theresults of the calculations show Selemadeg Barat, Denpasar, Kuta, Pupuan, Klungkung andSelemadeg have a high level of vulnerability to lightning strikes, 27 districts are in the middlecategory and the remaining 21 districts are in the low category."
