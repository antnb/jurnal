## Abstract:
"Has conducted research Cobalt-60 radionuclide uptake by plants kiapu (Pistia stratiotes L.) found in many waters. The purpose of the study was to determine the value of the transfer factor on plant kiapu to Cobalt-60 in water. The study was conducted by growing plants on media kiapu gutter water in pots with the height 35 cm and diameter 11,5 cm containing Cobalt-60. The amount of Cobalt - 60 is absorbed and accumulated by the plant parts, i.e. roots and leaves, was observed by measuring the activity of Cobalt - 60 in the parts of the plant using a gamma spectrometer. Value of the transfer factor is determined by comparing the concentration of Cobalt-60 plants accumulated against its concentration in water. From this research, the highest transfer factor values obtained approximately 8000 ml/g in the roots. The value of the transfer factor of more than 1 ml/gr indicates that kiapu is a plant that has the ability to accumulate radionuclides Cobalt-60.Keywords : absorption, Cobalt-60, kiapu, transfer factor"
