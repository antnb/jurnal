## Abstract:
"Innovation baby biscuits from composite flour using local raw material such as yellow sweet potatoes,green bean and millet is important to diversification. This research aims to determine the proteincontent, ?-carotene and sensory properties of Baby Biscuits from 9 types composite flour formulas. Theexperimental design was a complete randomized design with a 9 composite flour formulas and repeated2 times, the proportion of yellow sweet potatoes flour : green bean sprouts flour : fermented millet flournamely 60:25:15; 55:30:15; 50:35:15; 55:25:20; 50:30:20; 45:35:20; 50:25:25; 45:30:25; 40:35:25.The results of the analysis stated that the comparison of the composition of composite flour has asignificant effect on the value of protein, ?-karoten, sensory test of taste and crispness of baby biscuits.The best formulation was obtained in baby biscuits made with the propotion of yellow sweet potatoesflour : green bean sprouts flour : fermented millet flour of 50:35:15. Those baby biscuits contained8.51% protein, 398.18 g/100g ?-carotene, taste is like (5.93) and crispness level is crispy (4.20)."
