This study aimed to analyze the content of vitamin C in loloh cemcem with stevia leaves by UV-Vis Spectrophotometry Method. This study was a randomized complete design 1 factorial with 5 treatments of stevia leaves concentration and repeated 3 times. The results of the study on samples with stevia concentration of 5%, 7%, 9%, 11% and 13%, were 2.26%, 2.16%, 2.11%, 1.85% and 1.76% of vitamin C, respectively.
