## Abstract:
"This research aimed to get the etanol’s consentration and ratio avocado leaf to solvents on highestflavonoid content and antioxidant activity of avocado leaf extract and also get stability of pH andtemperature for flavonoid extract avocado leaf. This research did into two step. First step was effect ofetanol’s consentration and ratio avocado leaf to solvents. The experimental design used in this researchwas a completely randomized design with replication, which consisted of two factors. The first factorwas etanol’s concentration (90 and 96%). The second factor was ratio avocado leaf to solvents (1:6,1:8, 1:10). Data were analyzed with analysis of variance, followed by Duncan test. The best treatmenton first step would use into second step of this reseach. Second step was effect of flavonoid content’sstability of extract avocado leaf to pH and temperature. The experimental design used in this researchwas a completely randomized design with replication, which consisted of two factors. The first factorwas pH (4, 6 and 8). The second factor was temperature (70, 80 and 90OC). Data were analyzed withanalysis of variance, followed by Duncan test. The results showed that the best treatment in first stepwas etanol 90% and ratio avocado leaf to solvent 1:6 which the highest resulted rendemen, total fenol,total flavonoid and antioxidant activity were 17.54%, 79.19 mg/g extrak, 69.19 mg/g extrak and72.91%. The results showed that the best treatment second step was pH 4 and temperature 70OC whichthe best resulted total fenol, total flavonoid and antioxidant activity that stablest. Persentase that stillstay at extract were 94.9%, 86.99% dan 85.08%."
