## Abstract:
This study aims to analyze and compare the performance of three frequency load controller methods in a hybrid generator consisting of three types of energy generation, namely microhydro, diesel and wind. The controller methods being compared are the PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) method, ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System), and Fuzzy. This analysis was carried out to improve the efficiency and stability of the hybrid generating system by optimizing the frequency load controller. Frequency instability can occur due to load fluctuations, changes in environmental conditions, or system disturbances. Therefore, the use of an effective and adaptive controller method is very important in maintaining the stability and reliability of the hybrid generator system. The analytical method used in this study involved data collection and computer modeling. The required data includes information on load variations, energy production, and environmental conditions. Furthermore, the PID, ANFIS, and Fuzzy methods are applied to the data to build a frequency load controller model. The results of the analysis show that the three controller methods have different performance in maintaining frequency stability in the hybrid generator system. The PID method provides a fast and accurate response to load fluctuations, but is less adaptive to environmental changes. While the ANFIS method is able to adapt well to changes in system conditions, it requires time for model training. Fuzzy methods can provide control that is more adaptive and tolerant to disturbances, but may require more complex tuning. However, in general, the use of intelligent controller methods such as ANFIS and Fuzzy can improve the performance of hybrid generators by producing more adaptive and stable controls. This research has important implications for the development of more efficient and reliable hybrid power systems. By choosing the right controller method, hybrid power plants can provide energy in a more stable and environmentally friendly manner, and reduce dependence on limited fossil resources. Therefore, this research can make a significant contribution to the development of renewable energy and sustainable development in the future.
