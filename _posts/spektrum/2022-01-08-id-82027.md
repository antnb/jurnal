## Abstract:
The cleanliness of the solar panels is one of the factors that affect the energyproduction of a solar power plant. Solar panel cleaning is a solution to keep solar panels cleanso that energy production can be optimal. This article reviews research developments andcommercial products for solar panel cleaning, with the result showing various applicabletechniques and commercial products for solar panel cleaning purposes. There are two distincttechniques used in solar panel cleaning, manual and automatic. The manual cleaning method isa method that conducts any action to operate the system manually by humans. The automaticcleaning method is a method that is controlled directly by the system without the need forhuman interference. Commercial solar panel cleaning products include telescopic polesequipped with brushes and water pumps, a robot that is permanently attached to the solar panelsupport construction equipped with dry clean and water clean methods, a robot with portablesystems using long roller brushes, a convenient robot which has a remote vacuum cleanersystem, to a mobile cleaning system using a robotic arm.
