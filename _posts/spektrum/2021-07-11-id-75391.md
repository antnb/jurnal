## Abstract:
Due increases develop the electric power system, the more effective security system is needed.One of the security systems is the earthing system at Hotel X Jimbaran. After takes measurement theaverage measurement results of 1.14 ? ~ 2.47 ? at four different location points that cause the flow ofovercurrent or overvoltage to electrical equipment. This study purpose to improve the existing earthingsystem to achieve earthing resistance L conditions, TwoEarthing Electrode Earthing System with S<L conditions, Plate Earthing System and Grid-Rod EarthingSystem.The calculation analysis results design of the earthing system with earthing resistance <1? each fault location obtained different results. Building 1000 reccomended to choose plate earthing system inwetsoil conditions with the result of earthing resistance 0,9594?; Building 2000 reccomended to choose gridrod earthing system in dry soil conditions with the result of earthing resistance 0,84?; Building 3000reccomended to choose grid-rod earthing system in dry soil conditions with the result of earthingresistance 0,976?; and Ballroom reccomended to choose grid-rod earthing system in wet soil conditionswith the resultof earthing resistance 0,865?. Each location according to the analyzed earthing systemrecommendations, the most economical prices were calculated below IDR 10,000,000,- (Ten MillionIndonesia Rupiah Currency), at Building 1000 with a total cost of IDR.4.034.000,-; Building 2000 with atotal cost of IDR.6.698.650,-; Building 3000 with a total cost of IDR.7.448.200,-; and Ballroom with a totalcost of IDR.7.352.200,-.
