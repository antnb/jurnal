## Abstract:
Wireless network is one of the most important things in the development of telecommunication. However, the existing wireless technology has not been able to efficiently create a very high data rate because it was very sensitive to fading. Therefore, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technology combined with MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) transceiver system was used to gain more diversity and bandwidth efficiency. The propagation performed on the OFDM MIMO system was multipath propagation. To reduce Intersymbol Interference (ISI) was used Zero Forcing (ZF) equalizer which works by combining channel response and equalizer response itself to eliminate ISI. This study aims to determine the effect of Zero Forcing Equalizer on OFDM MIMO system using rayleigh fading channel and compared the result with OFDM MIMO STBC system. The research method used was simulation using MatLab R2015a. The simulation results showed that the performance of OFDM MIMO ZF system was worse than OFDM MIMO STBC system i.e BER vs EbNo simulation, eye diagram simulation, and constellation diagram simulation. The OFDM MIMO ZF system was required an Eb / No value more than 25 dB to achieve BER 10-4 while the OFDM MIMO STBC system only required an Eb / No value of 10.5 dB to achieve BER 10-4. The eye pattern generated by the OFDM MIMO ZF system was more closed and the dispersion of constellation signals away from the ideal point while OFDM MIMO STBC system displayed a more open eye pattern and the dispersion of its constellation signal closer to the ideal point. It indicated more ISI occurs in the OFDM MIMO ZF system than that in OFDM MIMO STBC system.
