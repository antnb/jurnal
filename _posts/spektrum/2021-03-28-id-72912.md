In addition, users also get pick-up mobility ifsomething happens on the road by pressing the emergency button on the device, then thedevice will send a telegram message to the family in the form of the coordinates of the GPSstick location. So that the user of this stick will be easy to find if you need emergency help whenyou are away from home.
