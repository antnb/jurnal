## Abstract:
Time exposure (timex) image is a type of image generated from image acquisition at acertain time or image acquisition with different exposure criteria, the advantage of timex imageis High Dynamic Range which can help provide details in a digital image processing. Toproduce a good timex image, a method is needed that is able to create a timex image fromeither a video or photo source. There are several methods used to produce timex images,namely Gradient-Based Synthesized, Multi-Exposure Image, and Median Filter. In this study,the three methods are compared in producing timex images with input in the form of imageswith over exposure and low exposure as well as video images. For testing the timex image, theHistogram, Standard Deviation, Variance, Mean, Median, and Mode parameters are used.Based on the results of research conducted on timex images with the Median Filter method, thestandard deviation value is 0.0739 and the variance value is 0.0054 where this value indicatesthat the intensity distribution on the median timex filter image has a wider dynamic range thanthe other two methods. The comparison of the timex image with the fps variation shows that thehigher the fps used, the better the timex image.
