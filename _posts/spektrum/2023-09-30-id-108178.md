The Renewable Energy Power Plant that will be designed is a Floating Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Power Plant, as it the potential source of energy considering that Indonesia is located on the equator. The Solar PV Power Plant is designed using the tool from website by utilizing 5% of the surface area of the dam water which is 4,561.97 m2, based on Kementrian PUPR no 6 Tahun 2020 regulation. So that a Floating Solar PV Power Plant capacity of 0.6 MW is obtained by using 1,533 solar modules and produce energy reaching of 926,539 kWh in a year. The designed Floating PV need an initial investment cost of IDR 13,551,481,157, with the result of economic analysis, obtained value of each parameter including the NPV value is IDR 7,470,053,884, BCR is 2.66, and PP is less than 25 years.
