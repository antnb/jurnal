## Abstract:
Water reservoirs are temporary water reservoirs, usually placed at the highest. The communityplaces or installs water reservoirs above the house by using gravity so that the water can run downswiftly. In general, to get clean water, people use PDAM services or use well water. Generally, in urbanareas, the water sources used to supply water reservoirs come from PDAMs or wells (boreholes). In theclean water storage system using an upper reservoir has several problems, such as monitoring theavailable water capacity in the borehole which cannot be known so that the pump will operate for a longtime to fill water and cause damage to the pump, due to the difficulty of monitoring and controlling. Thecondition of the upper reservoir water storage is therefore designed in this study with a prototype"WATER SANDING SYSTEM USING UP TANDON AUTOMATICALLY BASED ONMICROCONTROLLER" which can be monitored via SMS and manually.
