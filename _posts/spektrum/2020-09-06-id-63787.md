## Abstract:
The purpose of the Economic Dispatch is to determine the distribution of each unit inproviding the requested load, so that the load demand can be met at the lowest possible cost takinginto account the limitations of the generator and available system. Commonly the researcher usesome methods to solve economic dispatch, such as Lagrange, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and othersoptimization methods. Latest Artificial Intelligent technology had invented the solution to solve theoptimization problem especially for economic dispatch, its named Imperialist Competitive Algorithm(ICA) which in this project, ICA become the solution to solve economic dispatch problem in Bali 150kV interconnection system. The simulation result the compared by the result using Lambda Iterationand Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. Simulation result show that the ICA method is ableto provide a better solution in Bali 150 kV interconnection system. The difference in generation costsbetween the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) method and the Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) method is 1685.19 $/h or savings are made at 0.24%. While the difference in generation costsbetween the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) method with the Lambda Iteration method is7116.45 $/h or savings are made at 1.03%.
