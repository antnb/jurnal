## Abstract:
Quest Hotel Kuta is a place of business engaged in lodging services. To support operationalneeds, the hotel uses electrical equipment, most of which are inductive. The use of high inductiveloads can produce high reactive power, depending on the power factor because the active powerobtained from the installed power will be less. Based on the measurement results at Quest Hotel Kutathe measured power factor is 0.70, while PLN charges the excess cost of kVARH to the customer ifthe average power factor is less than 0.85. To be able to improve the low power factor can be done byusing a capacitor bank, the capacitor uses the reactive power required at the inductive load. Changingthe power factor in consumers can change. To equalize the power change factor, the capacitor bank isassembled to work multiple steps / multi steps. Multi-step capacitor banks consist of several capacitorswith the same or different capacities. Based on the results of measurements before using the fuzzylogic method, the obtained power factor is 0.70 to 0.74 while the capacitors are installed from 12.5kVAR to 25 kVAR. After using the fuzzy logic controller method the power factor obtained is 0.80 to0.87 and capacitors using the 13.1 kVAR to 22.4 kVAR method. Whereas the power losses beforeusing the fuzzy logic controller method are 26220.5 watts. After using the fuzzy logic controllermethod, the power losses incurred were 23214.45 watts.
