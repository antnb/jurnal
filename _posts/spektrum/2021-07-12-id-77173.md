## Abstract:
Solar Power Plant (PLTS) is a technology to convert solar energy into electricity. RUEN statesthat the potential for solar electricity in Indonesia is estimated at 207.89 GW and it has beendetermined that the national PLTS capacity target in 2025 is 6.5 GW and continues to increaseto 45 GW in 2050. One of the efforts that can be made to achieve this target is to usegovernment buildings as a place to install PLTS. This study was conducted to find out howmuch potential electrical energy is generated on the rooftop PLTS of the North TapanuliRegent's office which has a roof slope of 52.70. It was found that the PLTS of the NorthTapanuli Regent's office has the potential to generate 39.6 kWp of electrical power. Thesimulation shows the energy data produced by the PV system is 45,646 kWh in one year andhas a role in supplying electrical energy up to 52.9%. So the total of the PV system with Gridelectrical energy supplied to the load is 86,233 kWh/year.
