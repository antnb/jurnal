## Abstract:
Stanford University Interim (SUI) is a propagation model developed by the institute ofElectrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). SUI propagation is divided into three conditions,namely conditions A, B and C. Of the three conditions, there is a correction factor (shadowfading) caused by buildings and trees whose values are 8.2 - 10.6 dB. This research willanalyze the comparison of the shadow fading value in the SUI propagation model. The methodused is a simulation using radio atoll planning and drive test measurements on the BTSLTE_Kampus_Udayana, LTE_Jimbaran and LTE_GapuraUdayanaRoad in the Bukit Jimbaranarea. The results of the drive test will be compared with the simulation in Conditions A, B and Cand look for the shadow fading value. The results obtained are for BTS LTE_Kampus_Udayana,LTE_Jimbaran and LTE_GapuraUdayanaRoad closer to condition A with an average differenceof -6.45 dBm, this is supported by the conditions in the three BTS settings where the contoursare hilly and the intensity of the trees and the buildings are high to moderate. As for the shadowfading value, the simulation results were obtained at 8.31 dB and the drive test was 11.47 dB.
