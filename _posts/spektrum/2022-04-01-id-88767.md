## Abstract:
The quality of electric power is influenced by harmonic factors that occur due to animbalance in the load on the power system. This load imbalance results in a current at theneutral point. This amount of current can cause equipment damage and loss of electrical power.Therefore, an earthing system is needed to parse the current flowing at the neutral point and asa safety for the electric power system in a building. The objective of this research was to specifythe impact of the grounding resistance value of the neutral point on the current THD on theMDP installed during peak load conditions at the Electrical Engineering Campus of UdayanaUniversity in Jimbaran. This research method uses simulation with Simulink Matlab software todetermine the effect of neutral point grounding resistance on current THD in areas withcalcareous soils. The simulation outputs indicate that the value of the earth resistance affectsthe THDi value in the electrical system. The simulation outcomes represent that when the earthresistance value is 5 , the THD of the R, S, and T phase currents is feasible at 17.55%, 19.42%, and 8.86%. Then when the resistance value is lowered by 0.5, the THD of the R, S, T phasecurrents is feasible 17.20%, 17.35%, and 8.79%. This shows that more slight the earthresistance number, the smaller the current THD value.
