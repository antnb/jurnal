## Abstract:
"Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui distribusi kekerasan dan menentukan total casedepth baja karbon rendah setelah proses pack carburizing dengan variasi temperaturpemanasan. Penelitian dilakukan dengan menggunakan media karburasi 80% arang tulangkambing dan 20% enrgizer CaCO3. Variasi temperatur pemanasan yang digunakan adalah8500C, 9000C dan 9500C, diholding selama 4 jam dan didinginkan dengan air. Total case depthdiperoleh dengan menentukan kedalaman dimana kekerasan bahan tanpa perlakuan samadengan kekerasan bahan setelah proses pack carburizing. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwasemakin tinggi temperatur pemanasan semakin tinggi distribusi kekerasan. Sampai kedalaman2,5 mm, semakin jauh dari permukaan semakin rendah kekerasan yang dicapai. Total casedepth didapat sampai kedalaman 2,5 mm, setelah itu kekerasan relatif sama antara materialtanpa dan dengan perlakuan. Kekerasan tertinggi diperoleh sebesar 241,629 VHN pada jarak0,5 mm dari permukaan dengan temperatur pemanasan 9500C.Kata Kunci: Total case depth, pack carburizing, energizer, kekerasanThis study aims to determine the hardness distribution and total case depth of low carbon steelafter pack carburizing process with heating temperature variation. The study was conducted byusing a carburizing medium 80% goat bones charcoal and 20% energizer CaCO3. Heatingtemperature variations were carried out at 8500C, 9000C and 9500C, holding during 4 hours andcooled with water. The total case depth was obtained by determining the depth where thehardness of the untreated and treated materials was the same relatively. The results showed thatthe higher heating temperature the higher hardness distribution. The deeper of distance thelower hardness obtained until 2,5 mm depth. The total case depth was obtained until 2.5 mm.After this distance the hardness between untreated and treated materials was the same. Thehighest hardness reached 241.629 VHN at a distance of 0.5 mm from the surface with heatingtemperature 9500C.Keywords: Total case depth, pack carburizing, energizer, hardness"
