## Abstract:
"Abstrak : Suatu tangki penyimpanan air panas yang dalam kasus ini terbuat dari baja nirkarat (stainless steel)mengalami kegagalan karena korosi terutama pada bagian sambungan las. Korosi juga terjadipada bagian bawah tanki. Tanki telah digunakan kurang lebih di bawah satu tahun namun sudahmengalami korosi parah terutama pada bagian sambungan las dan juga mengalami korosi padabagian bawah. Penelitian ini bertujuan mengetahui penyebab terjadinya korosi. Penelitiandilakukan dengan menggunakan teknik pengamatan metalografi langsung dilapangan denganmenggunakan mikroskop metalurgi portable. Hasil pengujian menunjukkan korosi terjadi akibatkorosi galvanik yaitu sambungan dua jenis logam nirkarat yang berbeda dan diperparah denganterjadinya korosi pitting. Pengujian dengan menggunakan sinar X fluorisensi juga membuktikanbahwa pelat bagian bawah tanki dan pelat bagian samping dan atas ternyata memiliki kandunganyang berbeda. Untuk mengatasi hal ini maka teknik pengelasan harus ditingkatkan denganmenggunakan logam pengisi yang tepatKata kunci: tanki, air panas, korosi, baja nirkarat, galvanik, pittingAbstract : Hot water storage tank that was made from stainless still was investigated in this case.

The research was carried out byconducting metallographic examination directly in situ by utilizing portable metallographicmicroscope.

The welding filler also was found not correctlyprepared that make pitting corrosion to occur. It is suggested to conduct advance research toinvestigate the correct composition for the filler during welding.Key word: Tank, hot water, corrosion, stainless steel, galvanik,pitting"
