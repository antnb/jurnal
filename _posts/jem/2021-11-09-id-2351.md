## Abstract:
"The fermentation process of the waste of Eucheuma cottonii seaweed to become bioethanol can beaccelerated by providing special treatment, such as delignification process using NaOCl and immersion byusing a mixture of H2SO4 for different variations. The fermentation process is also be done by using the yeast ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae with a variety of mixtures, to determine the rate of bioethanol fermentation.In this study NaOCl has been used with variation of 0.25%, 0.50% and 0.75%. H2SO4 is used with aconcentration of 0.5% and the variations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast with a ratio of 1: 0.0015; 1: 0.003;1: 0.0045; 1: 0.006 and 1: 0.0075 for every kilogram of waste Eucheuma Cottonii and yeast, and withfermentation time of 3, 6 and 9 days. As a comparison is the same treatment, but without the use of H2SO4.Based on the research, the following results obtained. The highest rate of bioethanol fermentation is4.4% per day and the highest levels of ethanol produced is 14.0%. This is achieved for where each kilogram ofwaste of Eucheuma cottonii is delignificated with a concentration of 0.5% NaOCl followed by a treatment inphysics, with the variations of yeast 1: 0.006 and with a time of fermentation for 3 days."
