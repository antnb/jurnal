## Abstract:
"Abstrak Persaingan pasar tidak sekedar menjual produk akan tetapi membutuhkan kualitas produk yang semakin baik. Kondisi tersebut semakin penting bila dihubungkan dengan permintaan produk yang semakin tinggi. Untuk itu diperlukan pengolahan sumber daya yang semakin efisiensi dan effektif. Sering terjadi proses produksi berhenti dan ditaksir kerugian finansial yang tinggi. Terdapat aktifitas yang bersifat non value added. Aktifitas tersebut menyebabkan timbulnyalosses. Diperlukan cara untuk menelusuri penyebab terjadinya waste atau losses pada aktivitas produksi dengan pendekatan lean six sigma. Tools yang dipakai untuk mengidentifikasi permasalahan adalah E-DOWNTIME waste, RCA (root cause Analisys) dan FMEA (Failure modes and effect analysis). Diperoleh hasil bahwavalue added activity sebesar 22%, necessary but non value added activity yaitu 44% dan nonvalue added activity sebesar 34%. Diperoleh tiga waste kritis yaitu waiting, defect dan excess processing waste. Nilai sigma awal pada defect waste yaitu sebesar 2.70;nilai sigma ini merupakan permasalahan. Rekomendasi perbaikan adalah pembuatan dan pengawasan SOP dan pengadaan pelatihan guna meningkatkan kemampuan dan keterampilan tenaga kerja. Terjadi kenaikan nilai sigma sampai 3.10 dan terjadi pengurangan biaya sampai 25%. Kata Kunci: Losses, activity, RCA, Lean, six-sigma Abstract The market competition is not just selling a product but needs a better product quality. That condition increasingly important when associated with higher product demand. It required the processing resources more efficient and effective.The production process often stops and estimated financial loss is high. There were indications of activities nonvalue added. These activities cause losses. Need a way to explore the causes of waste or losses in production activities with lean six- sigma approach.Tools used to identify the problem are E-DOWNTIME waste, RCA (root cause Analisys) and FMEA (Failure modes and effects analysis).The result was that the value added activity by 22%, Necessary but non-value added activity is 44% and the nonvalue added activity by 34%. There are three critical waste that is waiting, defects and excess waste processing. Sigma value early on waste defect that is equal to 2.70; this sigma value is a problem.Recommendations repairs are create and supervision of the SOP and give a training to improve the capabilities and skills of the workforce. An increasing rate of sigma until 3:10 and a reduction in costs up to 25% Keywords: Losses, activity, RCA, Lean, six-sigma"
