## Abstract:
"Indonesia termasuk negara eksportir furnitur terbesar di dunia. Namun demikian, kualitasfurnitur Indonesia masih kalah bersaing dengan furnitur dari negara-negara seperti Cina,Kanada, Meksiko, Italia, Vietnam, Malaysia dan Taiwan. Salah satu hal yang menyebabkankualitas furnitur Indonesia masih rendah adalah kurangnya penguasaan teknologimanufaktur kayu, dalam hal ini proses permesinan, terutama proses bubut, karenamerupakan proses yang paling banyak dipakai. Kualitas permukaan dari produk yangterbuat dari kayu adalah satu hal yang sangat penting dalam industri furnitur karenadisamping berkaitan dengan masalah estetika juga berpengaruh pada proses manufakturselanjutnya seperti proses finishing dan kekuatan sambungan adhesifnya. Pada penelitianini kayu yang digunakan adalah jenis-jenis kayu yang banyak digunakan sebagai bahanbaku produk furnitur di Indonesia, terutama di pulau Jawa, seperti kayu jati, nangka, mahoni,dan mangga. Spesimen benda kerja diambil dari balok kayu pada arah radial danlongitudinal, dan dibuat berbentuk silinder dengan diameter 30 mm dan panjang 80 mm.Parameter proses bubut yang divariasikan adalah feed rate, karena secara teoritis dan darihasil kajian sebelumnya parameter inilah yang paling berpengaruh terhadap kekasaranpermukaan benda kerja, sementara parameter lainnya seperti cutting speed dan kedalamanpotong dibuat konstan. Dari hasil diperoleh bahwa spesimen yang diambil dari arah radialmemiliki kekasaran permukaan yang lebih besar bila dibanding dengan arahlongitudinal.Dari hasil juga terlihat bahwa semakin besar feed rate yang diterapkan padaproses bubut kayu, semakin besar pula nilai kekasaran permukaannya.Dari penelitian inijuga didapat bahwa kayu nangka memiliki kualitas permukaan yang paling baik biladibandingkan dengan kayu jati, mahoni dan mangga.Kata kunci: Kayu, furnitur, proses bubut, kualitas permukaanIndonesia including the country's largest furniture exporter in the world. However, the qualityof Indonesian furniture still unable to compete with furniture from countries like China,Canada, Mexico, Italy, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan. One of the things that cause lowquality furniture Indonesia still is a lack of mastery of wood manufacturing technology, in thiscase the process of machining, especially turning process, because it is the most widelyused. There are many technological barriers that must be overcome in order to qualitytimber from the machining process could be good. Surface quality of products made fromwood is a very important thing in the furniture industry as well as issues related to aestheticsalso affects the subsequent manufacturing prose like finishing process and the strength ofthe connection adhesive. Therefore, the research to obtain the characteristics of the woodlathe process to obtain high quality furniture products have done the research team. Thisstudy are used the types of wood such as teak, jackfruit, mahogany, and mango.Specimens taken from the work piece wooden beams in the radial and longitudinaldirections, and made cylindrical with a diameter of 30 mm and a length of 80 mm. Latheprocess parameters are varied is the feed rate, because theoretically and from the results ofprevious studies is the most influential parameter of the surface roughness of the workpiece, while the other parameters such as cutting speed and depth of cut made constant.Testing of physical properties and mechanical properties of each timber are also performedas supporting data. From the results obtained that the specimen taken from the radialdirection has a greater surface roughness than the longitudinal direction. In addition, if thegreater the feed rate is applied to the wood lathe, the greater the surface roughness values.The jackfruit wood has the most excellent surface quality when compared with teak,mahogany and mango.Keywords: Wood, furniture, lathing, surface quality."
