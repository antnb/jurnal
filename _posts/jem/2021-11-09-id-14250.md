## Abstract:
"Filter air menyaring kotoran yang dikandung dalam air dengan cara melewatkannya melaluiberbagai rintangan fisik yang halus, melalui proses kimia atau proses biologi. Metoda filtrasidapat dilakukan dengan menggunakan saringan, absorbsi atau pertukaran ion. Filter dapatmenyaring partikel yang dikandung dalam air hingga ukuran lubang saringan yang dapatdilalui oleh air tersebut. Jenis media filter air hingga yang kini masih banyak digunakan diberbagai industri dan rumah tangga adalah dengan media filter pasir, zeolit, dan karbon aktifkarena konstruksinya sangat sederhana sehingga pembuatannya relatif mudah dan murahserta dapat menghasilkan kualitas air yang memadai untuk keperluan industri dan rumahtangga. Pasir aktif merupakan salah satu media yang digunakan Untuk memenuhi kebutuhanmedia filter. Fungsi Pasir aktif adalah untuk menyaring partikel besar/kecil dalam air sekaligusmenjernihkan air. Pasir aktif ini berwarna hitam dan banyak dipergunakan sebagai penggantipasir silika untuk penyaringan tahap awal. Pengamatan besar penurunan tekanan air dalamfilter dengan media pasir aktif telah dilakukan secara eksperimen. Dengan diketahuinyainformasi mengenai besar penurunan tekanan air ini, maka besar penurunan tekanan dalamsistem pipa bisa diperoleh lebih teliti sehingga pemilihan spesifikasi pompa yang diperlukanmenjadi lebih akurat. Sebelum dilakukan eksperimen, karakteristik penurunan tekanan airdalam filter pasir, dipelajari terdahulu menggunakan metode analisis dimensional denganTeorema PI Buckingham. Penurunan tekanan (????P), diameter tabung filter (D), tinggi pasirdalam filter (H), debit aliran air (Q), kerapatan air (????????) dan kerapatan pasir (????p) merupakanvariabel â€“ variabel yang dimasukkan dalam analisis dimensional. Dari analisis dimensionaldiperoleh bahwa tekanan air dalam filter bergantung pada beberapa variabel seperti debit air,rasio diameter tabung dan tinggi pasir filter (D/H). Eksperimen di laboratorium telah dilakukanuntuk mengetahui hubungan antara variabel-variabel tersebut secara teliti serta mengetahuiformulasi penurunan tekanan air dalam filter pasir aktif. Pengamatan telah dilakukan denganmemvariasikan laju aliran air pada beberapa rasio diameter dan tinggi tabung. Kemudianhasilnya juga dibandingkan dengan catridge filter dengan media pasir aktif yang dijualdipasar. Akhirnya, formulasi penurunan tekanan air (????P) diperoleh sebagai berikut:?P = K . . Q2Kata kunci: Filter air, pasir aktif, penurunan tekananThe water filter is used to filter out impurities contained by passing it through a variety ofsubtle physical obstacles, through chemical processes or biological processes. Filtrationmethod can be done by using a sieve, absorption or ion exchange. The filter can filterparticles contained in the water according to the size of the strainer holes that can be passedby the water. Type of water filter media which is still widely used in various industries andhouseholds is the sand filter media, zeolites, and activated carbon because its construction isvery simple so it is relatively easy and inexpensive manufacturing, can produce sufficientwater quality for industrial and household purposes. Active sand is one of the media used tomeet the needs of the filter media. The function of active sand is to filter out large/smallparticles in the water of water purification. Active sand is black and commonly used as areplacement for silica sand for the initial screening stage. Observations of water pressure dropin the filter with active sand media has done experimentally. By knowing the information aboutthe water pressure drop value, then the value of the pressure drop in the pipe system can beobtained more accurately so that the selection of pumps required specifications become moreaccurate. Before the experiment, the characteristics of the water pressure drop in the filtersand, earlier studied using dimensional analysis with Buckingham PI theorem. Pressure drop(?P), the diameter of the tube filter (D), tall sand in the filter (H), the water flow rate (Q), thedensity of water (??) and density of sand (?p) are the variables included in the dimensionalanalysis. From dimensional analysis shows that the water pressure in the filter depends on several variables such as the flow of water, the ratio of the tube diameter and high sand filter(D / H). Experiments in the laboratory have been conducted to determine the relationshipbetween these variables carefully and know the water pressure drop in the formulation ofactive sand filters. Observations have been made by varying the flow rate of water on somehigh ratio of diameter and tube. Then the results are also compared with cartridge filter withactive sand media sold in the market. Finally, formulations of water pressure drop (?P) isobtained as follows?P = K . .
