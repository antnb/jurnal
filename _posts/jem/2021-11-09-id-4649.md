## Abstract:
"This paper presented a shell and tube heat exchanger with type BFU, that is by making its performanceanalysis. Result of this evaluation will be compared to appliance with performance prediction heatexchanger second with type BFS, besides result of the prediction will be compared to result of examinationof second type which done by in PLTA JATILUHUR. This analysis require to be done by because heatexchanger with type of BFU often happened leakage especially at rear head because at the shares quicklyhappened conglomeration of deposit. The detailed design on heat exchanger components was done basedon Standards of Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Association (TEMA). The heat exchanger type that waschosen is BFS type with two shell and two tube passes. According to the chosen heat exchanger geometry,the fluid flow in shell side was analyzed by CFD software to find flow pattern and properties of this fluid.The result of fluid flow analysis with CFD software is accurate enough or close to the theoretical analysisresult. Therefore, it is important to analyze fluid flow along the shell in different surface of cross section withcertain spacing to find completed conditions of fluid. More detailed design and analysis of heat exchangeris needed to have a heat exchanger design that can be fabricated and have good performance."
