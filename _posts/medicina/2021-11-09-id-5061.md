Today, dengue is considered one of the most important arthropod-borne viral diseasases in humans in term of morbidity and mortality. Dengue infection a potential life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) / dengue shock syndrome(DSS), characterized by thrombocytopenia and increased vascular permiability. Thrombocytopenia causes bleeding, but in DHF patients with thrombocytopenia do not always develop bleeding manifestation. The pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia are not cleared. Multiple factors may be involved in the machanisms leading to thrombocytopenia in DHF/DSS patients."
