## Abstract:
"Spondilitis tuberculosis merupakan fokus sekunder infeksi tuberculosis yang mengenai tulang belakang. Keterlibatan tulang belakang akan dapat memperberat morbiditas karena adanya potensi defsit neurologis dan deformitas yang permanent. Diagnosis ditegakkan berdasarkan klinis, laboratories, imaging, bakteriologis dan histopathologis. Sampai saat ini belum ada therapi definitif yang baku. Masih ada kontroversi antara terapi konservative dengan pembedahan. Telah dikembangkan metode total treatment yang merupakan gabungan terapi konservatif dan tindakan operatif berdasarkan identifikasi masalah yang dihadapi masing ? masing penderita.Therapi pembedahan dapat berupa radikal atau middle path, Study of spectrum of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever on children at Sanglah General Hospital Denpasar was done in 2005.Data were collected from medical records.
