However, over time, development around the cultural heritage area is getting faster. Many old buildings with historical value are starting to be abandoned or rebuilt into new buildings. Even though historical buildings, especially cultural heritage, are important assets of the state to maintain the historical value of the nation in order to remain sustainable.
