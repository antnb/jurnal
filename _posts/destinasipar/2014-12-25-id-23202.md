The collected data was then analyzed using qualitative descriptive. As early as the 1960s until today, Kuta is known as the busiest tourist spots in Bali. Understanding the expectations of his own wish fulfillment (hope) the traveler is a long process, to take a long time and are not cheap to achieve something as expected. This expectation for improvement exert towards something better and can be felt. Foreign tourists will want a change in their perceived shortcomings.
