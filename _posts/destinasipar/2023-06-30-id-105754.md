Adventure and play are activities that young people do choose. Welcoming late-night tourists usually focuses on themes of late-night activities, entertainment, and entertainment during the hotel stay. Following this study, a happy and healthy passive comfort model was proposed. Standardization of comfort facilities for the elderly is a recommended program for public tourism facilities as well as resorts, restaurants and cafes and is a recommended strategy for Batam to maintain its presence as a tourist destination for tourists from around the world.
