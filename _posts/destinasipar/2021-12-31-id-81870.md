It uses purposive sampling and snowball sampling to determine and select informants. The data were collected by using a participatory observation by trying mountain bike activities in mountain area and interview the informants. The data analysis applied the content and meaning analysis using a qualitative descriptive method. The theory used in the analysis is adventure approach theory and tourism development components.The results of the analysis reveal that the supporting resources for mountain biking activities that are not yet fully available are contained in the location criteria related to permits and regulations, so that an appropriate plan is needed in order to meet the basic criteria in the completeness of supporting resources for adventure tourism.
