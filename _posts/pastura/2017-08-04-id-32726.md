Part of oil palm frond which can be used as feed include leaf, frond and whole of oil palm frond chopped or shredded. Through processing can increase the crude protein content of oil palm frond from 10.3 to 19.5% and dry matter digestibility to 53.4%. Processing also extend the storing period, so it can be used as a feed stock. Giving up to 55% of the ration dry matter resulted average daily gain in beef cattle to 0.85 kg. It is concluded that oil palm frond can be used as a feed source of fiber through the proper way and support the optimal production of cattle.Key words: cattle, oil palm frond, source of fiber."
