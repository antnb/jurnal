The result of the analysis was presented descriptively using the informal method. The analysis comes to the conclusion that the Crazy Rich Asian movie contains all women’s language features. There are ten women’s language features, namely lexical hedges, tag questions, rising intonation, empty adjectives, precise color terms, intensifiers, hypercorrect grammar, superpolite forms, avoidance of swearwords, and emphatic stress."
