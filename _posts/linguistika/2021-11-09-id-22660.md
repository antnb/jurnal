The result is presented using formal and informal method with inductive and deduktive technique. The result are the syntactic functions contain subject, predicate (core) or nucleus, and objects, the category of subject and object is a noun, while the predicate (nucleus) is a verb and an adjective, and the subject's role is as an actor, the object as a patient, and the predicate (nucleus) describes the activities or circumstances.
