The result is there are some procedures applied by the translator to translate the Balinese cultural terms contain cultural organization aspects; borrowing, literal translation, modulation, equivalence and adaptation.Then, the factors that determine the translator applied those procedures in translating Balinese cultural terms expressing social organization aspects are the linguistic, culture, and translator’s preferences factors."
