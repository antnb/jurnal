Every form of parallelism it?s a fair sharing between unchanging elements and changing elements. More tide of the distribution of unchanging elements, its getting more big differences and variation effectiveness. Parallelism in the text of Dou Sandik GTBN will be explained base on procedure which proposed by Jacobson , which are unchanging elements and changing elements which aim to specify repetition and existing parallels. Kata Kunci: Paralelisme, Dou Sandik, dan Guyub Tutur"
