Once the data were collected, they were classified by the types. The factors constraining the polite choice of address terms then were analyzed. Based on the analysis, there are several types of nominal address terms found in the movie such as name terms, occupational term, title, kinship term and term of endearment. There were three types of name terms found in the object of the study, they are first name, family name and full name.
