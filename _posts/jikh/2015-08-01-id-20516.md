Two out of 10 positive sera samples (3.64%) reacted withthree serovar; 5 (9.09%) reacted with two serovar; and 3 (3.64%) reacted with one serovar. There were fourtypes of serovars detected in this study, namely: Leptospira interrorgans serovar Celledoni, Leptospirainterrorgans serovar Canicola, Leptospira interrorgans serovar Cynopteri dan Leptospira interrorgansserovar Ichterohemorrhagiae.
