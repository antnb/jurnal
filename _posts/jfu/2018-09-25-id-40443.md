## Abstract:
"Mutations in the inhA promoter region are responsible for isoniazid resistance and cross-resistance to ethionamide. To identify mutations with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a pair of primers that can amplify the target region. This aim of this study was to obtain the best primer pair to amplify the inhA promoter region using the Clone Manager Suite 6 program. The inhA promoter sequence (Genbank: U66801) obtained from the www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov was used as a template. The design results obtained the best primer pair tested in vitro using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method. The PCR amplification process was performed for 40 cycles with the following conditions: predenaturase (95oC for 15 minutes), denaturation (94 oC for 1 minute), annealing (56 oC for 1 minute 30 seconds), elongation (72 oC for 2 minutes), and final elongation (72 oC for 10 minutes). Detection of PCR products was performed in agarose gel electrophoresis 1.3% w / v and visualized by UV transluminator tool. The results obtained were forward primers of 5'-GGTCGAAGTGTGCTGAGTC-3 'and reverse primer 5'-TGCTCTTCTACCGCCGTGA-3' which met the good primary criterion based on Clone Manager Suite 6. The pair of primers has been able to amplify the inhA promoter region by the length of product produced at 373 bp."
