It can be concluded that 1) breeders have goodbehavior towards the development of agro-tourism business; 2) breeders gained extra income by participating inagro-tourism activities in order to achieve income by selling their cattle; 3) breeders have better behavior and higherexpectation which is the better perception towards the use of cattle in agro-tourism business activities. Finally,suggestions such as 1) investors in agro-tourism business should co-operate with famers in their surroundingsto run the activities; 2) Breeders should encourage raising cows instead of bulls since they are tame and increasepopulation of cattle in their area; 3) local government should play important role in development of agro-tourismbusiness i.e. village roads construction so it can encourage the visitors to come to the location. All of those willpositively affect the prosperity of local breeders"
