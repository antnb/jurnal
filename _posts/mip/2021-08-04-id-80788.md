The research objective was to examine the role of students as agents of change in sustainable livestock far- ming development. The research variables consisted of students as academicians and 5 dimensions of sustainable livestock development (ecological, economical, socio-cultural, institutions, and technological). The research was conducted using a digital survey method with a likert scale questionnaire +1 to +5 using the google form feature. Respondents are students of the Animal Husbandry Study Program, Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Jember. Data were analyzed partially using simple linear regression using IBM SPSS Statistics 26. The results showed that the role of students had a positive and significant effect on the ecological, the economical, the social-cultural, the institutional, and the technological. The conclusion of the research shows that students have a role as agents of change in sustainable livestock farming development.
