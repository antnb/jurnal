## Abstract:
"The study to the effect of lemon grass fortification on organoleptic and pH of pasteurized milk. The design used a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with four treatments and four replications. The treatments were: P0 = pasteurized milk without lemon grass (control), P1 = pasteurized milk + 5% lemon grass, P2 = pasteurized milk + 10 lemon grass, and P3 = pasteurized milk + 15% lemon grass. The variables observed were: color, taste, aroma, thickness and pH. The results showed that the preference value for color at P0 was significant (P&lt;0.05) with P1 and P3, but P1, P2, and P3 were not significant (P&gt;0.05). Preference for pasteurized milk taste at P0 was significant (P&lt;0.05) with P2, but P1, P2, and P3 were not significant (P&gt;0.05). Preference for the aroma at P0 was significant (P&lt;0.05) with P3, but P1, P2, and P3 were not significant (P&gt;0.05). Preference for the thickness at P0, P1, P2, and P3 were not significant (P&gt;0.05). The pH value of pasteurized milk ranged from 6.54 to 6.64. It can be concluded that lemon grass fortification until the level of 15% was affected on aroma and pH, but not effect on color, taste, and thickness of pasteurized milk."
