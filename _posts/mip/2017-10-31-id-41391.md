## Abstract:
"The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of fish meal substitution with expired milk in diets on theproductivity of cockerels at the age of 2-10 weeks. This study was carried out in Puger Village, Jember Regency,East Java. A Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used with five treatments and five replicates. Totally, therewere 25 experimental units and each unit consists of four cockerels fed without fish meal (R0); 25% diets of fishmeal substitution with expired milk (R1); 50% diets of fish meal substitution with expired milk (R2); 75% diets offish meal substitution with expired milk (R3) and 100% diets of fish meal substitution with expired milk (R4). Dietsand water were given ad libitum. The variables observed were performance and nutrient digestibility. It showedthat cockerels fed 75% diets of fish meal substitution with expired milk (R3) produced higher final body weightand nutrient digestibility (P&lt;0.05) compared to treatment R0, R1, R2 and R4. Treatment R3 produced 75.08%digestibility coefficient of dry ingredient and 72,21% digestibility coefficient of crude protein. It can be concludedthat 75% fish meal substitution with expired milk produced better performance and nutrient digestibility comparedto other treatment."
