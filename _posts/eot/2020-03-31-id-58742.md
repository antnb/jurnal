This was due to a strong commitment and serious action among central government and local government at province and municipality levels for the sport tourism development at the tourism destination in West Sumatera. The commitment could be seen in the serious, strong commitment and coordination between the Ministry of Tourism and the National Road Development Agency at a central government and Heads of Local Departments of Tourism, of Public Works and of Transportation at province and regency/municipality level. The commitment could be seen from the sport tourism management such as the provision of shared budget, event coordination, and destination and infrastructure development and promotion.
