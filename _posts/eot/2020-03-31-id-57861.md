Indonesia, besides having natural resources, also has others potential resources such as culture, ethnicity, local languages, and many more. Those potentials can be further developed as rural destinations.

A qualitative approach is used in this study with Head Village in Sukadana along with community leaders and organizational groups such as Youth Organization, KOMPEPAR (The Driving Force for Tourism), BUMDes (Village-Owned Enterprises), etc. The result of this research finds out the potential resources that already exist in Sukadana like Natural Resources (Cikondang Waterfall, Gunung Padang Site and Tea Plantation) and Human made – not originally designed to attract Tourists and also suggest the activities that will improve the attractions.
