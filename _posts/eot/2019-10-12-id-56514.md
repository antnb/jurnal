The results shows that: 1) Perceived Usefulness is significantly influenced on Attitude Toward Using, 2) Perceived Ease of Use is significantly influenced on Attitude Toward Using, 3) Perceived Usefulness is significantly influenced on Perceived Usefulness, 4) Attitude Toward Using is significantly influenced on Behavioral Intention to Use, and 5) Perceived Usefulness is not significantly influenced on Behavioral Intention to Use in hotel management of non-star hotels in Sanur Bali in using OTA.
