BUMDes Kutuh was established based on Village Regulation Number 5 of 2016 concerning the Establishment of Village-Owned Enterprises. BUMDes Kutuh's efforts to increase village original income are by establishing three work programs, namely the Pancali Spa business unit, the waste transportation service unit, and the goods and services business unit which currently still has problems.This research uses a qualitative research type with a descriptive approach. Based on this research study using the theory of effectiveness by Masruri (2014).
