Badung Regency has a waste problem which is causing Badung Regency as one of the highest waste contributor in Bali. The waste problem is one of the priorities of the Badung Regency Government to overcome.

The purpose of this research is to find out the district government's strategy in implementing Badung Regent Regulation No. 48 of 2018 concerning Guidelines for the Implementation of Reduce, Reuse and Recycles through Waste Banks to realize "Badung Zero Waste"
