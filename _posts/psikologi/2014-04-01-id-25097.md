There are several things that influence adolescent smoking behavior, namely parenting style, peers, personality factors, and also advertisements. Parenting style which will be investigated in this research has three forms namely democratic, authoritarian, and permissive. Permissive parenting style is one form of parenting style which is presumably associated with smoking behavior. Permissive parenting style has characteristics as no child guiding, agreeing child's behavior, and do not use punishment, thus making the child feels brave in doing maladaptive behaviors such as smoking. Since the prevalence of smoking behavior among men is bigger, the researcher wanted to see whether there is a relationship between permissive parenting style of mother and smoking behavior of male adolescents in SMA Negeri 1 Semarapura.
