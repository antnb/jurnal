## Abstract:
"A current research of screening and determination of codeine using Al-TLC Spectrophotodensitometry has been carried out. The separation was performed using TAEA mobile phase. Screening and confirmation were investigated by comparing hRfc of the analyte and hRfc those on data library. Combination hRfc vs correlation also been used as confirmation method, which can be enhanced by spectrum shift reaction using HCl 10% and KOH 0,1 M. The validation parameters were precission, linierity, limit of detection and quantitation (LOD &amp; LOQ) and recovery. TAEA mobile phase performed a good separation among morphine, codeine, caffeine, papaverine and bromhexine standards, which gave Rs value &gt; 1. Test of linierity using regression gave correlation value &gt; 0,99 . LOD and LOQ of Al-TLC were 137.85 ng and 459.63 ng. The recovery of codeine in human plasma using isopropanol as the precipitating agent was 77.1% ± 4.9 (6.5%)."
