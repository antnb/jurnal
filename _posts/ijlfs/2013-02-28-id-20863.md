## Abstract:
"Stature estimation from foot impression plays a vital role in forensic investigation. The present study aims to estimate stature from bilateral foot outlines collected from 240 consenting Bidayuhs (120 males, 120 females) residing in East Malaysia and to generate population-specific equations. Ten outline length measurements were taken viz. five from left and five from right foot. The results indicated high significant positive correlation between height and foot outline lengths. The correlation coefficient (R) in pooled sample (0.854-0.878) shows comparatively higher than those of individual male (0.755-0.779), and female foot outline (0.666-0.750). Linear regression analysis presents smaller error of estimate. Thus, regression equations were derived for stature estimation from foot outlines lengths among Bidayuhs of East Malaysia even when sex remains unknown."
