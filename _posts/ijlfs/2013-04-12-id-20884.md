## Abstract:
"The procedural and cost need for drumstick neutrophyl test as we know is more simple and cheap just than amelogenin DNA test. A few researches show the function of drumstick neutrophyl test and amelogenin DNA test forgender determination especially for live human. But still now there is no researches explain the validity of drumstick neutrophyl test than amelogenin gen by DNA-PCR to determine someone’s gender.This research isto find out the validity of live human’s gender determination, between drumstick neutrophyl test method and amelogenin DNA test method. This research used diagnostic test, with expected sensitifity is 90%. Twenty six blood sample which appropriate with the criteria was analyzed by drumstick neutrophyl test method and amelogenin DNA test method for their gender determination.Statistical analysis was done by two twice two table to determine sensitivity, spesificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio. The sensitifity of drumstick neutrophyl test method than amelogenin DNA test method is 83,33%, the spesifity is 71,43%, the positive predictive value is 71,43%, the negative predictive value is 83,33%, positive likelihood ratio is 2,9167, and the negative likelihood ratio is 0,233375."
