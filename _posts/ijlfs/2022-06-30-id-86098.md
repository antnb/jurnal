## Abstract:
"Pelayanan resep obat di apotek merupakan bentuk pelayanan kefarmasian oleh apoteker. Pelayanan kefarmasian juga dilakukan oleh tenaga teknis kefarmasian (TTK) yang membantu apoteker. Masih ditemukan beberapa kasus kesalahan pemberian obat di apotek. Pada kasus dilaporkan sebuah kesalahan pemberian obat di apotek yang dilakukan oleh tenaga non kefarmasian tanpa pengawasan oleh apoteker dan TTK. Dua orang TTK didakwakan dengan pasal 361 KUHP dengan dakwaan karena kelalaiannya menyebabkan kesakitan pada pasien. Pada analisis ditemukan bahwa kelalaian pemberian obat dilakukan oleh tenaga non kefarmasian tanpa pengawasan. Selain itu, pada apotek pada kasus, juga didapati adanya tanggung jawab yang sama atas pelayanan resep obat pasien oleh semua pegawai, baik TTK atau tenaga non kefarmasian. Analisis kasus dilakukan dengan membandingkan kasus dengan aturan yang berlaku. Berdasarkan peraturan yang berlaku, seorang apoteker dapat dimintakan pertanggung jawabannya atas kelalaian yang dilakukan seseorang yang bekerja di bawahnya dengan dasar vicarious liability. Kedua TTK dinyatakan tidak dapat dibuktikan secara sah dan meyakinkan melakukan tindak pidana sebagaimana didakwakan.”.
