RS Bhayangkara TK IV in Pekanbaru, is currently one of the places for citizens to obtain service due to violence experienced by women and children to Pekanbaru city and surrounding areas. Each year there are about 1300 cases per year of violence against children and women. Services for domestic violence and violence against women and children served by the Integrated Service Center section or known as PPT in RS Bhayangkara through Emergency room, and treated by general practitioners who works 24 hours a day. Considering the availability of forensic specialists in Riau province currently only two people, so it is not possible to serve all cases of forensic medicine like RS.
