This research is conducted with the aim at identifying and mapping the use of English registers in social media Instagram and specifically is to find out the function of the usage of those registers. This research is a-qualitative descriptive research. The method applied for this research is observation method with note-taking and screen shot technique.

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">In society, register is a linguistic phenomenon. Registers are linguistic variants generated by the specific qualities of the user's demands, such as advertising languages, article languages, and others in written language. Meanwhile, we may discover political language, presenter language, parody language, and so on in spoken language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As today's society evolves, people will come across a variety of language occurrences. Social language, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">alay </span><span class="font5">language (Indonesian Pop Culture Language), slang language, and many others are examples. The linguistic phenomena investigated in this study is the English register on the social media platform Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Social media is a trendy way of life that unavoidably 'forces' people to grasp the new way of life if they don't want to be regarded ‘old fashioned’. From a positive standpoint, social media allows people to become freelance writers, freelance journalists, public personalities, online company owners, establish selfimage, and perform a variety of other things. Meanwhile, if people look at the negative side of social media, it easily notices the fraud or illegal activity such as people trafficking. Positive and bad things are constantly existed, like two sides of a coin. Without individuals recognizing it, social media has gradually altered their thinking, attitude, lifestyle, and language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The language style or the linguistic variety shown in social media can be</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">considered as a renewable way of communication. The way of communication refers to expression which not only done orally but also includes pictures. Since there has not many researches explore this issue, the research concerns with register in social media is interesting to investigate. This research is expected to gain insight for the academic community and also common people in the dynamic of language change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are several previous researches that study register among scholars in Indonesia. Mujayyidah et al., (2023) investigated language varieties in social media Instagram and TikTok. The research explores the language variety shown from one of the accounts which last for five consecutive days, and the analysis was done by Sociolinguistic theory. The result of their research showed that the variety of spoken language in the TikTok account @vandarainy included in the social language. The social language signs seen from six aspects, they are zeroization, Diphthongization, graphical changes, lexical changes, onomatopes, ellipsis and mixed codes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hidayati (2023) studied registers among expedition services in Surakarta. Hidayati explored the registers used in expedition service of JNT in Surakarta by applying the purposive sampling. She applied theory of Ramlan for the type of register and theory of Dewa Wijana and Mohamad Rohmadi concerning meaning. It was found that there were 95 registers include JNT Express, JNE Express and Indonesian Post. The classification of the register data consists of single word, directive exocentric phrase, attributive endocentric, acronym, and sentences. The meaning of the registers classified into 77 primary meaning and 18 secondary meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lestari (2023) investigated the registers between buyers and sellers in social media Instagram and TikTok. This research showed that the dominant use of registers in buying and selling thrift shops on Instagram and Tiktok is found to be open envelope registers. The research also found the use of registers that underwent word formation process in the form of clipping or shortening of words, acronyms, abbreviations, code mixing, compounding, inflection and derivations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mauluddin et al. (2023) researched the register among merchants in Bima traditional market. Their research concerns with transaction of merchants by taking utterances of the buyers and merchants in Amahami market as data source. The result of the research shows that there are two types of registers, they are generic form and specific. The specific forms include words and phrases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hariyanto (2022) investigated the register in Gus Baha’s Speech. He applies the illocutionary speech act theory from Searle (1979) to describe the utterances in his lectures and to utilize the discourse of register from Agha (2007) in analyzing the data. The result of the research, it was found that the speaker availed forms of humorous communication strategies in presenting religious lectures. Thos forms of communication become a distincgtive feature compared with other preacher to attract the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CY Lubis et al (2016) conducted research concerning register in online shop term in Facebook. They applied theory register of Holmes (1992) and Pateda (1987) about type and function of register as the framework of their research. Their finding shows that from 100 registers that they found, there are 11 registers identified as abbreviations, 13 for clippings, 3 coinages, 2 acronyms, 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">compounding, 35 borrowings, and 28 phrase. In terms of function, it was found registers functioned as consultative (45), deliberative (16), casual (14), intimate (6) and oratorical (2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus, the previous studies regarding register research contributing in this article as literature reviews in emphasizing the knowledge specifically in register research.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Instrumental Function</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Besides giving information, it can also be found that the registers in social media Instagram shows the instrumental functions.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">The data shows English registers in all posts. There is no use of the Indonesian language can be found in the data of LOGO HOUSE post. The data not only contains information but also instrumental function. The information function is shown in the description of the Artotel hotel with its advantages. Can be seen in the sentence “Some days you’re engaging with the crowd, some days are the opposite……”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The instrumental function can be defined as language that is oriented towards the listener or speech partner. The language used to regulate the listener's behaviour so that the interlocutor wants to obey or follow what the speaker or writer expects. This can be done by using expressions that state requests or appeals. They can be identified from greeting words or in the form of appeal words. The words shown in the above data can be seen in the sentence: &quot;Spend the night in its cozy room and let your beautiful mind wander through!&quot; Readers who read the post are invited to spend the night in a comfortable Artotel hotel room and make their beautiful minds wander in a comfortable atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The above data shows the functions of other instrumental registers because in the posting of the data you can see words of invitation to take part in 'THIS EARTH HOUR' activities. The word or sentence of invitation referred to is 'Get your friends and join us to celebrate our planet'. In Indonesian it means more or less 'Invite your friends and together we celebrate our planet'. In addition to the data, it also contains an information function because the language used is informative language regarding the activities that take place at the Discovery Shopping Mall entitled 'THIS EARTH HOUR'</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">In concluding the research, the identification of the English usage in social media Instagram was found in relatively small numbers.</span></p>
