<p><span class="font3">This research aimed at analyzing the speech act performed by the characters in Matilda Wormwood movie. This study was carried out in the form of a descriptive qualitative study. The major data sources were utterances in the Matilda Wormwood movie. The movie screenplay was also employed as a supplementary source in this research. The data were obtained using observation and documentation procedures, and they were evaluated using the steps of data condensation, data presentation, and conclusion drafting. The research findings revealed that utterances employed in the form of the locutionary act, the type of the illocutionary act, and classification of speech act. The most dominant the locutionary act utilized by the research subject is a declarative form, which consisted of 37% of the total data. Then, the most prevalent the illocutionary act used by the research subject is a representative type, which consisted of 36% of the total data. Since the form and type of the research subject's most prominent speech act are relevant. Furthermore, the research subject's utterances are frequently given directly in sequence, which Yule's theory refers to as a direct speech act. This research increased the knowledge and comprehension of the many forms and types of speech act in society purposes of language.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In society, language is needed as a tool to communicate with each other. Austin (1962) states that the listener and the speaker are involved in the communication process. To make the communication process running well, the speaker and the listener should use the same language. However, the communication process was not as simple</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">as people thought because in that process the speaker should think how to deliver the message to the listener through the utterances while the listener should understand about the meaning of the utterances that the speaker said to avoid misunderstanding in the communication process. Through language, the speaker cannot only state the exact meaning about something (ideas, feelings and thoughts) however, it also can make the listener acted toward the utterances said by the speaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Searle (1969), the concept of speech act evolved into three actions that occur concurrently when someone utters a sentence; these acts are locutionary act, illocutionary act, and perlocutionary act. The form of the speech in which it had the literal meaning is referred to as the locutionary act. Declarative form, interrogative form, imperative form, and acclamation form are the four structural forms. Declarative form is an utterance that contains a statement or information about something. Interrogative form refers to a speech in the form of a question. Meanwhile, imperative form is an utterance that takes the shape of an order, invitation, warmth, congratulation, and so on. Exclamation form is an utterance intended to communicate the speaker's immediate feelings about something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The function of the speech is the illocutionary act. According to Searle, there are five categories of utterances depending on their purpose, such as declarative (the utterance used to change the circumstance), which is further classified as declaring, affirm, bless, and dismiss. The second kind is representational, in which the speaker's utterance is utilized to represent the surroundings in order to persuade the listener of what the speaker stated. It is divided into six sub-functions: swear, inform, assert, deny, claim, describe, and report. The third function is expressive, in which the speaker used the speech to indicate how he or she felt. Condolences, praise, thanks, sorrow, congratulation, criticism, complaint, and swearing were all forms of expressive. The speech also had the role of directing the listener to do what the speaker stated, which is known as directive. The directive function is divided into five sub-functions: ask, invite, order, request, and recommend. And the last sort of utterance is termed commit since it shows the speaker's commitment to some future activity. Refuse, promise, and commit are all sub-functions of commit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The perlocutionary act is the effect of the speaker's speech on the listener. When the speaker makes an utterance, it can cause the listener to believe, be irritated, terrified, enlighten, inspire, affirm, reject, obedient, inform, comprehend, happy/satisfied, astonished, and it can also cause the listener to do something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Parker (1986) also made a contribution to speech act by classifying speech act into direct speech act and indirect speech act. A direct speech act is one in which the structural form and function of the utterance are comparable. In contrast, an indirect speech act is a speech act whose function does not correspond to its structural form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The movie can be a useful of the field for identifying speech acts because it depicted many speech acts in diverse situations, implying that the actors generated a large number of utterances. People might also identify different forms and purposes of the language utilized in the film. The cinema is a kind of visual communication that uses moving images and sound to tell tales or teach people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Matilda Wormwood movie is one of the best children's movies with character education elements. The film was released in 1996. Matilda recounts a narrative about the life of a brilliant little girl named Matilda. The narrative began with Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood, who were unconcerned about her daughter. Wormwood, Matilda They did not provide their children the care and affection that parents should. Despite the fact that she was only three years old, she shown bravery and independence in order to go</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">through her life. She had a natural talent to read and communicate from a young age. Their parents did not encourage and value her learning progress. She did, however, enjoy her life by reading books. She simply sat in the corner of her room and read books to learn about the world. It is followed by Matilda's school life, which discusses her learning activities. forming a friendship Her struggle to learn in the local school, as well as her helpfulness to her peers and instructors at school Matilda by Roald Dahl was named Children's Book Award winner, and it was also named one of the top 100 greatest children's books in a poll published in School Library Journal. Furthermore, Roald Dahl's work Matilda was turned into a film with the same title in 1996, directed by Danny DeVito. Regarding to the Internet Movie Database (IMD6) and Rotten Tomatoes, a service that gives information on films worldwide, this film adaptation garnered a good response from the audience. As a result, this film has unequivocally regarded that excellent to be implanted in youngsters in order to grow their character education ideals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Previous study has shown that there have also been several researchers who have carried out the use of speech act with the same topic. The first, Rahmawati (2021) studied that an analysis of expressive speech acts used in the Crazy Rich Asian movie. Data were collected by means of the researcher uses observation methods as the methods of collecting the data. The results showed that the researcher found there were 52 data of expressive speech act and only ten types of expressive speech found in Crazy Rich Asian movie, some of the expressive types appeared except expressive act of condole and boast. The second, Marbun (2020) studied that an analysis of speech act used in the Grown Ups movie. Data were collected by means of the researcher uses observation methods as the methods of collect the data. The results showed that the researcher found there were 30 utterances of speech acts in Grown Ups movie. From the 30 data that researcher collected, the main characters most expressed the types of speech act. They are 6 locutionary acts, 15 illocutionary acts, and 9 perlocutionary. Thus, this present research is important to conducted because readers would get more insights on types and function of speech act performed by all characters in Matilda Wormwood movie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Matilda Wormwood by Roald Dahl was chosen by the researcher because it is one of the top 100 greatest children's books and has been turned into a film. This film will be remembered as the finest children's film of all time. Besides. The novel Matilda by Roald Dahl was turned into a film of the same name directed by Danny DeVito in 1996. According to the Internet Movie Database (IMD6) and Rotten Tomatoes, a service that gives information on films worldwide, this film adaptation garnered a good response from the audience. It implies that the film is not just appropriate for youngsters, but also for people of all ages. Furthermore, this film is entertaining to watch since it contains three genres: children's, humor, and fantasy. The narrative also includes a touch of imagination in the events of the story, which may increase children's motivation to watch, as well as many good values and conventions. Matilda urges all youngsters to love watching television. As a result, the study anticipates that by seeing Roald Dahl's in Matilda Wormwood movie, the audience will be motivated and will be able to apply the good principles learned in the tale of this film to their daily lives. In order to develop the previous researchers and found various forms and types of speech act used produced by all characters in this movie, the researcher conducted the study which entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“An Analysis of Speech Act Used in Matilda Wormwood Movie”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods Research Design</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The researcher conducted paper descriptive qualitative research in this report, with the data acquired from this study taking the form of words rather than statistics. According to Bogdan (1992), as referenced in Moleong (2007), descriptive qualitative research is a research method that generates descriptive data in the form of written words of individuals or observed behavior. According to Bogdan (1992), as stated in Moleong (2007), descriptive qualitative research as a type of study aiming at characterizing occurrences was both natural and human engineering. He said specifically that paper descriptive qualitative research was study focused at understanding the phenomena of anything experienced by research objects, such as behavior, perception, motivation, action, and etc. Holistically, by describing them in the form of words and language in a specific natural setting using various scientific approaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Sugiyono (2008), descriptive qualitative research is research used to examine the condition of natural objects in which the researcher is the main instrument, using inductive qualitative as the technique of data collection and analysis, and the results of this research prioritize the meaning of something. This descriptive qualitative research was undertaken to investigate certain things, particularly humans, in terms of behavior, grammar/speech, perception, and so on. In which the researcher functioned as the principal instrument, collecting data, organizing data, and interpreting the data themselves, producing data in the form of words that were examined and concluded in the form of descriptions. The purpose of descriptive qualitative research was to create a systematic, factual, and correct account of a fact, the nature, and the interaction between phenomena in a specific situation.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Research Subject</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Research subjects in this research were the characters who play a role in the Matilda Wormwood movie, among others Matilda, Mrs. Trunchbull, Mr. Wormwood, Mrs. Wormwood, Michael, Miss Honey, Amanda Thripp, Lavender, Mrs. Phelps, Nigel Hicks, Bruce Brogtrotter, Magnus, Jullius Rottwinkle, and Hortensia (Dahl, 1996).</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Research Source</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">This study image on two types of data sources: primary and secondary. A primary source is one that delivers data to the researcher directly. This study focuses on the utterances performed by all characters in Matilda Wormwood movie, a one-hour and thirty-eight-minute in the movie. Meanwhile, secondary sources, such as notes or another document, do not directly supply data to the researcher. In this study, the researcher will utilize the script of Matilda Wormwood movie, written by Nicholas Kazan and Robin Swicord, as a secondary source to help the researcher interpret and analyze the research subject's utterances.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Data Collection</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">There were several techniques and instruments of data collection that are used in this study. These techniques and instruments are explained below:</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The Technique of Data Collection</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The data collection technique is the method utilized by the researcher to obtain the data required for the research project. The approaches of observation and documentation were utilized in this research investigation. According to Saldana (2011), the observation approach aims to capture individuals (or characters in literary works)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">in genuine action, reaction, and interaction, as well as deduce their way of thinking and feeling. The observation method was used in this study to capture all characters produced in the form of naturalistic actions, reactions, and interactions by examining the utterances she produced in the movie with the four non-linguistic context elements proposed by Holmes, namely, participants, setting, topic, and function. Furthermore, the researcher reviewed the movie screenplay to have a better comprehension of the utterances performed by all characters in the Matilda Wormwood movie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second technique was documentation, in which the researcher made important notes about utterance produced by all characters in Matilda Wormwood movie, which is who the listener was when the utterance was produced, what situation of the speaker and the listener when the utterance was produced, and the function or purpose of the utterance being produced. These notes or records aim to support sorting the necessary and unnecessary data and also to facilitate the researcher to analyze the locutionary act based on the theory proposed by Austin, included five types in the illocutionary act (representative, directive, expressive, commissive, and declarations) based on Searle's theory. The data also will be classified into direct speech act or indirect speech act according to Yule's theory.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Instrument of Data Collection</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">According to Miles (2014), in qualitative research, the researcher is the primary instrument of data collection. It is because the researchers’ cognitive such inferring, intuiting, empathizing, and evaluating are count as the data as well. Therefore, in this research, the researcher himself is the main instrument in which will be a designer, a data collector, an analysis, a data interpreter, and a reporter of the research finding. To support the observation technique, the researcher used another instrument that was a table of non-linguistics context aspects based on Holmes’s theory. Moreover, to support the documentation technique, the table of data collection is used. It will help to note the speech act from the forms of locutionary act, types of the illocutionary act, and the classification of the speech act into direct or indirect.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Data Analysis</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">There are three concurrent flows of activity of data analysis that will be used in this study. They are explained as follows:</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Data Condensation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">According to Miles (2014), the data condensation as the process that including selecting, focusing, simplifying, abstracting, or transforming the raw data. The previous form, which is data reduction being abounded because it seems to have a meaning to weakening or losing something in the process. The data condensation in this research will be applied to transform the raw data obtained from data collection activity into an explanation of selecting utterances produced by all characters in the Matilda Wormwood movie for focusing on the forms of locutionary act and the types of the illocutionary act, and the classification of the speech act in direct or indirect.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Data Display</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The data obtained in the analysis activity should be made of long paragraphs and dispersed over many pages that make it is not easy to see as a whole. In data display, the information presented visually in a systematical format so the researcher can draw conclusions and take needed action. The format in displaying the data proposed by Miles (2014) are matrices that are two lists set up as rows and columns. The other one is</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">called the network that is a series of nodes with links in the form of lines and arrows between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The explanation from data condensation in this research then will be shown using matrices that consist of rows and columns or, in other words, called a table. It has a purpose to help the researcher in analyzing the data. The table will be displayed into three data tabulation forms. The first tabulation form is used for calculating how much the frequency and percentage of data found in the forms of locutionary act (declarative, imperative, interrogative, and exclamation). The second tabulation data form was used to calculate how much frequency and percentage of the types of illocutionary acts (declarative, representative, expressive, directive, and commissive). The last, the third tabulation data used to calculate the frequency and percentage of classification of the speech act into direct or indirect.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Conclusion Drawing and Verification</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">According to Miles (2014), from the beginning of the data collection process, the researcher already holds the conclusion in a vogue way, but by maintaining openness and skepticism then it leads to increasingly explicit and grounded. The appearance of final conclusions depended on some aspects such as the coding, storage, and retrieval methods used, the researchers' experiences, and any necessary deadlines to be met. The conclusion needs to be verified in order to be approved in its credibility, sturdiness, and conformability. Verification may be in a brief form as the researcher summing up her thought during the writing process or can also be in the form of length thorough argumentation and review.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this research, after all the steps of data collection and data analysis process are done, then a conclusion can be drawn and then be verified. However, the researcher might draw a conclusion and verify it more than once by going back to three steps before. It is purposed to get the most convincing the data. That is why the process is called as the interactive and cyclical process of the data.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Research Trustworthiness</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">To show that the research study is credible, the research must have triangulation. Triangulation aimed to support the findings, which is Miles (2014) states that by showing at least three trustworthiness. In this research, credibility was obtained by applying independent measures of it agree with it or at least do not contradict it. Triangulation could be obtained by multiple measures like data sources, methods of data collection, or theories. Moreover, this research will use triangulation based on the theories. The three theories from experts are used to support the findings in the speech act contained in the Matilda Wormwood movie. The three theories are proposed by Austin, Searle, and Yule. The first is the theory of three related acts from Austin. The second is the types of the illocutionary act from Searle. The third is the classification of the speech act into direct or indirect from Yule.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Research Procedure</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Some procedures have been conducted by the researcher in collecting the required data. The procedures are as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observing the research subject in which in this research is all characters in the Matilda Wormwood movie, while listed an utterance produced by the actors and actress.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing a note relating to context proposed by Holmes in which were participants, setting, topic, and function of the utterance being produced.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the script of the Matilda Wormwood movie in order to ensure that the data obtained in the form of utterances are in accordance with the existing script. This step also helped the researcher to get a better understanding of the utterances being produced.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing the forms of the speech act based on Austin's theory, the types of the illocutionary act based on Searle's theory, and the classification of the speech act from Yule's theory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculating the frequency and percentage of the forms of the locutionary act, the types of the illocutionary act, and the classification of the speech act into direct or indirect.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding and Discussion</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This sub-chapter presents the findings of the study. There were some data found after the research observed the research subject which of all characters in Matilda Wormwood movie. The data had been found were in the forms of utterances produced by all character of Matilda Wormwood movie. Then, those utterances being compared to their own script to help the researcher verified the data that made the analysis process was easier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As previously mentioned, when the speaker delivers the utterances, three acts occur concurrently. The locutionary act, illocutionary act, and perlocutionary act are the three actions. The two acts, the locutionary act and the illocutionary act, are both theories of speech actions that deal with the speaker. Meanwhile, perlocutionary activities addressed to the hearer or listener. Since the purpose of this study are to describe the forms and types of speech acts performed by all characters in the Matilda Wormwood movie. The research findings only revealed the locutionary act forms and the illocutionary act types. The data was then identified and classed as direct or indirect of the speech act.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>The Form of The Locutionary Act</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">There is the following of the data found during the observation of the forms of the locutionary act that carried out by the researcher as follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Table 1. The Data Tabulation of Form of The Locutionary Act</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font3">From the table above, there are 250 data found in which they are divided into four forms of locutionary act. The first, declarative form consisted of 94 data. The second, interrogative form consisted of 55 data. The third, imperative form consisted of 72 data. The last, exclamation form consisted of 29 data.
