<p><span class="font7">The SoSPS1 gene of sugar cane plants previously subjected to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefacien</span><span class="font7">-mediated cloning was to be transferred to citrus plants to increase metabolism of sucrose in plant. The T-DNA harbored the SoSPS1 gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter from the cauliflower mosaic virus and contained the NPTII gene (kanamycin resistance gene) as a selectable marker for transformant selection. Generally, gene transformation in plants is carried out by tissue culture. However, tissue culture has several disadvantages such as its being time-consuming, its sometimes resulting in somatic mutations and somaclonal variations, and the requirement of sterile conditions in the procedure of gene transfer. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">In planta</span><span class="font7"> transformation is a useful system for those plants that lack tissue culture and regeneration system. The main function of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> transformation is to recover the advantages of tissue culture as an efficient, quick method, including its ability to produce a large number of transgenic plants and to accumulate a high concentration of total soluble protein in short time. There are two procedures of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> transformation for the seeds of citrus plants, namely “prick and coat” and “seed tip-cutting and imbibition”. In the prick and coat method, seeds are pricked on their entire surfaces and smeared with a suspension </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.</span><span class="font7"> In the seed tip-cutting and imbibition method, on the other hand, seeds are cut at the tip and soaked in a suspension of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font7">. </span><span class="font6">The leaves derived from seeds treatment were taken as samples for DNA extraction and PCR using primers of the NPTII gene (Forward: 5’-GTCATCTCACCTTCCTCCTGCC-3’; Reverse: 5’-GTCGCTTGGTCGGTCATTTCG-3’). This research found that only the </span><span class="font7">seed tip-cutting and imbibition </span><span class="font6">plants amplified along the 550-bp band, while those of the prick and coat method did not. Additionally, the T-DNA was successfully integrated into the genome of the plants treated with the </span><span class="font7">seed tip-cutting and imbibition </span><span class="font6">method but not with the prick and coat.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Orange is one of the commodities classified as high-value fruits important to both the domestic and the world markets, both in fresh and processed forms. Based on Agriculture Statistics (2017), in 2016, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">national citrus consumption per capita increased by 9.76%, while the export volume decreased by 10.5% due to a decrease in the quality of citrus products in Indonesia. Data showed that orange has a high economic value, necessitating improvement of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">quality of the products and the variety in order to achieve high variety, high production, sweet taste, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the desirable qualities in orange is sweet taste. Improvement of such quality can be performed through insertion of the SoSPS1 gene, a gene that encodes the sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) protein, cloned from sugar cane plants as a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of sucrose in the plant, resulting in increases in metabolism (photosynthesis) and the level of sucrose in plants (Sugiharto </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 1997).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Improvement of the plant variety can be carried out conventionally through crossbreeding or in a modern mode through genetic engineering or genetic transformation</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font7"> Insertion of gene by crossbreeding has the following weaknesses: 1) the process of the gene incorporation is uncontrollable, and the gene expression is unstable and 2) out-crossing becomes impossible. Improvement of variety by genetic transformation can overcome the weaknesses of conventional practices, and the stability of gene transfer in the genomes of plants will be tested through molecular stages. Genetic transformation is the process of introducing a gene from one organism to another directly via particle bombardment (Hansen and Wright, 1999), the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG), and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">electroporation (D'Halluin </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 1992) and indirectly via the help of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumafaciens</span><span class="font7"> (Ishida </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 1996; Zhao </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al., </span><span class="font7">1998; Negrotto </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 2000; Frame </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al., </span><span class="font7">2002; Dwiyani </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 2016;).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Indirect transformation using </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumefacienss</span><span class="font7"> is better than direct transformation because this method is more effective and efficient in application in that, in indirect transformation, the laboratory practice is simple, and the insertion of the gene more stable, than in direct transformation, resulting in higher stability in the gene expression and less genome alteration of the plant transformant (Hansen &amp;&nbsp;Chilton, 1996; Dai </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 2001; Nishimura </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 2006; Rahmawati, 2006; Mohammed and Abalaka, 2011).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The utilization of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> in this study was based on the microbe’s ability to infect dicot plants and cause tumors on the trunk (Larebake </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 1974). </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumafaciens </span><span class="font7">is also able to transfer recombinant tumor genes into transformation vectors (Dwiyani </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 2016). Insertion mediated by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumafaciens</span><span class="font7"> has been successfully carried out on monocotyledonous plants such as rice (Raineri </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 1990; Park </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 1996; Komari </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 1998), maize (Ishida </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al., </span><span class="font7">1996), and banana (May </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 1995).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Genetic transformation can be performed </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font7"> or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7">. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">In vitro </span><span class="font7">transformation generally involves the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">introduction of genes into the callus with which plants are to regenerate. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro </span><span class="font7">method comes with some disadvantages: 1) this method is time-consuming; 2) there is a somatic mutation or somaclonal variation in plant cells during the tissue culture; and 3) the process of gene transfer requires a sterile media condition. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> transfer method can overcome such disadvantages of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font7"> method. It is essentially simple, efficient, stable, and productive of genes that replicate through a single insertion in the genome (Birch, 1997).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> method involves soaking by which the pollens of flowering plants are inserted without going through the phase of tissue culture (Feldmann and Marks, 1987; Feldmann, 1992). Several types of plants on which </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> genetic transformation has been successfully conducted are </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Medicago trunttula</span><span class="font7"> (Trieu </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7"> 2000), </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Arabidopsis thaliana</span><span class="font7"> (Bent 2000), apple, pear, tomato, peach, strawberry (Spolaore </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 2001), and orange (Ahmad and Mirza, 2005).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to Bhojwani (1979), orange seeds are capable of polyembryonic seeds development in which one seed can develop into more than one embryo. Polyembryony produces zygotic embryo from the fusion of male and female gametes in the nucellus which is formed of an embryo sac. Nucellar embryony is somatic</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">embryogenesis in which a single cell develops into a group of meristematic cells. Nucellar embryos will grow uniform to the parent into tap roots related to the quality of the fruit which are able to exploit the extreme conditions of the soil and be resistant to specific diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Research on the implementation of this method on orange polyembryonic seeds is needed. The method is innovated from the combination of the prick and soak method (prick and coat) (Sanjaya, 2018) and the imbibition method (seed top-cutting and imbibition). The methods of treatment of the objects of this research are 1) prick and coat (seeds are pricked on the entire surface and smeared with a suspension </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of Agrobacterium tumefacien</span><span class="font7">), a method inspired by the prick and soak method, and 2) seed top-cutting and imbibition (seeds are cut at the tip and soaked in a suspension of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefacien</span><span class="font7">), a method adapted from the imbibition theory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The transformation method used was the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> transformation. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">In planta </span><span class="font7">transformation is the process of direct gene transfer to parts of plants that undergo</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">meristematic phases, one of which is the seed (somatic embryogenesis). This is because the gene replication in the plant genome takes place in a large amount, making the gene</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">stable and reproducible. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">In planta </span><span class="font7">transformation is more efficient than </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro </span><span class="font7">method. It is considered simple and easy to do because it targets </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ex vitro</span><span class="font7"> plants</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font7"> or plants that are not derived from tissue culture. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">In planta</span><span class="font7"> transformation offers a solution to the weaknesses of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font7"> method: the process requires a long period of time and more skilled labor, and it may generate somaclonal variation (Kalbande and Patil, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> method performed on orange seeds in the present research was modified from the prick and soak method by Sanjaya (2018) in which seeds were pricked and coated with a suspension of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> (TL). Besides, a method adapted from the seed imbibition theory (Salisbury and Ross, 1992) called seed tip-cutting and imbibition (PR) was also used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The results of the use of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta </span><span class="font7">method are shown in Table 1, and the results of the PCR analysis in Fig. 4. From the incorporation of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> on 60 seeds in the treatments and control, it was found that the transformation in the seed tip-cutting and imbibition (PR) treatment amounted 16.7%, in the prick and coat treatment (TL) 0%, and the control 0%. The seed tip-cutting and imbibition (PR) generated a good level of efficiency but improvement is necessary by several factors: 1) soaking of orange seeds in suspension and 2) temperature of the citrus</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">plant seeds germination (Lester, 2019). The seed tip-cutting and imbibition method (PR) integrates the NPTII gene into the plant genome. Based on the visualization of the PCR results, amplification took place along the 550-bp band (Fig. 4. A), and analysis continued between five replicates (Fig. 4. B), generating the same results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The suspension of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumefaciens </span><span class="font7">consists of nutritious MS medium, colonies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumefaciens</span><span class="font7">, and acetosyringone. According to Salisbury and Ross (1992), high-concentration </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> suspension is able to go into low-concentration seed cells. Seed imbibition is the spontaneous absorption of liquid by porous, dry material. In polyembryony, the highly porous orange seeds were infiltrated with the suspension through the passive transport of osmosis, with the structure of the pores affecting the rate of the suspension absorption. (Jean </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7">, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The factor for the transformation success in this study was the use of TWEEN20, transformational explants, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">acetosyringone</span><span class="font7"> (AS). Clough and Bent (1998) stated that the administration of surfactant at a low concentration on the immersion medium by the floral-dip method can increase the number of transformants obtained in the plant </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Arabidopsis thaliana</span><span class="font7">. TWEEN20 is one of surfactant types which serves to lower the tension of the surface of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the cell, reducing the hydrophobicity of the plant and bacterium cells and facilitating the attachment of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> in the plant cells (Miller, 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The explants also influenced the success of the transformation. It was associated with the physiological process the plant organs were engaged in. Endogenous phenol compounds in seeds function as active agents that stimulate germination in anaerobic conditions. Total phenol varies according to the type or variety. Phenol compounds in seeds will naturally be active in the imbibition process (Pramono, 2017). They have a major influence and role in activating virgen to release T-DNA from plasmids and deliver T-DNA to plant cells to be integrated with plant genomes. Additionally, the increase in the concentration of synthetic acetosyringone (AS) will influence efficiency and success and shorten the time of immersion in eggplant seeds (Chumakov, 2007).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Based on the data in Table 1, the seed tip-cutting and imbibition method (PR) had a percentage of transformative efficiency of 16.7%, and this success rate can be increased by internal factors of orange seeds (the physiological state of recalcitrant seeds): the imbibition process time. Citrus plants seeds which have a porous structure require only a short period of time. Soaking for 30 minutes is less efficient, causing hypersensitivity to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the cell seeds. According to Jones and Dangl (2006), hypersensitive reactions are generally active during attacks of pathogens in molecular plant cells. The stages begin with the plant recognizing the incoming pathogens and starting to activate the resistance system. Meanwhile, the pathogens successfully deploy effector that are virulent. Effectors that are recognized by the plant's immune system send signals to nucleotides. The nucleotides resist pathogens by means of lethal cells (hypersensitive reaction).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The second factor was seed germination temperature. In this study the seeds were germinated at medium humidity, giving the seeds a stress and leading to a decrease in metabolism. The decrease in the seed quality was indicated by an increase in the fat content. Fungi attack the seeds during germination at normal humidity, matter is the result percentace growing from citrus plants is low and also affects the percentage of putative efficiency of transformed plants (Worang </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 2008). Meanwhile, a high content of fatty acids indicates that the process of respiration was high, causing the seeds to lose energy for germination. Germination of seeds would run well at an optimum temperature of 14 ºC, stored under a dry, cold condition. This is because the quality of the seeds would be optimal under such conditions, thereby increasing the speed of growth. (Pradhan and Badola, 2012).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The inhibiting factors in the transformation by the prick and coat method (TL) included the puncturing of the seeds and the use of explants. The seeds used was recalcitrant ones, which have high levels of water to maintain the vigor and viability of the seeds. Pricking treatment would reduce the quality of the orange seeds. The biochemical indicators (fat, protein, carbohydrate) in the seeds which experienced a decline in the quality showed a change in the activity of the enzyme, a change in the rate of respiration, a change in the food reserves, a change in the membrane, a damage to chromosomes, and accumulation of toxic materials (Tatipata, 2008). The pricking process would decrease the water level and germination power of the seeds, so the fat content in the seeds tended to increase and the carbohydrate and protein levels</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">decrease, causing the seeds to lose energy for germination (Yuniarti </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 2008).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The puncturing of the seeds will cause a state of collapse to the cells as shown in Fig. 5. The seed sell collapse during the incorporation of the suspension of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> would inhibit the production of ATP in the cells by poisoning of the mitochondria. So genes that throught to insertion not be replicated and the gene is not amplified in the genome of plants. Potential damage to cell membranes due to puncture and infection with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> indicates that the supply of ATP influences the success of the gene replication process. Then, based on the rigidity of the cells, it is important to carry out genetic transformation and health maintenance of the citrus seeds (Salisbury and Ross, 1992).</span></p>
