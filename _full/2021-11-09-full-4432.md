Sumber data dalam penelitian ini diambil secara acak dari beberapa Majalah bahasa asing bulanan. Ada lima buah iklan cetak yang digunakan sebagai data terdiri dari</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Maybelline ‘s Moisture Extreme Lipcolor, Sally Hansen’s Mega Shine Nail Top Coat, Dove Deodorant , Loreal ‘s Kiss Proof Ultra Glossy Lipstick, Maybelline’s Volum’ Express Turbo Boost Mascara. Analisis dalam penelitian ini dilakukan melalui beberapa langkah. Pertama, iklan yang diperlukan diidentifikasi dan data diklasifikasikan. Setelah itu, makna verbal dan visual yang digunakan dalam iklan dan apa yang mereka menandakan dianalisis berdasarkan teori Dyadic diusulkan oleh Saussure, hubungan antara makna verbal dan visual dalam iklan dianalisis menggunakan teori Semiotik diusulkan oleh Saussure juga (Saussure, seperti dikutip dalam Chandler 1997).
