<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tulisan ini berjudul </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Semiotic Study on Visual and Verbal Signs of Taylor Swiftʼs Music Video” You Belong With Me ʻ and Its Song Lyrics” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yang bertujuan untuk mengidentifikasi unsur–unsur tanda visual yang ditampilkan di dalam video musik dan menganalisis makna tanda verbal yang terkandung di dalam lirik lagu dari video musik. Sumber data diambil dari video dan lirik lagu “You Belong With Me oleh Taylor Swift. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah metode dokumentasi dan langkah- langkah nya diawali dengan mengunduh video melalui situs resmi kemudian di putar dan di tonton secara berulang ulang. Selanjutnya, memotong setiap adegan untuk menemukan unsur-unsur dari tanda visual yang ditampilkan di dalam video. Kedua, lirik lagu dari video di cari dari situs internet dan dibaca dengan seksama. Ketiga, lirik lagu diklasifikasikan berdasarkan atas jenis–jenis makna. Tulisan ini menggunakan dua teori utama yaitu teori komunikasi visual yang dikemukakan oleh Dyer (1993) untuk mengidentifikasi unsur- unsur dari tanda visual. Teori kedua adalah teori makna oleh Leech ( 1983) digunakan untuk menganalisis jenis –jenis makna dari tanda verbal. Hasil dari penelitian ini menunjukan bahwa unsur-unsur tanda visual mencakup beberapa kategori seperti umur, jenis kelamin, rambut, badan, ukuran, pakaian, tampilan, ekspresi, kontak mata, sikap badan, sentuhan, pergerakan badan, alat peraga, tempat yang ditemukan dalam semua model terkecuali posisi komunikasi yang hanya ditemukan pada model utama. Terdapat tiga jenis makna yang terkandung dalam tanda verbal yaitu makna konseptual, konotatif dan afektif.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of Study</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Language is a spoken or written communication media used by human beings to convey thoughts, ideas, feelings. Foley (1997:27) stated that language is usually defined</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">as a system of signs. The study about a system of signs and the whole thing involving meaning as a part of communication is known as semiotics. Saussure declares semiotics is a science which studies the role of signs as a part of social life and it is also a part of social psychology, and general psychology (Chandler, 2002:2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sign as a part of semiotics takes forms of words, sound, images, object which refer to something else. Generally, the sign can be divided into two parts; they are visual and verbal signs. A visual sign commonly refers to a picture. The verbal sign is associated with the word or phrase which implies meaning. Signs occur in many aspects of daily life, one of them can be found in the music video and its song lyric.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A music video is a short film combining songs and pictures, produced for promotional or artistic purposes. Music video is considered a real view on the content of the song lyrics. The music video itself contains words that make up a song. The music video and its song lyrics are closely related and are used to convey the meaning of a song.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this study, music video and its song lyrics are analyzed entitled &quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">You Belong with Me&quot;</span><span class="font2"> made to be well-known by Taylor swift. The reason for choosing this music video was that such a music video is unique and illustrates two different characters; however, it is played by the same person. Besides, music video and its song lyrics contain visual and verbal signs which are interesting to be analyzed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By knowing visual and verbal signs the music video and its song lyrics contain, understanding the messages of a song conveyed by the song writer will be easier.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>5.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Meanings of Verbal signs in the Song lyrics of the Music Video</span><span class="font2">.</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The meanings of verbal signs with the song lyrics contained were analyzed using the theory proposed by Leech and the lyrics were divided into some parts as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Part One</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset, she's going off about something that you said cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those parts have the conceptual meaning where she felt that the girl was a person who could not understand the personality of her own boyfriend.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Part Two</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">“I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like and she' ll never know your story like I do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first lyrics showed conceptual meaning where she had a daily habit that was typically done. The previous lyric which was supported by the next lyric conveyed conceptual meaning that they differed in terms of preference for something.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Part Three</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">“But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The third part conveyed the conceptual meaning. The first lyric showed a condition in which she realized a significant difference between herself and the girl in dressing. The second part of the lyrics indicated that she knew the girl had a higher position than herself.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Part Four</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">“Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those parts conveyed connotative meaning. In the first part of the lyrics, the word “dreaming” could refer to expectations or desires of the girl. &quot;You wake up&quot; did not mean someone who woke up from his sleep but someone who realized or knew something. In the second part, the words “has been here” were referring to herself who loved him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the analysis above, the elements of visual signs which included some categories such age, gender, hair, body size clothes, look, expression, eye contact, pose, </span><span class="font1">182</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">touch, body movements were found in all models. However, positional communication was only found on the main models. Props and settings were in the music video. There were three types of meanings; they were conceptual meaning, connotative meaning and affective meaning.</span></p>
