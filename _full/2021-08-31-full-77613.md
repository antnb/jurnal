<p><span class="font1">This research was conducted in the West coast of Buleleng Regency with the aim of describing the potential of coastal resources for the welfare of fishing communities. The method used in this research is a survey supported by the observation method. Sampling with purposive sampling technique. Data analysis was carried out using qualitative descriptive analysis techniques and SWOT analysis. The results showed that the West coast resources in Buleleng Regency were in the form of biological resources, namely fishery potential and coral reefs. The potential of these coastal resources can be utilized to improve the welfare of the community through fish farming, coral reef conservation, training to improve tourism services, and providing fish auction sites. The role of other stakeholders such as academics, businessmen,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fisheries in Indonesia involve many stakeholders. The most vital are small fishermen who are the most numerous layer.The coastal area is a potential area that can provide better welfare expectations for the surrounding community who directly depend on coastal activities such as fishermen, fish traders, as well as fish processors and marketers (Agusta, 2014). Buleleng Regency As the regency with the largest area in the province of Bali, reaching 1,365.88 Km2 or 24.23% of the area of Bali Province, it also has marine waters covering an area of Â± 1,166.75 km2 (12 miles) with a beach length of 157.05 Km (Sukraaliawan, 2020) in which there is a diversity of biological and non-biological resources as potentials that can provide carrying capacity for the development of coastal communities (Badaruddin, 2005).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">E-Journal of Cultural Studies </span><span class="font0">DOAJ Indexed (Since 14 Sep 2015) </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">ISSN 2338-2449 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/"><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">The large potential of marine and fisheries in Buleleng, has not been able to provide welfare for fishermen. The conditions of traditional fishermen and labor fishermen still live in a poor condition, giving rise to the irony of the existing potential (Jones, 2015). Such irony is described as the dominance of the problem of poverty in the lives of fishermen exposed to coastal environmental areas that have the potential for wealth and diversity of natural resources (Cahaya, in Ulum and Anggaini, 2020), or also described as dead rats in the rice barn (Satria, 2015). ).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">They live in poverty and socioeconomic pressures rooted in complex interrelated factors (Kusnadi, 2007). These factors can be classified as natural and non-natural factors. Natural factors are related to seasonal fluctuations and the natural structure of village economic resources. Meanwhile, non-natural factors are related to the limited reach of technology, inequality in the profit-sharing system, the absence of social security for workersdefinite work, weak marketing network, malfunctioning of existing fishing cooperatives, and the negative impact of existing fisheries modernization policies (Nawawi, 2009).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Socio-economic changes in coastal villages or fishing villages have clarified the line of social stratification of the community. Labor fishermen have contributed to the accumulation of economic wealth in a small part of the community who own the means of production as well as those who control capital and markets (Sumodiningrat dan Ari Wulandari, 2015). Poverty, social inequalities, and the pressures of life that plague fishermen's households do not allow their family members to be actively involved in social responsibilities outside of substantial life problems for them. The poverty of fishermen in Buleleng Regency has been going on for a long time until now. This can be understood based on a study that was made by the Regional Development Planning Agency (Bappeda) of Buleleng Regency in 2004 in collaboration with the Center for the Study of Socio-Cultural and Environmental Development (PPPSBL) UNIPAS Singaraja (Sukraaliawan, 2020), using the Gini ratio, it shows a larger income inequality, namely 0 .43 in the fishery/fisherman sub-sector compared to income inequality in the food crop farmers sub-sector of 0.20 and 0.25 in the livestock sub-sector (Wahyudi, et al. 2008).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the Gini ratio, it can be interpreted that the people in the fisheries/fishing subsector in Buleleng Regency at that time had the largest income distribution inequality. Or in other words, the fishery/fishermen sub-sector has the lowest income among other farming community groups. This means that non-fishermen's families are more prosperous than</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">fishermen's families. According to Satria (2015), the poverty condition of fishermen in coastal areas is inseparable from the influence of two streams, namely the modernization flow and the structural flow. According to the flow of modernization, fishermen always assume that the problem of fishermen's poverty occurs as a result of cultural factors (laziness), limited capital and technology, limited management, and the condition of natural resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Generally, this type of poverty is referred to as cultural or natural poverty. Therefore, this stream is full of proposals for modernizing fishermen by making cultural changes by increasing technological capacity and improving their business systems. While the structural flow, assumes that fishermen's poverty is caused by external factors. In the understanding of structural flow, fishermen are poor not because of their culture or limited capital, but because external factors that gradually start from micro-village to macro-structural have hampered the process of vertical mobility of fishermen. In micro-villages there is still an asymmetric pattern of patron-client relationships, namely a pattern of surplus transfer relationships from fishermen to patrons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Apart from the contradictions shown by the modernization flow and structural flow, especially those related to cultural factors as the cause of fishermen's poverty, in practice these two streams have hegemonized the lives of fishermen and placed fishermen as a marginal community group both culturally and structurally, so that fishermen experience difficulties. to rise and move forward to realize his equality with other community groups. In the position of fishermen who are so marginalized, a step or effort is needed to help fishermen to be free from the shackles of poverty and also have the ability to improve their quality of life socially, economically, politically and culturally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such factors are often the reason for other parties to negatively assess the social behavior of fishing communities. This perception only preserves the gap in social relations in political relations between the government and fishing communities. In the long term, this is not profitable to encourage the realization of community participation in development. For this reason, it is necessary to reorient the leadership model and development planning targets to be more contextual and participatory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This study uses a qualitative approach. The location of this research is inthe West Coast Region of Buleleng Regency. Types of qualitative data were collected from primary and secondary data sources through observation, in-depth interviews, and document studies. Informants are determined by selection based on criteria, namely the actors directly involved in the theme under study. The researcher became the main instrument in this study which was assisted by supporting instruments, such as interview guidelines and data recording devices, both digital cameras and voice recorder applications on cell phones, and laptops for data storage. Data were analyzed through data reduction, data presentation and verification phases. Interpretation of data in depth and presented descriptively-narratively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">DISCUSSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Poverty and welfare of fishermen. Fisheries in Indonesia involve many stakeholders. The most vital are small fishermen who are the most numerous layer. They live in poverty and socio-economic pressures rooted in complex interrelated factors. These factors can be classified as natural and non-natural factors. Natural factors are related to seasonal fluctuations and the natural structure of village economic resources. Meanwhile, non-natural factors are related to the limited technological reach, inequality in the profit-sharing system, the absence of definite labor social security, weak marketing networks, non-functioning of existing fishing cooperatives, and the negative impact of existing fisheries modernization policies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Involvement or &quot;participation of all members of the community&quot;, from making decisions on development planning, to the implementation and supervision of activities, as well as the utilization of the results by the community is a condition of successful development, for this reason, continuous fertilization efforts are needed for the participation of the community. . The participatory principle is the basis for developing community empowerment, because through participation, the community is expected to have the ability to solve their own problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The synergy between the government and its people is a sine quanon for development, because development is not an activity carried out by the government for its people, but an activity carried out by the government together with all its citizens. In the sense of &quot;government&quot; and &quot;community&quot;, this includes government officials, activists from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), social workers or innovators and community (informal)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Idea of Independence of the West Coast Fishermen of Buleleng</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The condition of coastal and marine resources that are common property with quasiopen access. The term common property refers more to ownership under government control or refers to the nature of the resource which is a public domain, so that the nature of the resource is not without its owner. This means that these resources are not defined in terms of ownership, causing a phenomenon known as dissipated resource rent, namely the loss of resource rents that should be obtained from optimal management.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With the quasi-open access nature of the resources, the actions of one party that harm the other cannot be corrected by the market (market failure). This creates economic inefficiency because all parties will try to exploit resources as much as possible, otherwise the other party will benefit. This is the situation that is currently happening. Supported by technology, parties who are stronger and able to exploit resources excessively so that the law of the jungle occurs (who is stronger, he wins) and natural production power is disrupted. The practice of empowering fishermen is carried out by actors in this case the government, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) through their ability to feel, think, and build a social system which is then realized in the form of policies and plans which are then implemented in the form of programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the development management process, a plan is always aimed at the future towards the ideals or desires to be achieved or realized. In national development planning, it contains ideas or ideas that accommodate the interests and needs of the public, including fishermen. Ideologically and practically these ideas and ideas can represent the interests and goals of the government to empower the community at large. Normatively the representation or presence of fishermen empowerment, in the policy structure of national development planning, can be found in Law No. 17 of 2007 concerning the National Long-Term Development Plan (RPJPN) of 2005-2025, where the national development vision is: &quot;Indonesia independent, advanced, just and prosperous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a policy statement, the development vision contained in the development plan emphasizes the idea of 'national independence'. In this case, 'independence' implies community empowerment from various aspects. Because independence also means being</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">E-Journal of Cultural Studies </span><span class="font0">DOAJ Indexed (Since 14 Sep 2015) </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">ISSN 2338-2449 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/"><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">free or free from conditions or conditions of dependence on other parties. According to Sudjatmiko (Sulaeman et al, 2012: 60) argues that the concept of independence has two perspectives: first, the emphasis is on reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationships in development cooperation, and second, relying more on the ability of their own resources in development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such an idea of independence can be applied to a more limited scope of the program, namely empowering fishermen with the aim of realizing independence, which is independent and free from dependence on other parties. Furthermore, in an effort to realize the vision of the development, it is necessary to formulate a mission that can support the achievement of the existing vision. More clearly it can be stated that a mission can explain the overall goals to be achieved by an organization that provides direction and guidance for decision making in the organization. Sailendra (2015:17) states that the vision and mission must be built in line, because the vision is the hope that the organization wants to achieve while the mission is the method or strategy that must be taken to achieve these expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;Wisdom as a tactic and strategy that is directed to achieve a goal. Therefore, a policy contains 3 (three) elements, namely: (1) Identification of the objectives to be achieved;</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tactics or strategies of various steps to achieve the desired goal; (3) Provision of various inputs to enable the actual implementation of tactics or strategiesâ.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate Technology for Utilization of Coastal Resources</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The increasing competition in the use of marine and coastal resources requires the community to maximize their production. One way that is used is the use of technology. The limited knowledge and ability in using this technology is one of the obstacles and triggers for the exploitation of resources that damage the sustainable potential and have a negative impact on the environment. One example is the use of fish bombs and potassium cyanide to catch types of fish with high economic value in coral reef habitats which have damaged and caused severe environmental pollution. Another example is the gap in the use of technology between large and traditional fishermen which results in the increasing urgency of traditional fishermen in fishing</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The change in mindset in the national development planning policy as stated in the formulation of the national development mission as stated in the 2005-2025 RPJPN above, can also be interpreted as a form of the government's political will in making changes to the development paradigm, namely the government's commitment to give greater attention to greater contribution to the development of the marine sector. And this can be seen from several policies that have been carried out by the government, such as in the field of institutions, since the 1998 reform, the Indonesian government has made institutional arrangements in the field of marine and fisheries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This began with the formation of the Department of Marine and Fisheries Exploration (DELP), then changed to the Department of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (DKP) until now it has become the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (KKP). The same applies to the organizational structure of the local government, where initially the affairs of the marine and fisheries sector were part of the agricultural service or agency, but when an institution was formed that was specifically assigned the task of managing development in the marine and fisheries sector with the nomenclature of the Provincial/Regency Fisheries and Marine Service. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Likewise, in the field of marine economic policy, there was production and reproduction of government policies in several periods of government, namely during the reign of Adurahman Wahid (Gus Dur), DELP launched the Fish Production Increase Program, better known as PROTEKAN. Entering the period of Megawati's administration, the Mina Bahari Gate Program was launched, whose goal is actually the same as Protekan, namely increasing fishery production. During the period of the United Indonesia Cabinet (KIB) volume I, the government again launched a similar program with the name Marine and Fisheries Revitalization which also has the aim of increasing fish production (Nurlinda and Saharuddin, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Through the development mission in the marine sector as described above, it is a guideline for the government to take action to seek and encourage the development and improvement of the management of marine resource potential through increasing and developing the capacity of marine human resources as well as the use of science and technology (IPTEK) in order to improve welfare. community by taking into account the sustainable use of marine resources. Guided by this development mission, the government</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Institutional Strengthening in Maximizing the Utilization of Coastal Resources</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">With the birth of the rules of the game concerning resource ownership rights at the local level, it will indirectly give property rights to local governments. Local governments can manage coastal and marine resources more rationally considering the availability of resources and the degradation of resources will determine the level of prosperity of the people in the area concerned. The fisheries development policy that is implemented should not only pursue economic interests (especially increasing the country's foreign exchange from exports of marine products), but also be balanced proportionally with the commitment to preserve the existing fishery resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition, there must also be a high and consistent commitment in enforcing applicable legal regulations in order to avoid social and economic conflicts. Local wisdom must be accommodated as one of the legal institutions that can minimize conflicts between fishermen. One form of accommodation of this local wisdom is through the preparation of spatial planning for coastal areas. Until now, there are still not many areas and coastal areas that have it so that they do not have the same mission from the various arrangements and policies made for resource management.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In an effort to develop fishing communities, and to overcome an unfavorable condition among fishermen, as well as to advance development potential with better management, a strategy of institutional strengthening in fishing communities is carried out. Through collective institutional strengthening, it is expected to be able to make progress towards the welfare of the fishing community more optimally. Institutions in this sense are not merely institutions or agencies or organizations that have a structure, but also include a set of normative orders in social life in order to achieve certain goals (Permana and Mursitama, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to Hayami and Kikuchi (Odagiri, 2020) institutional is defined as a general device that is adhered to by members of a community. In connection with this, Amanah (2005) stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">E-Journal of Cultural Studies </span><span class="font0">DOAJ Indexed (Since 14 Sep 2015) </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">ISSN 2338-2449 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/"><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;That in principle, the definition of an institution can include a mutual cooperation system, a social and profit-sharing system, and so on, which are collective activities of the community that have complete norms or unwritten rules that are understood and agreed upon by the actors.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A broader definition of institutional is put forward by Soleh (2014: 88) as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Institutions are a form of social relations that have at least four components, namely: 1) the existence of a group of people who can be clearly identified; 2) the existence of goals to be achieved, which makes them cooperate/interact with each other; 3) the existence of rules that are adhered to and bind them in interact / cooperate; 4) the existence of an organizational structure, where everyone has a position and role that they must carry out according to predetermined rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The formation of fishermen's organizations at the local level which are formed independently or through the initiation of community empowerment programs from the government in the form of better organized groups, is the beginning of action to make fishing communities more empowered. The practice of empowering fishermen through strengthening fishermen's institutions is implemented through strengthening the capacity of fishermen's organizations in coastal areas. Strengthening fishermen's institutions through increasing the capacity of fishermen's organizations carried out by agents in the form of providing guidance, education and training to people within the organization as one of the organizational elements, is essentially an agent's action directed at efforts to improve and improve the quality of human resources of fishermen's organizations itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Efforts to empower fishermen through institutional strengthening in the West Coast Region of Buleleng Regency, in addition to the organizational and management coaching and training as mentioned above, are also carried out by providing institutional facilities that allow the growth and development of dynamic fishing community participation in fishing groups. Here, some groups of fishermen have been provided with the assistance of group hall facilities by the government, which by the fishing groups can function as meeting halls. This group center facility is important in realizing the strengthening of fishermen's institutions, because this can foster togetherness and improve the fishermen's democratic process at the group level.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/"><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fishing community either regularly every month or incidentally can hold a meeting agenda, some based on certain dates every month, or based on certain days gathering at the Group Hall to discuss problems faced by fishermen, such as those related to fishing technology, business or financial capital as well as processing and marketing of the catch. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 show the existence of Balai Group which is used by fishermen as a place for routine and incidental meetings.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/77613-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:212pt;height:114pt;">

<p><span class="font1">Helping activities, limited personnel assistance and financial assistance and the aim of strengthening traditions can be a characteristic of the seka (Astika, 2021) and this has very important meaning in the context of strengthening fishermen's institutions.

<p><span class="font1">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the implementation of coastal and marine resource management aimed at empowering the socio-economic community, the community should have great power to regulate itself in the management of coastal and marine resources in this era of autonomy. The process of transferring authority from the government to the community must be realized. However, there are several things that are still the responsibility of the government, such as the matter of resource fiscal policy, the development of facilities and infrastructure, the preparation of coastal spatial planning, as well as legal instruments for resource management. Although this is part of the government's authority, it does not mean that the community does not have contribution and participation in every policy formulation. With the contribution and participation of the community, the formulated policy will be more touching on the real issue and will not harm the public interest.</span></p>
