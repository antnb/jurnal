<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>ABSTRACT</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">The study discusses the meanings of 'to eat' in Balinese. It aims to describe the application of the theory of Natural Semantics Metalanguage (NSM) on the Balinese language verb, which means ' to eat'. The theory used to analyze the verb is the theory of Natural Semantics Metalanguage. The theory recognizes the principle that the natural state of a language is to maintain the form for one meaning and one meaning for one form. The study uses two types of data sources, namely: (1) primary data in the form of oral data and (2) secondary data in the form of written data related to the research topic. The method used in data collection is observation and conversation. Results of the data analysis are presented by using formal and informal methods. These results indicate that the verb “to eat” in Balinese language consists of: lexicons of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ngrayunang, ngajeng, daar, nunas, nede, ngamah, nidik, nyaplok, caklok, ngleklek, </span><span class="font1">dan </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nyanggol</span><span class="font1">. Such lexicons, in addition to having the same semantic field, they also have distinctive features that differentiate one lexicon to the others.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">One of the few general rules of semantic mentions that the different forms will be different in meaning (Chaer, 1990: 39). That is, if there are two or more words that look different although the difference is slight, its meaning is different. Therefore, two synonymous words are not exactly one hundred percent have the same meaning. There is definitely a difference. It can be proved on the words </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">kini</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">sekarang</span><span class="font1">. Both words are essentially synonymous, but in reality are not interchangeable in a sentence. The word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">sekarang</span><span class="font1"> in the sentence, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Istri yang sekarang cantik”</span><span class="font1"> &quot;&nbsp;it cannot be replaced with the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">kini</span><span class="font1"> because sentence construction that appears to be, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Istri yang kini cantik</span><span class="font1">” (not grammatical).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The statement was supported by the proponents of the theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) who believes in the principle that the natural conditions of a language is to maintain the form for one meaning and one meaning for one form (Wierzbicha, 1996). The principles, in addition to be applied to the grammatical construction, it is also applied to the lexical construction. The description can be seen in the following data.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(1)</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imeme sedek madaar di paon</span><span class="font1">.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">'Mother is eating in the kitchen'</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(2)</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ida Bagus kari ngrayunang</span><span class="font1">.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">‘Ida Bagus is still eating’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Data (1) and (2) show that the lexical forms are different, especially lexicon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">madaar</span><span class="font1"> on data (1) and lexicon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ngrayunang</span><span class="font1"> on the data (2). Such differences in accordance with the opinion of Goddard (2002: 130) that special semantic features called subtle difference, is inherent in some lexicons that have shaped configuration of distinctive meaning between the one lexicon to the other lexicons, especially the lexicon that is in the same semantic field, such as lexicon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">madaar </span><span class="font1">which is classified as low Balinese language, while </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ngrayunang</span><span class="font1"> is classified as polite Balinese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although these two words refer to the same reference, the two lexicons have components of meaning, which is not one hundred percent the same. According to Palmer components of meaning is the whole meaning of a word composed of a number of elements in which the</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">elements of one another have different characteristics (1981: 108). It can be proved by the two lexicons that cannot be exchangeable in the sentence. If imposed, the sentence will be as follows. (3) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">* Imeme sedek ngerayunang di paon</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">'Mother is eating in the kitchen'</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(4) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">* Ida Bagus kari madaar</span><span class="font1">.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">‘Ida Bagus is still eating’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The two sentences, namely: (3) and (4) are not acceptable in the Balinese speech community for breaking the speech ethics. The linguistic phenomeon is very interesting to be studied more in depth in order to obtain a more complete description of the application of the theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) in the Balinese language verb meaning 'to eat'.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical Basis</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The theory used to analyze Balinese verb of 'to eat' is the theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM), which combines the philosophical traditions, the logic in the study of semantics, with the approach of typology on the language studies based on empirical research across languages (Wierzbicha, 1996: 23) and it is expected to provide an overview of the semantic structure. Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is: (1) a theory that can be used to explicate the meaning of the verb </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">madaar</span><span class="font1"> 'to eat' in Balinese, (2) the theory of NSM recognizes the principle that the natural conditions of a language is to maintain the form for one meaning and one meaning for one form, and (3) in theory of NSM explication of meaning is framed in a metalanguage originating from natural language.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Wierzbicka (1996: 23) and Beratha (2000: 248) argue that the NSM analysis techniques using paraphrase that follows the following rules.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paraphrasing should use a combination of a number of original meaning proposed by Wierzbicha. The combination of a number of the original meaning is required, related to the</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">claims of the theory of NSM, a form cannot be deciphered only by using a single original meaning.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paraphrasing can also be done using the elements that constitute the distinctiveness of a language. This can be done by combining elements that constitute the uniqueness of the language itself to decipher.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paraphrasing sentence must follow the rules of syntax of the language used to paraphrase.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paraphrasing always use simple language.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paraphrasing sentences sometimes require special indentation and spacing. Example: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">madaar</span><span class="font1"> 'to eat'</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">At that time, X does something to Y. Therefore, Y moves to the X. At the same time X wants this. X does something.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This study uses two types of data sources, namely (1) the primary data i.e. oral data and (2) secondary data in the form of written data in relation to the research topic. Primary data is the main data in this study. Secondary data is an indispensable source of data. Secondary data serves to reinforce the primary data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The methods used in the data collection were listening and conversation (Sudaryanto, 1993: 133). The listening method can be equated with the method of observation, meanwhile conversation methods can be equated with the interview method. Observation methods in its operation can be assisted with uninvolved observation conversation techniques and note-taking. With uninvolved observation conversation techniques, data can be collected through observation of non-participatory nature. That is to say, the researcher does not engage in verbal interaction with the research subjects. Note-taking techniques used in data collection in order to be more efficient because it only records the discourse in which there are forms of verbs of Balinese language.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In addition to the method of observation, data collection also used interview method. This interview method in its implementation was aided by face to face interview techniques and notetaking. A method of conversation is equated with the interview method, which in practice trying to approach the atmosphere of intimacy, to get openly verbal interaction between researcher and informants. Nevertheless, the observation method was the most important of the two methods used in data collection, because it is intended to obtain empirical data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To analyze the data regarding the verbs of Balinese language, particularly with respect to the meaning of 'eating', then it was used the theory of Natural Semantics Metalanguage (NSM). The theory recognizes a principle that the natural state of a language is to maintain the form for one meaning and one meaning for one form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Results of the data analysis are presented using informal and formal methods. Informal methods are realized in the forms of verbal word with some technical terms in the field of Balinese verbs. Formal methods are used also as a complement of informal methods. In this case the formal method is realized in the form of symbols / signs, such as: ‘...’, “...”, x..., y...</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Hierarchically Balinese system is based on lineage. Balinese community system is known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wangs</span><span class="font1">a or castes (Wiana, 1993: 21). Brahmins, known as the highest caste, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ksatria</span><span class="font1"> is the second caste, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vaishya</span><span class="font1"> as the third caste. The third caste is grouped into </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">triwangsa</span><span class="font1"> groups. The fourth caste is known as common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Relating to the social strata of the Balinese society, than it emerges a stratified Balinese language systems. The Balinese stratified language system known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sor singgih basa</span><span class="font1"> which is basically the polite and the folk language in use (the research team of the Faculty of Letters, 1978/1978: 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The usage of sor </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">singgih basa</span><span class="font1"> is traditionally deemed to have good speaking manners when talking to a higher caste (Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya) by using polite Balinese language (cf.

<p><span class="font1">As a result of the use of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sor singgih basa</span><span class="font1">, the concept of </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">to eat</span><span class="font1"> is expressed by a number of lexicon in the Balinese language, such as: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ngrayunang, ngajeng, daar, nunas, nede, ngamah, nidik, nyaplok, caklok, ngleklek,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nyanggol</span><span class="font1">. However, this study does not make the problem of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sor-singgih basa</span><span class="font1"> as the main problem. The corpus of data that can be studied, remain rooted in the assumption that the semantic structure of the lexicons in Balinese language verbs have a variety of forms and have the same semantic field. Harimurti (1982) mentions that the semantic field is part of a semantic system of language, which illustrates a part of the reality in the field of culture or a particular universe which is realized by a set of lexical items related meaning. Semantic field theory is related to the theory that the vocabulary of a language has a field structure, both lexical and conceptual structure can be analyzed in synchronic, diachronic, as well as paradigmatic approach (Aminuddin, 1988: 108).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Lexicon of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ngrayunang</span><span class="font1"> has the same semantic field as the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">madaar</span><span class="font1">. That is, the two words are in essence a speech act verbs, with the referents move the object to the upper body, the mouth; the object then chewed and swallowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although these two words have the same semantic field, each has certain semantic features which are different from one another. The most dominant semantic features differentiate between one lexicon with the other, is the relationship of these words with the agents / actors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the lexicon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">madaar</span><span class="font1"> intended in most people, the lexicon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ngajeng</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ngrayunang</span><span class="font1"> are words of respect for dialogue partner or the person to whom being talked about.

<p><span class="font1">Therefore, Y to X body part (agent).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">X wants something.</span></p>

That is, verbs that require object, but in this sentence, there is no object. This happens because the dialogue partner has understood that what is eaten by the agent / actor is rice. Sentence (6) B in Balinese is essentially the same as the equivalent sentence in Indonesian, such as &quot;Have you eaten, sir?&quot; It means, he is eating rice. The verb”eat” on the sentence can be classified as active transitive verb of speech act.

<p><span class="font1">According to Ullman, there are some elements of the cause of polysemy. A number of these elements include: (1) the specification in science, for example, the word “form” in the field of linguistics, architecture, and art has its own meaning, (2) specialization use in social life diverse community so that the word &quot;jalan&quot; by the driver means working, by traders is interpreted as “sold”, while in relation to meeting is defined as “take place”, (3) used in the style of language, for example, a poem that the word “blood” and “frozen” in the stanza of poetry by Chairil, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Nanti darahku jadi beku</span><span class="font1"> has experienced displacement of meaning, and (4) mistakes in oral speech and in writing, the construction of </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">ke lapangan</span><span class="font1"> may be able to contain the meaning of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">sesuatu yang lapang</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">pergi ke lapangan</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The meaning of 'to eat' can be expressed in different forms of lexicon in Balinese language. Nevertheless, the principle of MSA which maintains one form one meaning, and one meaning with one for.m For example, the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">madaar</span><span class="font1"> 'to eat' is obviously just focused on putting something into mouth, chewed, and swallowed. It is not likely to occur in other body parts. In other words, each lexicon in the Balinese, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ngrayunang, ngajeng, daar, nunas, nede, ngamah, nidik, nyaplok, caklok, ngleklek,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nyanggol</span><span class="font1"> has the distinctive feature that distinguishes between a lexicon with another lexicon.</span></p>
