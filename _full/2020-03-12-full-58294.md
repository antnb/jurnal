Banana stems have the potential as a source of feed because of its high rate of production but it is easily spoiled due to it containing high level of water content Because of this it is necessary to use alternatives process such as silage The purpose of this study is to identify the adequate level of Clitoria ternatea addition into banana stem silage that was measured through in vitro digestibility The silage was created at the Universitas Udayana Faculty of
