<p><span class="font3">This study explored the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> spoken-text tradition </span><span class="font4">of </span><span class="font3">the Sasak people in Lombok. The tradition was used as media for preaching on Islamic day, customs and ceremonies, as well as appreciating the folk literature. Malay literary texts that contained religious values </span><span class="font4">were articulated </span><span class="font3">continuously in various social discourses by </span><span class="font4">the </span><span class="font3">community that owned this tradition. The impact of the globalization and the inclusion of various Islamic doctrines in Lombok have threatened </span><span class="font4">the existence of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition and now most Sasak people especially the younger ones are not interested in this tradition. The background explained above has become the main reason why this study was conducted. Moreover, there were still a few studies which had investigated the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition in-depth. This present study was focused on the history, structure, function, meaning, and articulation of the religious values and social discourse of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font4"> tradition by</span><span class="font3">Sasak people.

<p><span class="font3">The results of this study showed that the historical development </span><span class="font4">ofthe </span><span class="font3">Sasak</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font4"> tradition was </span><span class="font3">characterized by the emergence of Islam in Lombok. It significantly contributed to the existence </span><span class="font4">of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat.</span><span class="font3"> It was followed by the Islamic Malay literature which was used as </span><span class="font4">the </span><span class="font3">reading material in </span><span class="font4">the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font4"> tradition </span><span class="font3">and the media for learning Islam. The historical development of </span><span class="font4">the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> Sasak was explained in various aspects such as religious, cultural, political, and social aspects. The structure of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text was a form of the articulation in spoken style which involved the characteristics of the narrative structure, which was seen from the narrative, rhythmic, and storytelling style. </span><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font4"> tradition </span><span class="font3">had two functions, namelythe manifest function and latent function, and there was a shifting function. </span><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font3">manifest function of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sasak bakayat</span><span class="font4"> tradition was that it was used as the Islamic preaching media</span><span class="font3">, while the latent function was that it was used as the educational, social, economic, and customs media. The shifting function of the tradition was that it was used as an entertainment that described the function of social identity, local knowledge, and competition activity. Based on the cultural and social context, the tradition implied that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition had historical, political, aesthetic, and social significances. </span><span class="font4">The t</span><span class="font3">ranslation during the performance of the tradition was accompanied with the meaning interpretation or review conveyed in Sasak language. Each performance had new meaning interpretation of the text; the dominant meaning of the text was about the singleness of God, negotiation, ambiguity, and rejection. </span><span class="font4">The a</span><span class="font3">rticulation </span><span class="font4">of the </span><span class="font3">Sasak </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text was a form of new meaning. </span><span class="font4">The a</span><span class="font3">rticulation </span><span class="font4">of the r</span><span class="font3">eligious value and social discourse of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text was about the story of Prophet Joseph </span><span class="font4">made up of </span><span class="font3">the spoken-text form using the typical Sasak song.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> is a tradition of Sasak people in Lombok in a form of reading the saga/poetry by singing (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">menembangkan)</span><span class="font3">, translating and interpreting the text in Sasak language alternately by the singer (pemace) and interpreter (bujangge). This tradition has a long history. From the data, it could be identified that this tradition started approximately in 16th century or in early 17th century and it still continues today (Jamaluddin, 2011: 63-88). The demand to perform this tradition was scarce;the demand was usually made by the</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> was originally used as a medium for converting people to be Islam by mubaliq that came to the Lombok island. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition was originally performed on the anniversary of Islamic holidays (PHBI) as the Prophet's Birthday and Isra 'Mi'raj to remind people of God almighty as well as to introduce the prophet’s contribution to the spread of Islam. As time passed by, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3">was used in some of religiousrituals performed by the Sasak people such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ngurisang</span><span class="font3"> (haircut baby), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">nyiwa</span><span class="font3"> (The 9th day of death celebration), marriage, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">beretes</span><span class="font3"> (7th month celebration of firstborn ), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hajj</span><span class="font3"> celebration, and circumcision ritual. Later on, this tradition continueddeveloping along with the dynamismof the community in various aspects of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> spoken-text tradition in its development was used as the media for appreciatingthe Sasak literature in the spoken-text form. The performer of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat </span><span class="font3">tradition articulated the text in various forms, from the delivery, the translation which was accompanied with interpretation, utilization, as well as the response to and the attitude towards </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3">. The phenomenon of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> is significant to be explored in order to describe its existence in the Sasak community where the majority of the people are Muslims. Nowadays, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition as the spoken-text has not been studied in the form of research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition of Sasak faces the effect of globalization and the influence of the new ideology and doctrine (Islam). Such impacts decreased the support given by the community and the regeneration of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3">Sasak tradition. The negative view from the Islamic puritanical groups toward the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> was that tradition it was considered</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bid’ah</span><span class="font3"> and</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">khurafat</span><span class="font3">, causing the people who performed this tradition to decrease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Ikram (1998: 7) art hikayat </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> passing is less attractive to the young and no visible effort is made to preserve it. The condition is still going on and no rescue effort has been made by the stakeholders.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> , as a cultural practice performed by the Sasak people, is derived from Malay literature, and can still be found to exist in spite of the decrease in the audience in the community of Sasak Muslim majority. Nowadays, the Islam religion learning has been replaced by other media; it has been learnedthrough the electronic media, as well as through the formal and non-formal educational institutions. Therefore, before the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat </span><span class="font3">Sasak tradition loses its function and value, it was necessary to undertake research on this tradition. Moreover, few studies have been conducted about this tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on several reasons explained above, the problems in this study were about the</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> historical development, the structure of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text, the function of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3">, the meaning of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3">, and the articulation of the religious value and social discourse in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition of the Sasak people in Lombok.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition has been in existence since a long time ago, but the research related with this tradition was still limited. Some studies have been conducted on this oraltext of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition. There were three researchers who hadexplored this tradition. They are Ikram (1989), Sapiin (2010), and Acim and Ahyar (2011). However, there had been no specific study which investigated </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> in the form of the oral-text. In addition, there are several studies and writings that discussed the development of the Sasak written literature that can be used as references in this present study. Such studies include some works done by Suastika (1997), Adrian Vickers (2009), and Jamaluddin (2011). Although the results of thestudies which had been conducted on the oral-text tradition are not the same, there is a related study conducted by Darma Putra (2013).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">As there were stilla few studies which had been conducted to explore the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3">spoken-text tradition and the dynamism of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition of the Sasak people, the researcher was encouraged to conduct this present study. It is important to undertake this research as the data and information obtained were more comprehensive in various aspects of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> Sasak tradition development in Lombok as the material of the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The term spoken-text tradition should be distinguished from the term the oral literature. According toHutomo in Sudikan (2001: 14) and Sibarani (2012: 36), the spoken-text tradition can be expressed as the oral tradition from oral literature if it contains aesthetic elements and is delivered with performances. Based on the opinion above, it can be stated that the Sasak </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition is an oral-text tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word “bakayat” is derived from the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kayat</span><span class="font3"> with prefix </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ba-</span><span class="font3"> which means “to do”, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kayat</span><span class="font3"> in-Sasak language has the same meaning as</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hikayat </span><span class="font3">(saga). </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> means an activity of reading the saga. In addition, the other terms such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ngayat, Kayat, nyaer, Koran Kayat</span><span class="font3"> are frequently used which is interpreted as reading the bible </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(the Koran)</span><span class="font3"> by singing it. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> in Sasak language was initially used in the eastern part of Lombok in the beginning of its development. But in the other parts of Lombok </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> is pronounced </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bekayat.</span><span class="font3"> It is a combination of the morpheme</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">be-</span><span class="font3"> andthe morpheme </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">–kayat</span><span class="font3">. The morpheme</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">be-</span><span class="font3"> likely tended to change in the Sasak language into the morpheme </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ng-;</span><span class="font3"> therefore, the term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> is also commonly pronounced as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ngayat</span><span class="font3"> which means reading the saga (Saharudin , 2012: 252).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The term articulation has double meaning, 'articulate' means to say, speaking toward, speech, expression, and so on; while 'be articulated' means to connect the front </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(cab)</span><span class="font3"> with the rear end </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(trailer).</span><span class="font3"> The two parts are connected to each other, but through a special connection it can be disconnected. Therefore, the articulation is a form of connection that can unite two different elements on certain circumstances. It is a relationship that does not need to be determined; it is not absolute and essential all the time (Hall, 1986: 141). </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> Sasak, asa text, contains religious values; it cannot be denied that the text has divinity and spiritual values. The religious value of the text of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> was traced through its relation to the social discourse of the practice of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3">spoken-text tradition</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The terms 'discourse' and 'text' are often confusedly used. Some people think that both terms are the same and are used interchangeably. Discourse and text are used to refer two different orientations of the language. Text is considered the application of some parts of the language which are concerned with the linguistic aspect without being concerned with the communicative situation. Discourse refers to a language use which is analyzed from the perspective of communicative situation (Nunan, 1992: 19). From that perspective, the text is oriented towards the language itself while discourse is concerned with spoken language. From the definition, it can be seen that there is implicit relationship between the writing and the text. If the work of writing is a spoken language (in written form), then the text willbe a discourse (oral) which is transformed into a text form as in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word 'Sasak' is a term for the original name of the tribe or ethnic group that inhabits the Lombok Island. The majority of Sasak people are Muslims. From the anthropological perspective, it is known that there are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Islam waktulima </span><span class="font3">and</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">islamwaktutelu.</span><span class="font3"> The difference is in the implementation of the Shari'ah. The Sasak people in this research are the community of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Islamwaktulima</span><span class="font3"> at MapakDasan village, West Lombok andand BelatungMataram.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In research theories are needed as the requirement to solve some issues in the research. In this present study the theory of articulation, the theory of discourse, the theory of function, and the semiotic theory were used. These theories were used to analyze all the existing problems in the study. The theoryof Articulation developed by Stuart Hall (1986) was used to reveal the form and meaning made bythe performer of Bakayatwho interpreted the text that contain religious values and social discourse. The theory of discourse was used to examine the structure of the text as presented by Gerard Genette (1986: 47). There are five key points namely; order, duration, frequency, mode, and speech. The analysis in this study was focused on speech or the narrative sound. The text of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font2"> tended to utilize several aspects beyond languages, such as: song and how it was translated which affected the storytelling. The function and change in function of the</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font2"> text were analyzed using the function theory developed by Merton (in Kaplan and Manner 1999: 79), which states that there are manifest and latent functions. In addition, the theory of functions proposed by Bascom was also used to analyze the latent function as well as to see a change in its function. To</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">This present study is a qualitative one, which is intended to understand the phenomenon of what is experienced by the research subject. This research was conducted at several locations in the island of Lombok, especially atMapak village. The data source was the performance of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> by the performer of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> and Sasak people. The data were in the form of audio recordings completed with photos, audio and interviews from the informants (actor) and the viewers / listeners. The data in this study were collected through participatory observation, in-depth interview, group discussion which was held before and after the performance as well as documentation</span><span class="font0">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After the data were collected, the data were transcribed and translated into Indonesian before being analyzed interpretatively and qualitatively. The main data included the text of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> discourse performed at the village and its relationship with the context as well as customary and religious rituals performed by the Sasak community as a whole as a nonverbal environmentunderpinning the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> meaning</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font3"> The data were analyzed inductively. The results of the analysis were presented formally and informally.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Based on the analysis in this study, it can be described as follows. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">First,</span><span class="font3"> the historical development of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> Sasak was characterized by the emergence of Islam in Lombok which contributed to the significant meaning of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> existence</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font3"> The development of Islam in Lombok was followed by the work of Islamic literature such as</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Javanese and Malay literary works as the medium for learning Islam in order to strengthen the people’s faith. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> as a spoken-text tradition was created by utilizing the Islamic Malay literature accepted in the Sasak community. It spread through many aspects such as the religious, cultural, political, and social aspects. Such aspectscould not be separated from the historical record of the Sasak people in the time of the existence of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> spoken-text </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The development of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition contributed to the rise of the community fanaticism of the importance of Islamic nuanced art. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> was not only used as a medium for learning Islam and preaching in mosques or schools, but it was used as the ritual in some customs and religious of the Sasak people. Theb</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">akayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition was not available in the forms of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cassette tape, video cassette, VCD / DVD</span><span class="font3"> documented by the local government and was not commercially sold. There was no official group or organized group of performers of this tradition that had permanent members. They gathered before the performance began. The ideology which is intended to purify Islam assumes that this tradition contains old belief and syncretism such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bid’ah</span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">khurafat.</span><span class="font3"> The practice of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition which was considered the spoken-text tradition was no longer relevant to the Islamic teaching in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kafah</span><span class="font3">way. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> in its development had entered the realm beyond tradition; starting from when the local government held </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> competition in the anniversary of a district or a particular national commemoration day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Second,</span><span class="font3"> the structure of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font3"> as a spoken text, had a form of presentation and narrative structure. The form of the presentation of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text was classified based on the usage, reference, and communication channels. The b</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">akayat</span><span class="font3"> text structure, as a narrative text, was the story, as shown by KNY, which consisted of several episodes. In the story, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text was delivered orally in a narrative way as proposed by Gerard Genette (1988: 13-20). The rhythm of the narrative text of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> was delivered through typical song rhythmof </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> and translated into</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sasak</span><span class="font3">by</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pemace,</span><span class="font3"> followed by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cerek</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">nyarup</span><span class="font3"> which described the mood of the performer or readers. The telling style of the story of b</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">akayat</span><span class="font3"> text could be seen from the reader’s mood which was illustrated by the storytelling style as a form of the articulation of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>

The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> Sasak manifest function is the function as the media for preaching Islam, while the latent function is the function as educational media, social media, economic media, and as media for preserving the customs. Such functions were decreasing lately. The change in function was caused by the emergence of new articulation in society towards the cultural practices such as the entertaining function that was related to the social identity, local knowledge, and competition. The change in function which is associated with the local knowledge is shown in the following text.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The quoted text above articulates the saga text from the view of Sasak culture and customs in order to maintain harmony and continuity of the marriage customs which are implemented by the Sasak community. The story teller deliberately conveyed the text in order to makethe good habit in the community implemented continuously to preserve the indigenous culture as a form of local wisdom.</span></p>

They are religious meaning, social, historical, political, and aesthetic meaning. The religious meaning is concerned with the greatness of Allah SWT and as the supreme ruler of the universe and as the source of moral and spiritual strength to preserve the community’s life. The conceptualization of religious preaching in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> has developed into several </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">meanings</span><span class="font3"> among theSasak people. All of these are described in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text of Prophet Joseph through the religious customs and behavior of the character. The character in the story taught social aspects, the history of prophet, how to become a leader from the political aspect, and aesthetic atmosphere when </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> was delivered.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>V CONCLUSION, FINDING AND SUGGESTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the analysis of the historical development, structure, function, meaning, and text articulation of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> Sasak, it can be concluded that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> is the literary spoken-text tradition; it is delivered narratively and becomes the aesthetic media for articulating various social discourses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> as a spoken-text tradition has a long history. In its development the tradition was influenced by the dynamic change taking place in society. The emergence of Islam in Lombok significantly contributed to the meaning for the existence of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat. Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> Sasakwas widely recognized by society, especially the Muslims </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">waktulima</span><span class="font3"> and was used in several traditional and religious rituals. However, the impact of globalization and new Islamic ideologies caused </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> to become a marginalized tradition and to get extinct in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text structures can be classified based on the usage, reference, communicative channels, and the narrative structure. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text structure, as a narrative text, consisted of some episodes. The episodes were presented in accordance with the purposes of the implementation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat.</span><span class="font3"> The structure of the text was seen from the written text of speech or the narrative voice. The storytelling style used a song followed with translation. The structure of the text form such as narrative, the rhythm of the storytelling,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> Sasak the text and characteristics of the Sasak culture social context got mingled and had several functions. The functions included the function as media for religious preaching as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">manifest</span><span class="font3"> function and educational function including the projection system, social media, economic media, media for preserving traditions and customs as the</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">latent</span><span class="font3"> function. The development of the owner of the tradition and external influencescaused </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> to be articulated</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font3"> This led to change in the function of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat,</span><span class="font3"> such as the entertaining function which described the social identity, local knowledge, and competition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The function of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> Sasak in the social and cultural context as well as the study of texts, cultural code, and aesthetics implied that the meaning of the text </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3">cannot be separated fromthe story of Prophet Joseph. This involved religious meaning, social, historical, political, and aesthetic meanings. The religious meaning revealed the greatness of Allah, the Almighty God with all His commandments. The conceptualization of the religious preaching in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> changed into social, historical, political and aesthetic meanings among the Sasak people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The articulation of the religious value and social discourse of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text took place through the understanding of the text which was associated with the ritual performed and gave new meaning to the text. The text was interpreted by showing the dominant meaning of the singleness of God, the meaning of the text </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat negotiations,</span><span class="font3"> the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text ambiguity and the meaning of the text </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> rejection. In addition, there were several pro and cons responses from the Sasak people toward the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> tradition with different arguments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was change in the practice of reading </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> in the last three decades.

<p><span class="font3">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The novelty of</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> function is that it focused more on the change in function that occurred as the articulation of the owner of this tradition. In this present study, it was found that the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">manifest</span><span class="font3"> function was no longer used. The latent function changed because there was rearticulation of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> text</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font3"> The function that changed resulted from the political aspect such as the emergence of entertaining function, competition, local knowledge, and social identity. The function was not based on the original function of this tradition as implied by Bascom and Alan Dundes. Therefore, the analysis on the functions in this study is more comprehensive.</span></p></li>

Since the 1990s, the song began to use the sasak song and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">macapatan</span><span class="font3"> which was commonly used as a form of creativity in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pepaosan</span><span class="font3"> by the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> performer. It made </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> more creative, preserve the local song, closer to its community and young people. Furthermore, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> was also performed in mosques but now the presentation can be found in various places, such as at the houses of Sasak people and on the stage of competition.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Some suggestions related to the present study areas follows. First, the researcher and culture observer should help preserve the spoken-text tradition of Sasak people through various studies. It is gettingextinct. It is expected thatthere is a solution to synchronizing the tradition with globalization and technologyin order to anticipate the extinction. Second,educational institutions as one of the institutions should be responsible for maintaining the continuity of the several cultural practices of Sasak people; they are expected to preserve it through teaching and learning activities at various levels of education. Third, the government and society are expected to participate in preserving the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bakayat</span><span class="font3"> Sasak spoken-text tradition through the implementation of religious customs, competition and parade of spoken-text art. The government can periodically</span></p>
