Extracellular matrix ECM is currently one of the most commonly used scaffolds for tissue engineering procedures Extracellular Matrix ECM can originate from the submucosa of the small intestine or vesica urinaria urinary bladder of a pig The purpose of this study was to determine the suitability and safety level of using pigs vesica urinaria as an extracellular matrix to the process of healing open wounds in white rats and to find out the changes that occur
