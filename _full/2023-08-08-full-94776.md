<p><span class="font4">ABSTRACT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satisfaction and loyalty become a measure of the success of a tourist destination. Electronic word of mouth and destination image are two factors that can affect the satisfaction and loyalty of millennial tourists who visit a tourist destination. The purposes of this study were 1) To analyze the effect of travel vlogs as electronic word of mouth on satisfaction and loyalty of millennial tourists visiting Nusa Penida Island, 2) To analyze the effect of destination image on satisfaction and loyalty of millennial tourists visiting Nusa Penida Island, 3) to analyze the effect of satisfaction on the loyalty of millennial tourists who visit Nusa Penida Island. This research was used quantitative method involving 100 respondents who are millennial tourists visiting Nusa Penida Island. Sampling was done by purposive sampling method and analysis using Structural Equation Model (SEM) with SmartPLS 3.0 software. The results showed that 1) travel vlog as electronic word of mouth had significant effect on satisfaction and destination image had significant effect on satisfaction 2) travel vlog as an electronic word of mouth had significant effect on loyalty and destination image had not significant effect on loyalty, 3) Satisfaction had significant effect on loyalty. Other results showed that 81% of millennial tourists use social media as a source of information about Nusa Penida Island.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Nusa Penida Island area is known to have marine tourism potential with the uniqueness of white sand beaches, very blue and clear sea conditions, the beauty of coral reefs, and there are various types of colorful fish. Nusa Penida Island is one of the tourist destinations that millennial tourists are ogling through social media. Starting</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">with the attractiveness of beauty that is shared through social media in the form of visual photos and videos, Nusa Penida Island is starting to be known by millennial tourists. Ali and Purwandani (2017) mention that the millennial generation are those born between 1980 and 2000, the millennial generation is known as a generation that follows trends in social media, including tourism trends that are developing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The millennial generation grew up in an environment that tends to travel as a social lifestyle trend, when compared to the previous generation, the millennial generation is known as a generation that is active in traveling and adventuring. In line with this rapid technological development, destinations cannot rely solely on traditional marketing approaches (Pitana and Pitanatri, 2016). The millennial generation, which is often referred to as the digital native generation, is closely related to the use of social media to share information by word of mouth or often known as electronic word of mouth. In contrast to Traditional Word of Mouth which is usually delivered directly or face-to-face, E-WOM uses internet media which is usually delivered through social media (Charo et al., 2015).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the most frequently accessed social media is Youtube, quoted from Katadata (2019), the &quot;We Are Social&quot; survey states that Youtube is the most accessed social media, namely 88% of the number of social media users</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in Indonesia in 2019. Tourists Millennials access Youtube to watch video content uploaded by travel vloggers, the video content is commonly known as a travel vlog. Through travel vlogs, millennial tourists get information related to tourist destinations, from the information obtained it will form the expectations or expectations of millennial tourists which will affect the level of satisfaction with a tourist destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The image of a tourism destination is a combination of tourist perceptions and efforts to prepare destinations that have advantages compared to other destinations and meet tourist expectations (Sudiarta, 2012). Realizing a positive destination image is always associated with how to meet the needs and desires of tourists. The growth of a positive destination image certainly affects the satisfaction and loyalty of tourists to a tourist destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this case, tourist satisfaction has a big role in building tourist loyalty, where tourists who feel satisfied after</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">coming to visit will tend to have the possibility to return to visit these destinations in the future and are willing to provide recommendations to others to visit. to Nusa Penida Island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">LITERATURE REVIEW</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Previous Research</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Previous research by Wiranatha, Suryawardani, and Bendesa (2016) entitled &quot;Model of Foreign Tourist Loyalty on Marine Tourism to Vision Bali&quot;. The research sample amounted to 204 people and the sampling technique used accidental sampling. The results of the study were analyzed using Structural Equation Model analysis with the help of the Amos Version 21 software program. The results showed that there was a significant relationship between intrinsic motivational variables and tourist trust, there was a significant relationship between extrinsic motivational variables and tourist satisfaction, satisfaction variables had a significant effect on the loyalty variable, there is a significant relationship between the satisfaction and tourist loyalty variables, there is no significant</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">relationship between the trust and tourist loyalty variables, and there is a strong correlation between the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of foreign tourists in diving tourism attractions in Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Research by Rizal, Rachma and Priyono (2019) entitled &quot;Analysis of the Effect of Electronic word of mouth on Destination Loyalty Mediated by Destination Image and Tourist Satisfaction (Case Study on Paragliding Tourism in Batu City)&quot;. Research respondents are tourists who visit Batu City para-gliding tour with a research sample of 100 people. The results of the study stated: 1) E-Wom has a direct effect on destination image, 2) E-Wom has a direct effect on satisfaction, 3) E-Wom, destination image, and tourist satisfaction have a direct effect on loyalty, 4) E-Wom influence on tourist loyalty by mediating destination image, 5) E-Wom affects tourist loyalty with mediation of satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Research by Chi and Qu (2008) entitled &quot;Examining the structural relationships of Destination Image,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tourist satisfaction and destination loyalty: An integrated approach&quot;. The research respondents were 345 people and the results of the research data were analyzed using Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Model analysis. The results showed that the image of the destination influenced tourist attributes, the image of the destination and tourist attribute influenced satisfaction, tourist at-tribute and satisfaction influenced tourist loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Millennial Generation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Ali and Purwandani (2017), the millennial generation are those born between 1980 and 2000. This generation is a generation that involves technology in all aspects of life. The millennial generation is good friends with technology, where they tend to use social media to find information related to tourist destinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Electronic Word of Mouth</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Charo et al. (2015), electronic word of mouth (e-WOM) is a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">form of online exchange of information and knowledge on social media. The effectiveness of electronic word of mouth is more effective than word of mouth communication in the offline world, because it is easier to use and has a very wide range.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Destination Image</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pitana and Diarta (2009) define the image of a destination as an idea or belief that tourists have about a tourist destination. The image of a tourism destination is a combination of consumer perceptions and businesses from tourist destinations to prepare tourist products that have advantages compared to competitors and can meet the needs and expectations of tourists (Sudiarta, 2012).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tourist Satisfaction</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Day in Tjiptono (2004) consumer satisfaction is a response to the perceived evaluation of expectations and actual performance or perceived benefits after using a product or service. In this study, the value can be</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in the form of feelings felt by tourists when visiting tourist destinations. If the value felt by tourists has reached or exceeded expectations, it can be said that the tourists are satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Loyalty</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Loyalty is a consumer's commitment to a brand, store, or supplier based on a positive attitude and is reflected in consistent purchases (Tjiptono, 2004). Meanwhile, according to Kotler and Keller (2012) loyalty is a measure of consumer attachment to a product that is manifested in the desire to recommend it to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RESEARCH METHODS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This study applies a quantitative approach, the study was conducted to analyze and test the causal relationship between constructs. The cause of the causal relationship is called the exogenous latent variable which in this study is electronic word of mouth (X1) and destination image (X2). The constructs that are affected are called endogenous latent variables which in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">this study are tourist satisfaction (Y1) and tourist loyalty (Y2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The research was conducted in October-November 2020. The research was carried out by distributing questionnaires to respondents, with a research sample of 100 people. The sampling technique in this study was purposive sampling with the criteria of respondents being millennial tourists visiting Nusa Penida Island. To test the causal relationship between constructs using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis with SmartPLS software. In addition, this study also describes the characteristics of the respondents, and the assessment of each indicator of the research variables.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Validity and Reliability Testing Result</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Fornell-Larcker provision in Ghozali (2014) states that for research in the early stages of developing a measurement scale for the outer loading’s indicator value of 0.50 to 0.60 is considered valid. Based on these provisions, it can be said that all research indicators can be declared valid, this is evidenced by all the indicators listed in table 1 having a value of outer loadings &gt;&nbsp;0.50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Meanwhile, to assess discriminant validity is to compare the value of the square root of average variance extracted (AVE) of each</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Data, 2021.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">construct with the correlations between other constructs in the model. If the AVE root value of each construct &gt;&nbsp;the correlation value among constructs in AVE model it can be said that it has valid discriminant validity value. Fornell and Lacker in Ghozali (2014) state that AVE value should greater than 0,50. Based on these provisions, it can be said that all research variables can be declared valid. This is evidenced in table 1 which shows that the entire value of AVE &gt;&nbsp;AVE and the value of AVE is greater than 0.50.</span></p>

But unfortunately, there are still many travel vlogs that have not shown the facts of the overall condition of the destination, such as damaged roads and damaged access to tourist destinations on Nusa Penida Island. Where in this case the travel vloggers should be able to explain the reality of tourist destinations not only regarding the attractiveness of the destination but also must tell the reality of the shortcomings that are still related to the tourist destination.</span></p>

The results showed that the mean value of the IMA3 indicator of 4.30 was the lowest value, which means that tourists have not fully felt comfortable while on the island of Nusa Penida (affective image). Sudiarta (2012) also explained that the image of a destination is always associated with how to understand tourists, how to meet the needs and desires of tourists.

Sudiarta (2012) explained that the image of a destination is always associated with how to understand, fulfill the needs and desires of tourists. In essence, in building a positive image is to build a strategy to achieve tourist satisfaction and have an impact on tourist loyalty. But unfortunately, the theory is not in line with the results of the study, where the results of the study show a significant negative effect, which means that a good image will decrease tourist loyalty (opposite direction).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The image of the Nusa Penida Island destination has a very good average score of 4.52, but considering the lifestyle of the millennial generation is a generation of productive age who</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">likes adventure exploring new destinations. Therefore, after the bucket list to visit Nusa Penida Island has been realized, millennial tourists tend to want to visit other tourist destinations that have never been visited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the results of research and discussion on the Effect of Travel Vlogs as Electronic Word of Mouth and Destination Image on the Satisfaction and Loyalty of Millennial Tourists Who Visit Nusa Penida Island, it can be concluded as follows: (1) The results show that travel vlogs as electronic word of mouth has a significant effect on the satisfaction of millennial tourists visiting Nusa Penida Island and the image of the destination also has a significant effect on the satisfaction of millennial tourists visiting Nusa Penida Island; (2) The results show that travel vlogs as electronic word of mouth has a significant effect on the loyalty of millennial tourists who visit Nusa Penida Island and the image of the destination does not significantly affect the loyalty of millennial tourists who</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">visit Nusa Penida Island; and (3) The results show that millennial tourist satisfaction has a significant effect on the loyalty of millennial tourists visiting Nusa Penida Island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seeing the importance of the role of social media in the tourism industry, it is recommended to the Klungkung Tourism Office to develop the social media Youtube as a digital marketing media in introducing the tourist attraction of Nusa Penida Island. In addition, the Klungkung Tourism Office can also collaborate with Travel Vloggers to create travel vlog video content related to introducing the attractiveness of Nusa Penida Island to attract more attention from tourists to visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the results of the study, it shows that the image of the destination has a significant negative effect on millennial tourist satisfaction and the image of the destination has no significant effect on the loyalty of millennial tourists. When viewed from the lowest mean value on the destination image variables, namely the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">IMA3 indicator (I feel comfortable while in Nusa Penida) with a value of 4.30, the comfort of millennial tourists has not been met. As well as the lowest mean value on the tourist satisfaction variable, namely the SAT4 indicator (I am satisfied with the tourist facilities offered) with a value of 3.85, it appears that millennial tourist satisfaction related to facilities or infrastructure has not been achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Further research needs to look at other aspects that can affect the satisfaction and loyalty of millennial tourists visiting Nusa Penida Island, such aspects as the attractiveness of tourist attractions, facilities, services, and tourist trust. In addition, considering that millennial tourists are always synonymous with the use of social media, further research can also expand the role of electronic word of mouth on the satisfaction and loyalty of millennial tourists visiting Nusa Penida Island as seen from the role of using other social media such as Instagram. and Tiktok.</span></p>
