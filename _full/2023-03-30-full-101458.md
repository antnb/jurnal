<p><span class="font1">Rapid technological development not only has a positive effect on education, the negative impact is given such as lack of movement even in a game on the device. Traditional games that are almost extinct can be preserved for preservation as well as an attraction in educational tourism. The purpose of the study was to understand that the conservation of traditional games as a value of local wisdom can be an educational tourist attraction. This research uses qualitative to uncover the meaning of research results with case study techniques. The results of exploration of traditional game conservation in Kampung Adat Banceuy can be beneficial for education, destinations, and also local culture. Educational tourism not only provides benefits for researchers, but for tourists where recreation can be done while learning directly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The rapid development of science, technology and information certainly brings a lot of positive value but not a little negative impact. One of the technological advances today makes the shift in children's interest to play and socialize with others. Many children prefer to use their time by playing gadgets. This resulted in traditional games that had good value slowly starting to be abandoned. Many possible negative things that children can do through gadgets that are feared can form a less good character such as individualistic attitude and less sensitive to the surroundings. According to Ben (2013:168) tourism should benefit and contribute the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">following: 1) Preservation of culture and customs, 2) Improved public intelligence, 3) Improved health and freshness, 4) Maintenance of natural and environmental resources, 5) Preservation of ancient relics and cultural heritage of the past. The life of villagers who still maintain the values of local wisdom can attract tourists to visit and the existence of tourist villages can be one alternative to offset the development of this shifting trend. Tourists with various motivations travel to tourist villages in order to enjoy people's lives, interact actively in various activities and learn local culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Learning tourism can be viewed as a continuum ranging from general interest learning or exposure while traveling to purposeful learning and travel (Ritchie, Carr and Cooper, 2003). The aim of an</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">educational trip in the rural areas is: to know the life and activity of the farmers, to create a positive image of the agriculture in the eyes of the next generations/ urban resident consumers (Petroman </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font2">, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Kampung adat Banceuy is a village that still maintains the values inherited by its ancestors, its people live in a rural atmosphere that still preserves cultural values including one of which is a traditional game that is still carried out by the children of Kampung Adat Banceuy and can currently be a tourist attraction. With this traditional game, tourists can enjoy the value of culture, nature and participate in various typical traditional games. To find out the various traditional games that have the value of local wisdom and explore the value of local wisdom that becomes a tourist attraction, it is necessary to conduct research with qualitative research method approaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Today many children do not know traditional games as cultural assets in their area and replace them with modern games when many noble values are contained in traditional games such as, responsibility, cooperation, sportsmanship, thoroughness and much more. By visiting Kampung Adat Banceuy, traditional games can be felt to provide experiences and form creativity, high social spirit, and a sense of respect for the environment. In addition, tourist visits, especially children will get entertainment and relaxation and nostalgia (reminiscing about the past) when seeing and participating in traditional fun games. The direct experience of playing traditional games that are still preserved by the natives while enjoying the cultural value of the community and the natural beauty of the countryside can be the first blend of educational tourism that attract children's tourists. Dumouchel (2003) states that outdoor education can increase students' awareness of nature through direct observation. The journey to increase knowledge is not new, but research on this is still a little where the </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">literature has not been focused and is still scattered (Abubakar, Shneikat and Akile Oday, 2014).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Qualitative methods are used in this study so that the identification of cultural communities then understands directly in the activities of the community how they behave (John W Creswell &amp;&nbsp;Creswell, 2018). This study uses case study techniques to uncover the results of research (Ritchie et al., 2005). This case study technique provides researchers with the opportunity to explore research more than once with more than one source of information to understand the individuals and groups that are the object of the study (John W Creswell et al., 2007).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Natural arrangement and sourced from primary data is a technique of data collection in qualitative research. Researchers made Kampung Adat Banceuy, Sanca Village, Subang Regency as a research object to collect data. The data collected consists of several types such as participant observation, interviews, documentation and focus group discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Data collection techniques are done by observing directly to the community or called participation observation (J.W. Creswell, 2017). Therefore, the subject that is used as a source of information to be interviewed is the chairman of Kampung Adat Banceuy, cultural actors, and local people who understand the surrounding culture, in addition to interviews also conducted to tourists on tour. The selection of informants is based on the snowball sampling technique, where the sample will continue until the information obtained is accurate and can answer the results of the study. After various processes are carried out to obtain data, qualitative processes are carried out and then describe the research in the form of descriptions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>RESULTAND DISCUSSION</span></h2>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Results</span><br><br><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Edu-Ecotourism as Character Education Based on the Natural Environment</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the results of this analysis, it is known that there is a potential tourist attraction to be developed through the CBT approach. Three tourist attractions can be developed through the coding process of interview transcripts that researchers have carried out. The following describes the data validity test by comparing the results of observations, interviews, and literature studies. Educational tourism is one of the famous sub-types of tourism in the world today (Rodger. D., 1998). Edu-tourism is any type of program inwhich participants travel to a location either individually or in a group with the primary motive engaging in or having a learning experience. It is comprised of several sub-types including ecotourism, heritage tourism, rural/farm tourism, and student exchanges between educational institutions (Yusof </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font2">, 2011).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Educational tourism conducted in the natural environment can provide a character education. In addition, by utilizing the existing culture in a destination, various values of local wisdom can appear like traditional games that can be utilized. Unfortunately, based on the results of observations for 6 months in Kampung Adat Banceuy, no one has explored the potential value of local wisdom reflected in traditional games owned by the people of Kampung Adat Banceuy. The application of the concept of edu-tourism can provide discourse to increase education awareness through the existence of community communities that still enjoy the value of local wisdom and the natural environment from an early age. The implementation of the edu-tourism concept is believed to be an intrusion in improving the level of education of today's young generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Lam et al., 2011 stated that edu-tourist motivations are widely influenced by the commonality of language, historical or colonial links between the home and host nations, geographic proximity and the accessibility of science and technology-based programs. Seeing this well-maintained natural environment can have an influence on increasing the interest of tourists to travel educationally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nature-based tourism, especially forest tourism is one of the important forms of educational tourism, are includes natural eco-systems, diversification of the local floral and fauna, natural conservation (Bhuiyan </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font2">, 2010). The natural environment that is still maintained naturalness can be used as an open nature library that provides learning materials that include; water, air, energy, and land. Kampung Adat Banceuy has natural wealth that is still maintained, namely having customary forests that store biodiversity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The attraction of natural tourism with eduwisata program can be a medium for the development of talent and environmental education as early as possible in addition to introducing learners to environmental problems, through planting the right perspective and attitude towards nature. So it is expected that they have a high concern for the environment (DUmouchel, 2003).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The potential of biological natural resources and ecosystems needs to be developed and utilized as well as possible for the welfare of the people (Fitriana, 2018). Therefore, Kampung Adat Banceuy as an area that has abundant natural resources needs to be preserved and utilized, in order to achieve prosperity for its people. Then the preservation that has been done can be developed as a sustainable tourist attraction, in addition to recreation can also be used as a different type of education and more fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Syahrir et al., (2019) conveying that the benefits of educational tourism include; 1) Provoke a child's interest in certain things, 2) Add information obtained in school, 3) Real and true experiences experienced directly by children, 4) Insight and knowledge will increase, 5) Increase the child's knowledge and knowledge and add vocabulary for children, 6) Social skills increase, 7) Attitude of appreciating the work and services of others will be embedded, 8) Children are more creative and not passive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Educational tourism provides an excellent role for the education of children's character from an early age, this can be maximized if it combines educational tourism in an open environment. The supportive atmosphere and cultural and life values that are still attached to tourist destinations can provide maximum results for character education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Educational Tourism Patterns as Character Education Media Based on Local Wisdom Values</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Kampung Adat Banceuy still has a large land area so that local children can carry out traditional games without any interference from motor vehicles so that children can play safely. Based on the exploration and analysis conducted, it can be understood that efforts to preserve the value of traditional games in Kampung Adat Banceuy can provide good character value for the local community, and tourists and can provide a pleasant tourist experience through some traditional games.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Through traditional games that contain meaning and the cultivation of social values in each individual's behavior. This is because traditional games that are done together can train interaction and socializing with their peers. In addition, the addition of insights on how to make toys can be used as education for children to increase creativity. Here are some traditional games</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">that can provide education through the values of local wisdom in Kampung Adat Banceuy:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gusur Upih</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">This game is usually done on the ground or fielded using a simple tool that is in the form of a jambé tree or an old betel nut tree that falls to the ground commonly called upih. Gusur upih is often played by boys because it requires strong energy to attract the upih.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The trick to play gusur upih is a group consisting of two or more people depending on the size of the betel nut or jambe and each has a task, one person pulls upih which is usually done by a child who is large and stronger energy and one person or more sits on the back of the upih shedding. The base of the upih is a part that has the width of the game is done on a rather slippery ground where the upih can slide and does not make it difficult for people who pull upih.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Participants of the game are unlimited as long as the tools are available, to add to the excitement of this game made the match by determining the start track and finish line. The group that is declared champion is the group that first reaches the end of the track whose distance has been agreed upon by all participants. Gusur Upih game can train children's ability to try and work hard. In addition, the willingness to do teamwork and sportsmanship.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engklek</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Engklek is one of the interesting games that are often played by children and teenagers in Kampung Adat Banceuy. This game can be played by some people there are no definite conditions. The medium required in engklek game is very simple, before playing all that must be prepared is to form a trajectory drawn tiles. The medium used to draw tiles usually uses precarious pieces or small stones or it can also be with chalk writing. After that prepare a stone</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">blade or precarious piece to be thrown by the player on the drawing of the plot, then the player will jump in accordance with the applicable rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The trajectory of the game is generally made above ground or if you want to clean can be done in the yard of the house. How to play engklek is by throwing stone blades or precarious as their tools on each track, they cross the track by foot tiptoeing every track that has been made, who quickly completes the entire series of games, he has the right to choose one area of the engklek track to be his and only the person who wins the area can step on the track while the other participants should not step on the area. Even if the area hinders their game.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on this engklek game, the education that can be accepted is to train balance and focus when playing. In addition, it can also introduce to math lessons, where there are semicircular images, squares, and rectangles. Training makes strategies and decision-making quickly and precisely when throwing stones.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jajangkungan</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">If you visit Kampung Adat Banceuy in the afternoon many children who play in the yard and also some play in the field. One of the traditional games that are often done is jajangkungan or elsewhere in West Java also many who call it egrang. This game is widely done by children aged 7 (seven) to 13 (thirteen) years even some teenagers and adults also often do it just a fad for entertainment. Not infrequently kindergarten-age children in Kampung Adat Banceuy are also good at playing ja-jangkungan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The game is made of bamboo made of two equal parts Length with each about 2.5 (two commas five) meters to 3 (three) meters. Then make two more pieces of bamboo each about 20 (twenty) cm for footrests. Furthermore, one of the long</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">bamboo segments is perforated to include a short-sized bamboo. After the short-sized bamboo for footrests is installed, then the tallness made of bamboo is ready for use. How to do this game there is played for speed races and there are shootouts to bring down opponents. If playing jajangkungan to complain about speed, then the players are at the start line, if there is already a start then the players will try as quickly as possible by using the curve to the finish line. The player who is declared victorious is the first to get to the finish line. If the game to bring down the opponent, then two players each face off after boarding and there is already aba-aba start then they will drop each other by hitting the opponent's bamboo legs. The player who succeeds in knocking down the opponent is then declared the winner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The game is also often used as a race on Independence Day events on every 17th (seventeen) August or often called Augustan. This game is usually played on a field or a quiet street. Many benefits can be obtained from this jajangkungan game in addition to being seen as a fun, challenging, and not expensive game to make the game tool. The game also trains hard work, tenacity, and sportsmanship. The value of hard work can be reflected in the spirit of the players who try to be winners. The value of tenacity is reflected in the process of making tools that require tenacity so that when used to run the tool is balanced and easy to use. The value of sportsmanship is reflected in honesty and not cheating when playing games and also accepting defeat with airy chest.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gatrik</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Gatrik is one of the traditional games that are still often done by children in Kampung Adat Banceuy because it includes interesting games and is done in groups. The tools used in this game are two pieces of wood, one measuring about 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(thirty) cm and the other measuring shorter measuring approximately 10 (ten) cm. In addition to pieces of wood, two stones are also needed to store short sticks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The game starts by creating two groups then suits to determine which group first gets a turn to play. How to play gatrik is to store small pieces of bamboo between two stones and then hit by a long bamboo stick until the bamboo floats as far as possible so that it cannot be captured by other groups on guard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The team that is on guard trying to catch a short bamboo, if it manages to catch then the members of the group who are getting a turn to play will put a long bamboo on a brick with a transverse position. Then the group of guards would throw a short bamboo towards the long bamboo. If the short bamboo touches the long bamboo, then there is a change of turn to play to the group of guards. If the guard is unable to catch the short bamboo, then the group that is getting a turn to play is entitled to hit back the short bamboo thrown by the guard team.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The batting team will continue to hit several times until one time the hit misses, if it fails then the next person from the group will continue until the last person's turn. Once finished, the opposing group will reward the sling with a benchmark distance from the last small bamboo that is thrown up to the stone where the beginning of the game begins. The further the short bamboo is thrown, the guard team will carry its opponent further and the group of guards will be more tired of carrying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Just like other traditional games this gatrik game provides a number of benefits including being able to train accuracy, dexterity, prudence and solid cooperation. In addition, because it is played in groups, it can train in order to socialize and be able to accept defeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Model of Conservation of Traditional Games as Educational Tourism Containing Local Wisdom Values</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tourist attractions are closely associated with cultural and natural attractions, but the game is a supporting attraction that can further enrich the tourist attraction. Traditional games that can form children's characters can be explored to become educational tourism. In addition to doing traditional games should also be invited to make their own traditional toys, so that tourists get knowledge and experience how to utilize the materials in the surrounding environment into a fun and loaded game containing noble value. Through toys and games, the activities of human life are introduced through all the basic abilities of the body; among others throwing, kicking, hearing, hitting and the like. Such life activities become a medium of knowledge of bodily functions (Alif, Sachari and Sabana, 2015). Play activities have a positive impact in addition to satisfaction can also train themselves in using various body functions owned, so as to create a healthy and fit body, especially for children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For children who do less physical activity by utilizing traditional games the ability to control objects, locomotor abilities and motor skills are low. Traditional games are structured and done well will affect the psychomotor, cognitive and emotional development of the child (Wahidah, Nurlaela and Nafa, 2021). By developing this ability, it will train children's mindset to be more creative and active in exploring things. Playing active games today is rarely found in urban areas, but can still be enjoyed in the countryside. Kampung Adat Banceuy as a tourist village still preserves the traditional game culture that can be used as an attraction for tourists. In addition, children's tourists can travel educationally in this traditional village by enjoying the natural atmosphere that is still beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The use of tourist villages as educational places can provide inspiration to educators to create effective and interesting learning for students. This research has resulted in a model as follows:</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/101458-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:206pt;height:92pt;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Figure 1</span><span class="font2">. Traditional Game Conservation Model as An Educational Tourism Containing Local Wisdom Values</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Educational tourism through traditional games is considered quite effective, through 3 stages, among others; 1) Making games, traditional toys are usually made by natural materials that exist in nature that are then utilized by the surrounding community, by knowing how to make games then children will be trained to think quickly and high spirits to find materials in nature, 2) Knowing the rules of the game, toys that have been made should also be made rules, with the rules children will be trained to sportive in playing and avoid cheating, 3) Activities in the game, children who have made toys and understand how to play then move according to the tools and rules, in this case various games have different benefits depending on the game played.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Traditional games are generally an expression of indigenous culture that contributes to the identity of humanity has been much lost, and even if there are still endangered due to the influence of globalization and harmonization of the diversity of the world's sporting heritage (Boro, Dai-mary and Narzaree, 2015). Therefore, the creation of a narrative about traditional game playing activities can be done as a conservation effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Traditional games must be preserved because of the nation's culture and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ancestral heritage that is full of meaning and benefits that can be obtained from such traditional games. As good citizens we should preserve the traditional game to maintain its existence. Traditional games are not just games, but there are cultural values and elements attached to them. In Indonesia, every region has a traditional game that has the characteristics and deep meaning of the game. Socialization of traditional games and narrative making of the game must often be done in an effort to preserve the culture that characterizes the region in Indonesia.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Discussion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Children's basic abilities need to be developed and realized through positive activities, namely playing and learning, so that play activities are a need for great curiosity to learn both sensoryly, motorly, socially, and intellectually. Children will get the full opportunity to play and learn in a way that is directed to the positive goal of developing active ability towards creative in aspects of personal development as well as a sense of moral and social responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tourism that has a very profitable educational concept for the education and development of children can learn while recreation and gain new knowledge. Children's educational and recreational rides are said to be good if they can make children themselves, comfortable and safe, comfort is meant when the child is happy when playing and learning and feels at home and has a sense of satisfaction, while security is meant by using materials that consider safety and environmentally friendly so that it will not harm the child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Educational tourism becomes an activity that has the purpose of learning while playing, education is delivered through educational programs and seeks to change cognitive, participatory knowledge of learners, skills, and behaviors. Through</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">this tour, tourists can travel to the location and connect directly with tourism while getting a learning experience (Bhuiyan </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font2">, 2010).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Advances in technology provide convenience for some parties, but also have a negative impact on the development of children who use devices. The lack of motor movement of children in using gadgets, can be overcome by educational tourism in Kampung Adat Banceuy which still maintains many traditional games with benefits. Traditional games contain noble values, such as the value of life, cooperation, empathy, hard work, and many other interesting things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The preservation of traditional Sun-danese games that provide many life lessons to children can be supported by the Village by holding special exhibitions and then displaying traditional games. An inventory of all traditional games owned along with rules and how to play them can be written so that they can be maintained for generations to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The development of educational tourism needs to go through an optimal promotion process, especially through various media with the aim of being millennials. Promotions must be spread in various media with high intensity spread and active spread massively. Increased innovation in attractions by adding attraction so that tourists can visit eduwisata which has many variations of activities such as traditional games and feeding of farm animals. In addition, different types of plants can be offered for planting and harvesting packages to tourists.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In conclusion, children's development and learning can be effectively fostered through positive activities such as playing and learning. By providing ample opportunities for children to engage in play and directed learning, their sensory, motor, social, and intellectual abilities can be fully realized. This approach not only promotes their active and creative development but also instills a sense of personal growth, moral values, and social responsibility. Additionally, educational tourism offers a profitable concept for children's education and development, allowing them to learn while enjoying recreational activities and gaining new knowledge. It is essential to create educational and recreational environments that prioritize children's comfort and safety, using materials that are both child-friendly and environmentally sustainable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Furthermore, technological advancements, although convenient, can have negative effects on children's development when excessive device usage limits their motor movements. However, educational tourism, such as the one offered in Kampung Adat Banceuy, provides a solution by preserving traditional games that contain valuable life lessons. These games</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">promote important values like cooperation, empathy, and hard work, addressing the drawbacks of excessive gadget use. To ensure the preservation of traditional games, the village can organize special exhibitions and document the rules and instructions for each game, ensuring their continuity for future generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To facilitate the growth of educational tourism, a comprehensive promotion process is crucial, particularly targeting millennials through various media channels. Intensive and extensive promotion efforts will raise awareness and attract more tourists to visit eduwisata sites. Continuous innovation in attractions, such as incorporating traditional games and animal feeding experiences, can enhance the diversity of activities available for visitors. Moreover, offering packages for planting and harvesting different types of plants can provide unique and engaging experiences for tourists. By implementing these strategies, educational tourism can flourish and contribute to the holistic development of children while promoting cultural heritage and environmental sustainability.</span></p>
