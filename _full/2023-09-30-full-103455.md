<p><span class="font2">This study aimed to develop processed cracker products made from brown rice flour dregs. This research was experimental research. Based on the experimental results, brown rice tea dregs can be developed into three types of crackers that have different colors, aromas, tastes, textures &amp;&nbsp;crispness, and shapes. Crackers were produced using the same method but with the addition of different ingredients; crackers A used wheat flour, crackers B used tapioca flour, and crackers C used brown rice flour. The organoleptic test involved 62 respondents who were asked to provide an assessment of the crackers produced. Based on the organoleptic test, it can be seen that in terms of texture and crunchiness, people liked crackers C the most, in terms of taste the people also liked crackers C the most, in terms of color the people liked the color of crackers B the most, in terms of smell the people liked the aroma of crackers C the most, and in terms of form, the community liked cracker B the most.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Currently, Indonesian people are starting to switch to other sources of carbohydrates which have a more complete nutritional content than white rice or white rice. Indonesia is a country that produces a substitute for white rice or white rice, namely brown rice. Brown rice has a fiber level of 1.6%, while white rice has a fiber level of 0.56% (Hernawan &amp;&nbsp;Meylani, 2016). In addition, brown rice bran has also been shown to contain natural oils and essential fats (Antika et al., 2018). The nutritional content of brown rice which is better than white rice causes brown rice to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">recommended for consumption by diabetics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although brown rice has high fiber and nutrient content, it is not very popular among community. Based on preliminary observations, people do not like brown rice because of the taste and price. The firmer taste and texture of brown rice is different from the softer taste and texture of white rice. That is why people not to like brown rice. In addition, brown rice is also sold at a higher price than the selling price of white rice. Reporting from </span><a href="http://www.harga.web.id"><span class="font3">www.harga.web.id</span></a><span class="font3"> the cheapest brown rice price is Rp. 18,000/ kg while the price of white rice per kilogram is Rp. 12,500. The price factor is a consideration for the</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">community in deciding household rice consumption (Dewi &amp;&nbsp;Hayati, 2021).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Putra (2014) stated that Bali is an organic brown rice producing area, precisely in the Jatiluwih area. Jatiluwih brown rice is produced from the Oryza Sativa Barac Canana Jatiluwih rice variety which is grown organically without any chemical elements. Not using pesticides and the color, smell and taste of brown rice are very distinctive and different, making this brown rice a priority product. Jatiluwih rice has a relatively long maintenance period of around 145 days. At that time, farmers planted hybrid rice to secondary crops. After being harvested, Jatiluwih brown rice is usually stored in the rice barn. This rice is used for personal consumption, to stock up on seeds for the next planting season, and to sell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Apart from being consumed in the household and sold, brown rice around Jatiluwih is also processed into other products. One of them is the processing of brown rice into tea (Noviyanti &amp;&nbsp;Bhega-wati, 2019). The rice tea product that is produced is one of the priority products and souvenir products from the Jatiluwih area. Brown rice in Jatiluwih is also used as a cake ingredient, namely Lak-Lak, but this cake only lasts less than six hours. Since the cakes cannot be stored for longer time, the Lak-lak cake cannot be brought by visitors and cannot be stored for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Seeing the huge potential of brown rice to be processed into other excellent products, the researchers wanted to develop a processed product in the form of crackers made from rice tea dregs which were served when there were visitors in Jatiluwih. Crackers are one of the complementary foods and snacks that are familiar in the daily lives of Indonesian people. In addition, crackers can be stored for a longer period, especially raw or unprocessed crackers so visitors can buy and bring brown rice crackers to their region or country of origin. Residents around Jati-luwih can also process these crackers later </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font2">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font3">as a side dish for the main meal. The use of brown rice tea dregs is intended to optimize red rice tea dregs which still contains fiber and nutrients so that the dregs generated from brown rice tea can be minimized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the description of research background, generally the objective of this research was creating innovative products using Jatiluwih brown rice dregs to give added value to Jatiluwih brown rice. Moreover, the specific objectives of this research are as follows: (a) Developing innovative Jatiluwih brown rice crackers using Jatiluwih brown rice dregs; (b) Analyzing the level of community’s favorite due to the crackers produced in the research by doing organoleptic test.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>LITERATURE REVIEW</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This research was based on two major theories, namely the theory of cracker processing and the Culinary Product Development Model by Harrington (2004). The theory of cracker processing consists of diversification of crackers and the process of making crackers while the Culinary Product Development Model by Harrington (2004) explains procedures for carrying out or developing innovations in the culinary world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Crackers (Crackers) are snacks made from tapioca flour dough mixed with seasonings such as shrimp or fish. Kerupuk are made by steaming the dough before it is cut into thin pieces, dried in the sun, and fried in plenty of cooking oil. Crackers have a crunchy texture and are often used as a complement to various foods. The composition of the cracker ingredients and their processing will greatly affect the quality of the crackers, where the composition of these ingredients also affects the development of the crackers. In general, the raw material used is tapioca flour, while the additional ingredients can be fish or shrimp, eggs or milk, salt, sugar, water, and seasonings consisting of shallots, garlic, coriander and so on (Herman, 2005). Crackers are defined as a type of dry food </span><span class="font2">176 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e-ISSN 2407-392X. p-ISSN 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">made from ingredients that contain high levels of starch. In the process of making crackers, the starch must undergo a gelatinization process due to the addition of water and the heating treatment of the dough that is formed. The dough is made by mixing the main ingredients and the additional ingredients which are stirred until a tough and homogeneous dough is obtained (Wi-jandi et al., in Santoso, 2008). According to Rohhaendi (2009), crackers are a type of dry food that contains high levels of starch because they are generally made from tapioca. Crackers known to the public can be divided into two types, namely crackers with protein and crackers without protein. Furthermore, Purwanti (2011) diversified crackers from the approach of basic ingredients, price, taste, shape, and additional basic ingredients.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diversification of crackers in terms of the type of basic ingredients</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">There are two materials used in the manufacture of crackers, namely raw materials, and additional materials. The ingredients used in making crackers include tapioca flour, wheat flour and rice. These materials can function as raw materials or additional materials, depending on the manufacturing technique. Additional ingredients can come from animals or plants. Examples of animal crackers: prawn crackers, mackerel crackers, milk crackers, cheese crackers. Examples of vegetable crackers: soybean crackers, wheat crackers, tapioca crackers of various shapes and colors.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diversification of crackers in terms of taste</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The various flavors of these crackers have motivated cracker manufacturers to create new types of crackers. If there are crackers with new shapes and flavors, consumers tend to try them. If it tastes good and suits the consumer's tongue, we can be sure they will be interested in buying it again.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diversification of crackers in terms of price</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The price of crackers in the community varies. These varying prices are influenced by the materials used, the packaging and the location where the crackers are sold.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diversification of crackers in terms of shape</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Crackers as a snack are widely known to the public, often found in the market in various forms. such as square, rectangular, round oval, semi-circle, star, gut, resembling shells, conch, and roses.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diversify crackers with other ingredients</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Crackers are generally processed using a variety of other ingredients besides the main ingredient. Other ingredients that are often used in making crackers are tapioca flour, wheat flour, brown rice flour, and other types of flour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Making crackers through a series of processes. Maureen, Surjoseputro, and Epriliati (2016) mention seven stages of making crackers. These stages are as follows.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">a. Dough making b. Printing c. steaming d. Cooling e. Cutting f. Drying</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Research on the processing of brown rice into several processed products has been carried out by several researchers. The use of brown rice, especially the processing of brown rice bran in tempeh sausage, was carried out by Kusumastuti &amp;&nbsp;Ayustaningwarno (2013). In that study, brown rice bran was added to tempe sausage. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of adding brown rice bran on nutritional content, antioxidant activity and preference for tempe sausage. The study was conducted using an </span><span class="font2">e-ISSN 2407-392X. p-ISSN 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">experimental method with a completely randomized design with one factor, namely the difference in the percentage of brown rice bran added to tempeh sausage. The percentage of adding brown rice bran was 0%, 2%, 5%, and 10%. Statistical analysis used a one-way ANOVA test followed by the Tukey test. The results showed that the greater the percentage of adding brown rice bran, the levels of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber and antioxidant activity of tempeh sausages increased. The highest levels of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber and antioxidant activity of tempeh sausage were found in tempeh sausage with the addition of 10% bran. However, the greater the percentage of brown rice bran added, the panelists tended to dislike tempeh sausage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ardhianditto, Anandito, Parnanto, &amp;&nbsp;Rahmawati (2013) also conducted a study entitled Study of the Characteristics of Instant Baby Porridge Made from Yellow Millet Flour (Panicum sp) and Red Rice Flour (Orysa nivara) with Natural Ambon Banana Flavor (Musa X paradisiaca L) as ASI Complementary Food (MP-ASI). The purpose of this research was to study sensory properties with parameters of aroma, color, taste, texture and overall and to study physicochemical properties (proximate, antioxidant, color, water absorption, bulk density and solubility). Sensory test results were analyzed by one way ANOVA at a significance level of α = 5%. Then the physicochemical properties were tested, so that the best instant baby porridge formula was obtained. Based on the results of the study, the addition of brown rice flour can increase the nutritional content of the resulting porridge. The sensory test results showed that the sample with the addition of 10% brown rice flour was better than the control according to the panelists. The best formula in terms of sensory, physical and chemical properties is baby porridge with the addition of 10% brown rice.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This study used a quantitative approach. Specifically, this research was conducted using the principles of the experimental method which is laboratory research. This experimental research method was chosen based on the formulation and research objectives. This research was conducted in two places, namely Jatiluwih Village and the Politeknik Internasional Bali campus. Raw materials in the form of brown rice tea dregs were taken from Jati-luwih Village. Formula or recipe trials were carried out at the Politeknik Internasional Bali campus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This study usedquantitative data in the form of recipe formulas and the results of sensory tests and organoleptic tests. The formula or recipe was sourced from experimental tests conducted in the laboratory, namely the kitchen of the Bali International Polytechnic. While the organoleptic test data were obtained from research respondents. Experiments were carried out to produce recipes and formulas using two instruments, namely equipment and raw materials. The following is the equipment and raw materials needed. For the organoleptic test, the researcher used an assessment sheet for the respondents. The assessment component on the organoleptic test only contains the respondent's favorite component. The study involved 62 respondents.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In experiments conducted by researchers to produce innovative processed products using brown rice tea waste, researchers produced three types of crackers. The three types of crackers produced in this study were crackers using wheat flour, crackers using tapioca flour, and crackers using brown rice flour. The three types of crackers are produced through the same process but use different flour. The following is a description of the crackers produced in this study.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingredients and Procedure</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The three types of crackers produced in this study used almost the same ingredients with the same dosage. But the flour used to make crackers was different. Crackers A used wheat flour, crackers B used tapioca flour, and crackers C used brown rice flour. The materials used to produce these crackers are shown in Table 1. These materials are processed through the same process. The following is the procedure for making crackers A, crackers B, and crackers C.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown rice tea dregs are first steamed until cooked.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crackers using wheat flour (A)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Crackers prepared using wheat flour do not have a distinctive or specific aroma. The aroma is the same as other crackers in general and also has the same aroma as the other two types of crackers produced in this study. These crackers are light brown in color. Cracker A has the same shape as cracker C which cannot expand when fried. Kerupuk A has a crunchy texture that is more similar to chips than to kerupuk. However, crackers A have a softer texture compared to chips. There was no difference in taste between the three crackers produced in this study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crackers using tapioca flour (B)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The second cracker is processed using tapioca flour. Similar to crackers A, these crackers using tapioca flour do not have a specific aroma. These crackers tend to have the same aroma as other crackers. Kerupuk B is white with red elements. Unlike crackers A and C, crackers B expand when fried in hot oil. Cracker B is a processed brown rice tea waste cracker which has the same texture as crackers in general </span><span class="font2">179 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e-ISSN 2407-392X. p-ISSN 2541-0857</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Crackers C is processed using brown rice flour. These crackers do not produce a distinctive aroma and have the same taste as crackers A and B. Crackers C also have a crunchy texture and resemble crackers. The texture of cracker C is denser than that of cracker A. Apart from the difference in texture, cracker C also has a difference in terms of color where cracker C has the darkest color among the other two crackers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The different colors among those three crackers is shown in the Figure 2.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/103455-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:208pt;height:117pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the experimental results and data analysis, the following are some conclusions that can be drawn.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown rice tea dregs can be developed into three types of crackers that have different colors, aromas, tastes,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">textures &amp;&nbsp;crunchiness, as well as shapes. Crackers are produced using the same method but with the addition of different ingredients; crackers A use wheat flour, crackers B use tapioca flour, and crackers C use brown rice flour.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the organoleptic test, it can be seen that in terms of texture and crunchiness, people like crackers C the most, in terms of taste the people also like crackers C the most, in terms of color the people like the color of crackers B the most, in terms of smell the people like the aroma of crackers C the most, and in terms of form, the community likes cracker B the most.</span></p></li></ul>
