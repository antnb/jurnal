<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Medicines are the most common form of therapy in society and are an integral part of almost all levels of care<sup>[10]</sup>. This contributes to ease of purchase, promotes selfmedication, and a buildup of medicines in homes. Medicines stored at home (&quot;home pharmacy&quot;) are often purchased over the counter, on the recommendation of a third party and without professional advice<sup>[11]</sup>. The conditions and proper way of storing medicines at home are important aspects of safe and effective drug treatment. Drug storage and distribution are strictly regulated and closely monitored at every stage of the drug supply chain as specified in the guidelines for the Regulation of the Food and Drug Supervisory Agency (BPOM) Number 4 of 2018 concerning Supervision of Drug Management, Medicinal, Narcotics, Psychotropic Substances, and Pharmacy Precursors in Pharmaceutical Service Facilities<sup>[1]</sup>. However, information about the knowledge of patients with appropriate storage conditions, rational drug use, the dangers associated with inappropriate drug use, and the management of various drugs is lacking<sup>[12]</sup>. In addition, there has been a steady increase in the consumption of over-the-counter and prescription drugs. Medicines are purchased with and without a prescription and stored in various places in the home. Some places in the house are not suitable for storing medicine. For example, storing medicine in the bathroom is a common practice. This exposes the drug to humidity and high temperatures, which can accelerate its degradation and shelf life. Even more, exposure to certain drugs to light can lead to photodecomposition and, consequently, loss of potency and efficacy<sup>[12]</sup>. Indiscriminate purchase of medicines, unsuitable storage conditions, exchange of medicines with family members and friends, and irrational use of drugs</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">without medical consultation can all lead to problem health<sup>[6,16]</sup>. In general, improper drug storage contributes to health hazards<sup>[17]</sup>. So that patients are expected to store their medicines at home according to the storage conditions stated in the Product Characteristics Summary, such as in the case of drugs requiring refrigeration or storage in the original (outer) packaging to protect from moisture or light, provided by the drug company in the insert packaging, and on drug packaging. In addition to adequate storage conditions, patients should use drugs before the expiration date and store medicines in undamaged primary packages to ensure drug quality. In addition, adequate storage practices also require that patients have access to drug information by keeping identifiable drugs (e.g. for caregivers) and having a package insert available. Increased knowledge about home storage practices can help pharmacists identify which medicinal products and aspects of home storage require more attention when counselling patients. The objective of this systematic review is to identify and characterize the storage method associated with home-stored pharmaceuticals (the &quot;pharmacy community&quot;). Increased knowledge about home storage practices can help pharmacists identify which medicinal products and aspects of home storage require more attention when counselling patients. The objective of this systematic review is to identify and characterize the storage method associated with home-stored pharmaceuticals (the &quot;pharmacy community&quot;). Increased knowledge about home storage practices can help pharmacists identify which medicinal products and aspects of home storage require more attention when counselling patients. The objective of this systematic review is to identify and characterize the storage method</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">associated with home-stored pharmaceuticals (the &quot;pharmacy community&quot;).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>MATERIAL AND METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">This systematic review analyzes the storage methods for drugs to identify and characterize the storage methods associated with medicines stored at home (the &quot;pharmacy community&quot;).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Study identification</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Writing a systematic review uses a literature study. The literature review procedure used is by searching using online searches through the Google Scholar, WHO, PubMed, and PubMed Central instruments, Science Direct and several other guidelines. The keywords used are public drug storage, community pharmacy, public medicine storage profile, household drug storage, drug storage in the community</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Eligibility Criteria</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Publication restrictions used, namely English and Indonesian, in the last 10 years and obtained through literature that can be considered relevant and reliable include quasi-experiments, descriptive crosssectional designs, and randomized control trials (RCTs). The level of evidence is determined based on the classification issued by the Oxford Center for Evidencebased Medicine Level of Evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All cross-sectional articles, RCTs, experiments that provide study studies on how to store medicines at home (pharmacy community) are downloaded first. The article must contain the storage area for the drug, the type of drug preparation material, the type of medicine being stored, the problems encountered during the storage of the drug, and the purpose for using the drug (for the term or short term according to the disease).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Exclusion criteria are articles that discuss only one type of storage area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Data Extraction and synthesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Data ecstasy was performed by one reviewer using Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word software. First, data extraction is carried out by looking for the characteristics of each article, namely author, country, study design, stored medication, history of chronic diseases, medicine storage, drug storage problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The second extraction is done by looking for statistics from the type of stored medication, history of chronic diseases, medicine storage, drug storage problems and analyzing the influencing factors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Search Result</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This systematic review was conducted in the period February - Mei 2021. The type of study used was a cross-sectional study. Journals used from Google Scholar, WHO, PubMed, and PubMed Central, Science Direct and several other guidelines. They were obtained as many as 20 journals. Those who met the inclusion criteria were 10 journals. Of the 10 journals that had met the inclusion criteria, 3 journals were excluded so that only 7 journals were used in the literature review / systematic review.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Studies Characteristics</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">All articles analyzed were crosssectional studies from 2011 to 2020. The articles included in the study came from several countries such as Gondar Town in northwestern Ethiopia<sup>[13]</sup>, Qatar<sup>[5]</sup>, Dutch<sup>[14]</sup>, Tigray Region Northern Ethiopia<sup>[15]</sup>, Rowan Camden University New Jersey Pediatric ED of a tertiary referral university hospital ED<sup>[8]</sup>, Northern United Arab Emirates<sup>[12]</sup>, and Primary Care Unit city of Divinópolis<sup>[3]</sup>.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>DISCUSSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The storage of medicines in the household is based on several factors, namely the presence of family members who have certain diseases so that they must take drugs in the long term, the presence of health workers, and the education level of family members<sup>[13]</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When storing drugs, it is necessary to examine the location of the expiration date, listen carefully when pharmacists explain drug information and are active in finding out about drug expiration information. Problems that can arise with drug storage conditions are impaired drug stability and can accelerate drug degradation prematurely<sup>[4]</sup>. Disorganized storage of medicines in various places in the household can lead to unintentional non-compliance such as use of drugs without a doctor's prescription, use of antibiotics and drugs together in the family, danger to children's health, rapid degradation. So the storage of medicines in the medicine cabinet and out of reach of children is highly recommended<sup>[12]</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Regarding drug administration, the majority of people in the United Arab Emirates store medicines without being separated and only placed in drawers. Placement of drugs in one place without being separated between those used and for supplies can allow errors in drug use and lead to non-compliance in the form of joint drug use without a prescription<sup>[12]</sup>. Low public awareness about giving special labels causes errors in using drugs so that labelling can make it easier for people to use drugs according to the complaints they face, and labels can minimize the risk of misuse of drugs because the function of drugs is clearly stated on the label<sup>[9]</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The application of drug management in the family includes family roles, responsibilities and expectations, living arrangements, interpersonal relationships, social norms and the presence of financial</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and health-related resources (eg employment status, availability of health insurance). The role of the family and the combination of tasks, equipment and technology can improve the quality of life and avoid the detrimental effects of drug mismanagement and increase safety assurance of drug use<sup>[2]</sup>.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">This study raises relation to medicines stored inside homes that warrant addressing that need pharmacists regarding public education in relation to drug therapy that Goes beyond the dispensing process. They were judging by the finding that pharmacists were not considered primary sources of drug-related information. Good practices should be encouraged through continued health education at health institutions and retail medicine outlets.</span></p>
