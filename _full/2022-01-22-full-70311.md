<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Abstract</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Tax aggressiveness is a strategy of companies to present lower taxable earnings through tax planning without being accused of committing tax fraud, hence considered as one of the weaknesses of the selfassessment system. The purpose of this study was to examine and analyze the effect of corporate governance and political connection on tax aggressiveness with family ownership as the moderator. This research was conducted on manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2016 to 2020. Using purposive sampling method, 49 companies were selected as the sample, resulting in 245 observations. The data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis and moderated regression analysis. This study found that corporate governance does not influence tax aggressiveness, that political connection has a negative effect on tax aggressiveness, and that family ownership does not moderate the influence of corporate governance and political connection on tax aggressiveness.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">As tax are the main source of Indonesia’s income, it is acceptable that the government has made various efforts to increase its revenue </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Hasanah &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Ardini, 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">. One of the efforts is to implement tax reform. Starting from 1983, the reform started from a change from the official-assessment system (tax collection by the tax fiscus) to the self-assessment system. The application of the latter system is expected to be able to fulfill the principle of justice and to simplify the fulfillment of tax obligations. However, it still contains a weakness, namely tax aggressiveness by taxpayers </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Wardani &amp;&nbsp;Nurhayati, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tax aggressiveness is an act of manipulating taxable earnings by presenting lower taxable earnings through tax planning without being accused for committing tax fraud; the legality of the action is still in the grey area </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Wahab, Ariff, Marzuki, &amp;&nbsp;Sanusi, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5">. Indonesia has suffered considerable losses from tax aggressiveness.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Integrity (2019) </span></a><span class="font5">found that in 2016 the Indonesian government lost potential taxes from exportimport transactions of USD 6.5 billion. The Secretary General of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Indonesian Forum for Budget Transparency (FITRA) also emphasized that, as a result of tax aggressiveness, Indonesia experiences tax revenue losses of up to IDR 110 trillion annually </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Himawan, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tax aggressiveness is a conflict between company management as the internal party and the tax fiscus (government) as the external party. This conflict can be explained through the Agency Theory, especially type III</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Pratiwi, Subekti, &amp;&nbsp;Rahman,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. Previous studies have shown that tax aggressiveness can be influenced by diversification of company types </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Zheng, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5">, incentive pay for executives</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Huang,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Ying, &amp;&nbsp;Shen, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">, company characteristics </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(K. S. Dewi &amp;&nbsp;Yasa, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">, political connection </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Putra &amp;&nbsp;Suhardianto, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">, company's ownership structure</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Bimo,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Prasetyo, &amp;&nbsp;Susilandari, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">, and corporate governance</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Kerr, Price, Roman, &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Romney, 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Agency conflicts in companies can be minimized through the implementation of good corporate governance </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Dey, 2008)</span></a><span class="font5">. Tax aggressiveness as a form of agency conflict in companies can also be minimized through the implementation of corporate governance. Corporate governance is defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as procedures and processes related to the implementation and supervision of companies that involve various stakeholders</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (OECD,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2015)</span></a><span class="font5">. The implementation of corporate governance through supervision by all stakeholders is believed to encourage companies to be more compliant with tax regulations or prevent them from carrying out tax aggressiveness </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Kerr et al., 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">. The results of other studies are in fact different; corporate governance cannot minimize tax aggressiveness </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Syamsuddin, Ali, &amp;&nbsp;Sobarsyah, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Political connections owned by companies affect their choices of strategy; one of which is tax aggressiveness. Companies are considered as having political connections if one of the major shareholders or the company's top executives (board of commissioners, board of directors and company secretary) are (a) members of parliament, (b) ministers or heads of state or (c) having close relationships with high-ranking officials </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Faccio, 2006)</span></a><span class="font5">. Companies that are politically connected through shareholders and company boards are believed to be more daring in aggressive tax avoidance </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Sudibyo &amp;&nbsp;Jianfu, 2016)</span></a><span class="font5"> due to lower demands for transparency and stronger connections to government </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(C. Kim &amp;&nbsp;Zhang, 2016)</span></a><span class="font5">. However, other studies have found that political connection can reduce tax aggressiveness </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Lestari &amp;&nbsp;Putri, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5"> for a better corporate image </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Anggraeni, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Companies that implement tax-aggressive activities are those who feel that taxes payment are costs that reduce earnings </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Pratama, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. The choice to implement these activities is also determined by the company's ownership structure. One of the dominant ownership structures in Indonesian companies is family ownership</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Claessens,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Djankov, &amp;&nbsp;Lang, 1999)</span></a><span class="font5">. Companies owned by families are more considerate of the company's reputation, so they are not aggressive in tax </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Mafrolla &amp;&nbsp;D’Amico, 2016)</span></a><span class="font5">. Nevertheless, other studies have different results that family companies tend to do tax aggressiveness for cost saving </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Sunaryo, 2016)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The inconsistencies of the findings above have prompted this study to reexamine the effect of corporate governance and political connection on tax aggressiveness with family ownership as the moderating variable. Inconsistencies in the influence of corporate governance on tax aggressiveness are caused by, one of them,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the method in which corporate governance in previous studies was tested individually using several proxies. This study examines corporate governance comprehensively by referring to the Circular Letter of the Financial Service Authority (SE-OJK) Number 32/SEOJK.04/2015 concerning Guidelines for Public Company Governance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Inconsistencies in the influence of political connection on tax aggressiveness in Indonesia are caused by the method that political connection is studied based on government ownership in companies. This study re-examines the influence of political connection on tax aggressiveness by looking at the political positions held by shareholders and top executives. The assessment of political positions refers to the measurements that are based on the structural positions of civil servants (Pegawai Negeri Sipil – PNS), as carried out by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Supatmi, Sutrisno, Saraswati, &amp;&nbsp;Purnomosidhi</span></a><span class="font5"> (2019).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This study uses family ownership as the moderating variable to find the cause of the said inconsistencies. In the research of </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Landry, Deslandes, &amp;&nbsp;Fortin, 2013)</span></a><span class="font5">, the aforementioned moderating variable is able to strengthen the negative influence of corporate social responsibility on tax aggressiveness. Family ownership can be a moderating variable as it affects the dependent variable and is contingent in nature, as prescribed by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Hartono (2017).</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">This study refers to the agency theory, which explains the contract between principal and agent, where the latter (agent) provides services on the behalf of the former (principal), who delegates some authority for decision making</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Jensen &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Meckling, 1976)</span></a><span class="font5">. The delegation may trigger agency conflicts caused by information asymmetry because the agent has more relevant information than the principal regarding the condition of the company and because the principal cannot judge whether the agent has worked in accordance with the agreement</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Armour, Hansmann, &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Kraakman, 2009)</span></a><span class="font5">. Tax aggressiveness is one of the type III agency conflicts, which occurs between the company as the internal party and the tax fiscus as the external party. Tax aggressiveness is a form of information asymmetry since the tax fiscus does not know about tax aggressiveness committed by the company as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Agency conflict within companies is believed to be minimized by the implementation of good corporate governance, which helps improve the mechanism of supervision by internal and external parties as well as by the government</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Ararat,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Claessens, &amp;&nbsp;Yurtoglu, 2021; Kim, Kim, Kim, &amp;&nbsp;Byun, 2010)</span></a><span class="font5">. Optimal supervision of corporate governance is expected to reduce tax aggressiveness</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Chan, Mo, &amp;&nbsp;Zhou,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2013; Kerr et al., 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">. Therefore, the following hypothesis was formulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">H</span><span class="font1">1</span><span class="font5">: Corporate governance negatively influences tax aggressiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Government’s involvement in companies through political connection is believed to be able to reduce agency conflicts between companies and the government. Politically connected companies tend to be more compliant with tax regulations and avoid tax aggressiveness </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Putra &amp;&nbsp;Suhardianto, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5"> because they get more optimal supervision from the government </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Lestari &amp;&nbsp;Putri, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5"> and try to maintain their image by avoiding high-risk actions such as tax aggressiveness </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Anggraeni, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. Therefore, the following hypothesis was formulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">H</span><span class="font1">2</span><span class="font5">: Political connection negatively influences tax aggressiveness.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/70311-2.png" alt="" style="width:380pt;height:178pt;">

One of the efforts to maintain reputation is by avoiding high-risk actions such as tax aggressiveness </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Bimo et al., 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. Family companies generally place family members on the ranks of the board of commissioners and the board of directors. The involvement of family members on the board is able to optimize supervision</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Ulupui, Utama, &amp;&nbsp;Karnen,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2015)</span></a><span class="font5">.

<p><span class="font5">The presence of the government through political connections and family members on the board optimizes supervision and prevents high-risk actions such as tax aggressiveness because family companies tend to maintain reputation</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Lee &amp;&nbsp;Bose,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2021)</span></a><span class="font5">, and political connection guarantees better supervision from regulators, media, and the public </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Chaney, Faccio, &amp;&nbsp;Parsley, 2011)</span></a><span class="font5">.

<p><span class="font5">Tax aggressiveness is measured using effective tax rate (ETR) and book-tax difference (BTD) because ETR has a good ability to detect the possibility of tax aggressiveness in the current year </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Schwab, Stomberg, &amp;&nbsp;Xia, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5"> and because BTD is able to provide information related to the current condition and future valuation of a company and to detect the possibility of earnings management between commercial profit and fiscal profit to produce lower tax calculations </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Luo, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ETR is measured by dividing the company's tax obligation by profit before tax, and BTD is measured by dividing the difference between profit after tax and taxable earnings by total assets of the previous year. Companies that do tax aggressiveness will have a negative ETR and positive BTD. In other words, the higher the ETR or the lower the BTD, the lower the likeliness of a company to commit tax aggressiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Corporate governance is measured by dividing the number of recommendations that have been implemented by the company by the number of recommendations from SE-OJK Number 32/SEOJK.04/2015, i.e. 25 recommendations.

<p><span class="font5">This study uses control variables to present a better research model. A variable can be used as a control variable if it has been frequently tested against the dependent variable and if the research results show that the variable is influential. This study uses three control variables: profitability, fixed assets, firm size. Profitability is measured by return on assets with the formula of net profit after tax divided by total assets of the previous year. Fixed assets are calculated by dividing the value of net fixed assets by total assets. Firm size is measured by Ln (total assets).</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Descriptive statistics are used to present an overview of the data. It consists of minimum value, maximum value, average value, and standard deviation, as presented in</span><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font5"> Table 2.</span></a><span class="font5"> ETR has the mean value of 0.253 or 25.3%, close to the corporate tax rate of 25% as applicable in Indonesia. This indicates that the sample companies tend to comply with the tax regulations. It is supported by the negative mean value of BTD, i.e. -0.035, which indicates that tax income is higher than the book income, signifying the low tendency for earnings management to reduce taxable earnings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Corporate governance has the mean value of 0.733, indicating that the sample companies have implemented at least 18 of the 25 recommendations based on SE-OJK Number 32/SEOJK.04/2015. Political connection has the standard deviation of 1.174, more than the average value of 1.037, which suggests a high gap between minimum and maximum values. Profitability (ROA), fixed assets (PPE), firm size (SIZE), and family ownership (KK) have the mean value greater than the standard deviation value, which indicates a low gap between minimum and maximum values.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This study also finds that family ownership does not strengthen the negative effect of corporate governance on tax aggressiveness (H</span><span class="font1">3 </span><span class="font5">is rejected).

<p><span class="font5">The last finding is that family ownership does not strengthen the negative effect of political connection on tax aggressiveness (H</span><span class="font1">4 </span><span class="font5">is rejected). Family ownership actually</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">eliminates the negative influence of political connection on tax aggressiveness. In other words, family ownership does not moderate the relationship. Based on</span><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font5"> Table 3,</span></a><span class="font5"> family ownership, when tested independently, has a negative effect on ETR, or a positive effect on tax aggressiveness. The results indicate that family-owned companies tend to commit tax aggressiveness. This can be explained from the point of view of the second type of the Agency Theory: agency conflict occurs between majority and minority shareholders </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Armour et al., 2009)</span></a><span class="font5">. Family companies as the majority shareholder tend to get more benefits from tax savings or rent extraction from tax aggressiveness</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Gaaya, Lakhal, &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Lakhal, 2017; Pratama, 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In regards to profitability (ROA), fixed assets (PPE), and firm size (SIZE), which serve as control variables, only does profitability affects tax aggressiveness </span><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font5">(Table 3 </span></a><span class="font5">and </span><a href="#bookmark18"><span class="font5">Table 4)</span></a><span class="font5">. The findings about the effect of profitability on tax aggressiveness in this study are contrasting each other. Based on the measurement of tax aggressiveness using ETR, profitability or return on assets has a positive effect on tax aggressiveness (negative coefficient on ETR method). Companies with high profitability tend to commit tax aggressiveness, and vice versa. The decision of a company to commit tax aggressiveness is caused by the fact that the company is able to position itself (with adequate resources) to do tax planning so that they are able to reduce tax and maintain company earnings to remain high </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Dewi &amp;&nbsp;Yasa, 2020; Dewi &amp;&nbsp;Noviari, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When BTD is used, the opposite result is obtained; that is, profitability or return on assets has a negative effect on BTD (tax aggressiveness). This result indicates that companies with high profitability tend to avoid tax aggressiveness, and vice versa, because they have earned high earnings and do not have incentives to do tax aggressiveness to increase profits. Tax payments made by the company do not make the company feel disadvantaged, so the company does not intend to commit out tax aggressiveness </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Subagiastra, Arizona, &amp;&nbsp;Mahaputra, 2016; Wicaksono, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The conclusions of the study are that corporate governance is not a solution to prevent tax aggressiveness and that political connection through the involvement of the government as a shareholder or top executive can prevent tax aggressiveness. In fact, companies owned by families have a higher likeliness of committing tax aggressiveness. However, family ownership is not a factor that strengthens or weakens the effect of corporate governance and political connection on tax aggressiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This research is limited to manufacturing companies in the period of 2016-2020; different sectors and periods may produce different results. In addition, this study failed to trace the ultimate ownership of several companies using OSIRIS. Therefore, whether or not a company is family owned cannot be concluded. Future studies are recommended to use samples other than manufacturing companies and use different periods to get findings that are more comprehensive. It can also use other databases, e.g. ORBIS or information from relevant ministries, to explore more deeply about the ultimate ownership of a company. In addition, it need to consider the distinction between the period before and after tax incentives in relation with COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
