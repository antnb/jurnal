Broiler is a type of poultry that has homeothermic properties namely keeping its body temperature constant even though it is at an environmental temperature higher than its body temperature so closed cages are used to minimize outside weather disturbances that may be experienced by livestock such as heat and rain The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of zoning in a closed house cage on the chemicalphysical quality of broiler meat and determine t
