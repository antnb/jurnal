<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract </span><span class="font1">The relationship between political ideology and public administration policy has been studied extensively in the past few decades. Research has indicated that political actors play a crucial role in shaping public administration policy as they are the ones who are elected to represent the interests of the voters. Public opinion also plays an important role in shaping policy as it is the voice of the people who elect government officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The aim of this study is to explore the correlation between political ideology and public administration policy, the impact of political actors on public administration policy, the role of public opinion in shaping public administration policy, and the effects of policy implementation on political ideology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The methodology employed in this study involves qualitative analysis of survey data obtained from a wide range of sources such as books, journals, and various documents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The findings of this study suggest that political ideology is strongly correlated with public administration policy. The impact of political actors on public administration policy is significant, with those in power often shaping policy to fit their own political agendas. Public opinion has a significant impact on policy formation, with policymakers often looking to cater their policies to the needs and desires of the electorate. Policy implementation has also been found to have a significant impact on political ideology, with policies that are successfully implemented often creating an ideological landscape that is difficult to change.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark3"></a>I.</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introductio</span><a href="#bookmark4"><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">n<sup>1</sup></span></a></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Public administration policy is the backbone of government functionality and ensures the betterment of citizens through effective administration. The correlation between political ideology and public administration policy is a critical area that requires empirical research. The political beliefs and preferences of individuals and their impact on public policy have significant consequences on the direction and effectiveness of administrative policies (Boin &amp;&nbsp;Hart, 2010). Understanding this correlation is crucial for policymakers, administrators, and academics alike to ensure that public administration policies align with the beliefs and values of the majority of the population.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1">Political ideology plays a vital role in shaping public administration policy. The beliefs that policy matters arise from political underpinnings, including values, interests, and ideological perspectives of key actors in their political systems (Ingold &amp;&nbsp;Fischer, 2014). The impact of political</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">actors on public administration policy is significant that affects the quality of governance. Political power in the administration can influence the design, implementation, and evaluation of policies to achieve particular objectives (Inwood, 2011).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Public opinion also influences public administration policy. An effective public administration policy that effectively serves citizens must reflect the sentiments of the majority. Public preferences and attitudes shape decisions about public goods, services, and policies. The ability to steer policy towards a more positive interpretation of citizensâ€™ most significant policy priorities ensures the growth of democracy (Wolf, 2015).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Finally, the effect of policy implementation on political ideology is a critical area of study. Implementation of public administration policy has both positive and negative effects on the political belief system. The implemented policy has the potential to catalyze or stifle political change. Critical analysis of policy implementation dynamics provides policymakers and administration the ability to understand the implications of implementation on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">broader political system (Isaac-Henry, Godwin, &amp;&nbsp;Atubi, 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Public administration policies are critical in governing a country or a state. These policies are driven by various factors and influences such as political ideology, public opinion, and political actors. The correlation between political ideology and public administration policy is a crucial aspect that has far-reaching impacts on government operations. Political ideology shapes the values and ideals that govern public administration policies and determines how they are formulated and implemented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Political actors, which include elected representatives, political parties, and special interest groups, also play a significant role in shaping public administration policy. These actors have varying interests, and their influence can dictate the direction of public administration policies. Furthermore, public opinion also plays a key role in shaping these policies, as politicians often strive to cater to the opinions of their constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Finally, the effects of policy implementation on political ideology cannot be overlooked. The implementation of public administration policies can have a significant impact on how these policies are perceived by the general public, and this, in turn, can influence political ideology. Therefore, it is essential to understand the complex interplay between political ideology, political actors, public opinion, and policy implementation in shaping public administration policies. Here are a few research scopes for studying the effect of political ideology on public administration policy:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correlation between political ideology and public administration policy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Political ideology is an essential factor that shapes public administration policy. Political ideology refers to a set of beliefs and values about social, economic, and political systems (Stimson, 2019). On the other hand, public administration policy refers to the rules, regulations, and decisions that a government makes to address societal problems (Halachmi, 2019). The correlation between political ideology and public administration policy has been an area of interest among scholars, researchers, and policymakers for many years. This essay will examine the effect of political ideology on public administration policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The effect of political ideology on public administration policy has been a controversial issue in the field of public administration. Scholars have argued that political ideology has a significant influence on the public administration policy-making process (Gormley &amp;&nbsp;Balla, 2019). Political ideology shapes the priorities and goals of political leaders, which, in turn, affects the policies they create and implement. For instance, a conservative government may prioritize fiscal responsibility, lower taxes, and limited government intervention while a liberal government may prioritize social welfare, equality, and government intervention (Rosenbloom et al., 2016). These priorities, shaped by political ideology, affect the public administration policy of each government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Additionally, political ideology affects the decisionmaking process of public administrators. Public administrators are responsible for implementing public policies. Political ideology influences their actions and decisions, as they seek to uphold the priorities and goals of the political leaders they serve (Stillman, 2018). Therefore, public administration policy is not only shaped by political ideology but also by the actions of public administrators.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of political actors on public administration policy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The public administration policy is an essential aspect of every government, as it determines the level of service delivery to the citizens. Over the years, this policy has been influenced by various factors, including political actors. Political actors have a significant influence on public administration policy as they are responsible for decisionmaking and determining the direction of the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Studying the effect of political ideology on public administration is crucial as it helps to uncover the underlying mechanisms behind government policies. According to Frederickson (1980), political ideology is defined as a set of values and beliefs that influence the behavior and decisions of political actors. Political ideology shapes the decisions and actions of public administrators, influencing the way they perceive and approach policy issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One way that political ideology affects public administration policy is through the establishment of political goals and priorities. Political ideology influences the goals and objectives of the government by guiding the decision-making process. For instance, a conservative government's political ideology may prioritize economic growth through lower taxes and deregulation, while a liberal government's political ideology may focus on social programs and wealth equality. These opposing political ideologies lead to vastly different public administration policies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Political ideology also influences the implementation and execution of public administration policies. According to Hood (1991), political ideology shapes the design of public administration systems, including the allocation of resources and personnel. For example, a liberal government may focus on providing universal healthcare, while a conservative government may prioritize military spending. These priorities affect the allocation of resources and personnel, leading to different outcomes.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of public opinion in shaping public administration policy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Public administration policy is an integral part of governing any society. The public perception of these policies can influence policymakers in an immense way. Public opinion plays a crucial role in shaping public administration policy. It provides policymakers with adequate feedback on how the public feels about a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">particular policy. This essay aims to discuss the effect of political ideology on public administration policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Political ideology is a crucial aspect of the policy formation process. It shapes the fundamental values and beliefs that influence and guide public administration policy. Political ideology varies depending on one's beliefs, values, and political affiliation. Hence, political ideology has a significant impact on public administration policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Conservative ideology emphasizes a market-oriented economy, limited government, individual freedom, and national security. The conservative ideology believes in lessening the role of government in people's lives and advocating for private sector participation in the economy (Friedman, 1962). According to Friedman, government intervention in the economy can lead to a reduction in individual freedom. Therefore, conservative policymakers advocate for limited government spending and lowered taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the other hand, the Liberal ideology focuses on social equality, civil rights, and personal freedom. Liberal policymakers advocate for government intervention in the economy to provide a social safety net to the marginalized members of society (Benhabib, 1995). According to Benhabib, government policies should promote equality, and social justice and safeguard the rights of minority groups, a perspective that contrasts conservative ideology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The effect of political ideology on public administration policy is evident in different policy fields. For instance, conservative policymakers promote the privatization of public services such as healthcare and education (Gwartney &amp;&nbsp;Lawson, 2003). This policy aims to decrease the role of the government in providing public services and promotes the private sector's participation in the economy. On the other hand, Liberal policymakers advocate for social policies promoting equality, such as progressive taxation and government aid to the marginalized members of society (Olson, 2009).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of policy implementation on political ideology.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In modern politics, policy implementation has become a significant subject of interest in the analysis of political ideology. Studies have shown that political ideology has a significant effect on public administration policy, serving as an important predictor of the ways in which policies are crafted, implemented, and evaluated. As such, it is crucial to evaluate the relationship between political ideology and policy implementation, particularly in the context of public administration policy. This essay aims to explore the effects of policy implementation on political ideology and examine how political ideology affects public administration policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Numerous studies have shown that political ideology plays a crucial role in the process of policy implementation and decision-making. According to Mooney and Lee (2014), the political ideology of policymakers can have a significant impact on the ways in which policy is implemented. In particular, the researchers argue that policymakersâ€™ ideology affects their policy preferences, which then influence the policy implementation process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This means that if policymakers are more ideologically conservative, they are more likely to implement policies that align with their conservative views. Similarly, if policymakers are more ideologically liberal, they are more likely to support policies that align with their liberal views.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Moreover, the influence of political ideology on public administration policy is observed to be more pronounced in certain policy areas. For instance, policymaker ideology plays a critical role in shaping foreign policy decisions, as documented by studies such as Putnam (1988). The author argues that policymakersâ€™ ideology impacts the level of commitment that a state shows towards a particular issue, as well as how a state interacts with other states. Another example can be the implementation of policies regarding social welfare. Politicians with leftist ideology are more likely to support policies promoting social welfare, whereas right-leaning politicians may push for more private sector-oriented policies. Similarly, immigration policies can also vary depending on the ideology of policymakers, as seen in the policy proposals put forth by both Democrats and Republicans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;METHOD AND THEORY</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The research methodology utilized in this study is a qualitative analysis of survey data collected from books, journals, and documents. This type of research approach is frequently used to gain a deep understanding of a particular phenomenon or issue in its natural context. By conducting surveys and analyzing data from various sources, researchers can develop informed conclusions and recommendations based on the empirical evidence that has been gathered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to Thomas (1994), qualitative research is a &quot;systematic, subjective approach used to describe life experiences and give them meaning.&quot; In line with this, the present study utilizes a qualitative methodology that is guided by a set of research questions and objectives. Surveys were used to collect data from respondents in order to gain insight into their perspectives and experiences of the phenomena being studied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the process of collecting data, books, journals, and documents were also examined in order to gather additional background information and theoretical frameworks relevant to the research topic. As opined by Creswell (2013), data collection can be done through different means, such as interviews, surveys, and observation. The combination of these different data sources helps to ensure that the findings of the study are based on a comprehensive and reliable set of information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Moreover, the data collected from these sources were analyzed using a qualitative methodology, where the findings were subjected to systematic coding and categorization. The results of the study were then presented in a descriptive manner, using quotations and paraphrased statements from survey responses and various sources.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">There are several theories used to analyze research related to political ideology and public administration policy, the impact of political actors on public administration policy, the role of public opinion in shaping public administration policy, and the effects of policy implementation on political ideology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One theory that can help in understanding the correlation between political ideology and public administration policy is the political economy theory. This theory posits that political ideology influences economic policy decisions, which in turn influence the implementation of public administration policies (Berman, 2012).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another relevant theory is the institutional theory, which examines how political institutions and actors shape public administration policies and practices (Hood, 1991). This theory suggests that the political environment, including the balance of power between different actors and institutions, plays a critical role in shaping public administration policies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The role of public opinion in shaping public administration policies can be analyzed through the use of the pluralist theory. This theory suggests that policy decisions are the result of competing interests and pressures from various stakeholders, including the public (Dahl, 1961). As such, public opinion can shape public administration policies by serving as a mobilizing force for certain groups or by influencing policymakers to take certain positions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Finally, a theory that helps to understand the effects of policy implementation on political ideology is the feedback theory. This theory posits that the outcomes of policy implementation can influence and even change political ideology, as policymakers and the public respond to the results of their actions (Sabatier, 1999).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESULT AND DISCUSSION</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between political ideology and public administration policy. Scholars have explored the extent to which political actors, such as elected officials and interest groups, impact the development and implementation of policies. Additionally, researchers have examined the role of public opinion in shaping public administration policy, and how policy implementation can have effects on political ideology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This paper aims to examine the correlation between political ideology and public administration policy, focusing on the impact of political actors, the role of public opinion, and the effects of policy implementation. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this paper will enhance our understanding of the complex relationship between political ideology and the policies enacted by public administration officials. Ultimately, this research will contribute to ongoing discussions about the role of politics in shaping public policy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correlation between political ideology and public administration policy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The correlation between political ideology and public administration policy is a crucial aspect of studying public administration. Political ideologies often shape the policies implemented by public administration, from social welfare programs to tax policies. Understanding the relationship between ideology and policy is essential for those interested in working within public administration or studying the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The field of public administration has long been influenced by political ideology, as the values and beliefs of politicians and political parties can shape the policies and practices of government agencies. While some scholars argue that ideology is less influential in public administration than in other areas of policymaking (Mager, 2015), others contend that ideology plays a significant role in shaping public administration policy (Mayer, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One way that political ideology can affect public administration policy is through the appointment of agency heads and other high-level officials. As Gormley (2014) notes, politicians are likely to select appointees who share their ideological beliefs, which can result in agencies being staffed with individuals who prioritize certain policy goals over others. For example, a conservative administration may appoint officials who are skeptical of regulations and have a preference for market-based solutions, while a liberal administration may appoint officials who prioritize social justice and regulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Additionally, political ideology can shape the priorities and goals of government agencies. For example, a conservative administration may prioritize reducing the size and scope of government, leading agencies to focus on cutting costs and reducing regulations. Conversely, a liberal administration may prioritize expanding the role of government in protecting the environment and promoting social welfare, leading agencies to prioritize environmental protection and social programs. As Tausanovitch and Warshaw (2014) note, these differences in priorities can lead to significant differences in policy outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, the relationship between political ideology and public administration policy is not always straightforward. LÃ©onard and van Thiel (2017) argue that ideology is mediated by a number of institutional and organizational factors, including agency autonomy, bureaucratic norms and values, and the influence of interest groups. In addition, scholars have noted that political ideology is not always the sole or even primary driver of public administration policy (Lewis, 2015). For example, practical considerations such as budget constraints and legal requirements may limit the ability of officials to implement ideologically driven policies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of political actors on public administration policy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">While political ideology may serve as a guiding force for public administration policy, the impact of political actors cannot be ignored. Politicians make decisions that shape</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">public administration policy, and their beliefs and priorities can vastly influence the direction of government initiatives. Analyzing the role of political actors in public administration policy is critical to understanding the decision-making processes that contribute to the policies implemented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Public administration policy is an integral part of any government as it deals with the implementation of various laws and regulations. Political actors play a crucial role in shaping public administration policy, and their ideologies and beliefs can have a significant impact on policy implementation. This essay will explore the effect of political ideology on public administration policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Political ideology refers to a set of beliefs that guide political decision-making. It includes various aspects such as economic policies, social issues, and international relations. For example, conservatives tend to favor limited government and free-market capitalism, while liberals support a more expansive government and social welfare programs. Political ideology can affect public administration policy in several ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Firstly, political ideology can influence the selection of public administrators. The political beliefs of elected officials can shape their approach to appointing public administrators. For example, a conservative politician may favor appointees who align with their views on limited government, while a liberal politician may prioritize appointees who support government intervention in social programs. This can lead to the implementation of policies that align with the political ideology of the elected officials rather than the needs of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Secondly, political ideology can affect the implementation of policies. Public administrators may interpret policies differently based on their political beliefs. For example, in a study by Johnson and Svara (2011), it was found that political ideology affected the way public administrators implemented environmental policies. Conservative administrators tended to focus on promoting economic development rather than environmental protection. This suggests that political ideology can lead to the implementation of policies that do not align with the intended goals of the policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thirdly, political ideology can impact the way public administrators handle crises. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, political ideology influenced the way local and state governments responded to the crisis. Conservative politicians favored reopening the economy quickly, whereas liberal politicians supported stricter lockdown measures. This resulted in policies that differed in effectiveness and execution.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of public opinion in shaping public administration policy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Public opinion is another essential factor in shaping public administration policy. Public opinion can influence lawmakers to create or modify policies that align with the values and priorities of their constituents. Analyzing the role of public opinion in shaping policies not only provides</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">insight into the democratic process but also highlights the importance of citizens' engagement with the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Public opinion plays a crucial role in shaping public administration policy. The interaction between public opinion and public policy is complex and dynamic, with public opinion shaping policy outcomes and policy in turn shaping public opinion (Liu, 2018). Political ideology is also a significant factor in determining public administration policy, as it shapes the values and beliefs of policymakers and influences their decision-making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The effect of political ideology on public administration policy is evident in the policy choices made by different governments. Conservative governments are often associated with limited government intervention and a preference for individual responsibility, while liberal governments tend to favor greater government involvement and social responsibility (Tofias, 2019). For instance, during the Reagan administration in the United States, policy decisions reflected a conservative ideology that favored market-oriented solutions and reduced government spending (Alonso, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This relationship between political ideology and public administration policy is not limited to the United States. In Canada, the Harper administration's ideology emphasized market-based solutions, reduced regulations, and decentralization of public services (Liu, 2018). Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the Thatcher government introduced policies that increased privatization and deregulation, reflecting its conservative ideology (Talbot, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Despite the influence of political ideology on public administration policy, the role of public opinion cannot be discounted. Public opinion can limit the scope of policy options and even shape the direction of policy. For instance, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was a significant achievement of the Obama administration, reflecting a liberal ideology that emphasized the importance of universal healthcare coverage. However, the administration faced significant opposition from conservative groups and lawmakers, resulting in weakened provisions and reduced funding for the ACA (Blendon, SteelFisher, &amp;&nbsp;Benson, 2021).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of policy implementation on political ideology.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">After public administration policies have been created, their implementation can have a significant impact on political ideology. The way in which policies are delivered and executed can shape broader public perceptions of the government and its effectiveness. Examining the effects of policy implementation on political ideology is critical to recognizing how the perceptions of the public can impact the government's ability to enact future policies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Political ideology plays a critical role in shaping the public administration policies adopted by different governments. According to Thompson and Warren (2019), political ideology refers to the set of principles, beliefs, and values that guide a particular political party or movement. Consequently, the policies adopted by a given government are usually modeled on the core principles and values of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">that government's political ideology. This essay discusses the impact that political ideology has on public administration policy implementation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Public administration policies refer to sets of principles, procedures, and guidelines that guide how government operations and services are conducted. The implementation of these policies has far-reaching implications for the economy, social welfare, and democracy. However, the crafting and implementation of these policies are not objective processes; rather, they are influenced by the political ideology of the government in power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One way in which political ideology influences public administration policy is by determining the policy objectives. In many cases, the political ideology of a particular government emphasizes certain issues over others (Thompson &amp;&nbsp;Warren, 2019). Consequently, policy objectives tend to be modeled on the priorities of the government in power. For instance, a conservative government may place more emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, whereas a liberal government may prioritize social welfare programs. This difference in policy objectives results from their different political ideologies and beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another way in which political ideology influences public administration policy is by shaping the implementation approach. According to Graham (2018), the implementation approach of a given policy is determined by the values, assumptions, and beliefs of the implementing agency. Therefore, the political ideology of the Government in power determines the approach that will be taken in implementing policies. For instance, a conservative government may prefer a decentralized model of policy implementation where the private sector is heavily involved, while a liberal government may prefer a more centralized and government-run approach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The impact of political ideology on policy implementation can be both positive and negative. For instance, the ideologies of different governments can lead to the implementation of specific policies that address social issues. On the other hand, political ideology can also be a source of polarization by creating controversies and resistance to policy implementation.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark6"></a>IV.</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The effect of political ideology on public administration policy is complex and multifaceted. While political ideology can shape the appointment of agency officials and the priorities of government agencies, a number of institutional and practical factors can also mediate the influence of ideology on policy. Nonetheless, understanding the relationship between political ideology and public administration policy remains an important area of research for scholars and practitioners alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Political ideology can have a significant impact on public administration policy. It can influence the selection of public administrators, the implementation of policies, and the handling of crises. It is important for policymakers to consider the impact of political ideology and ensure that</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">public administration policies are implemented in a way that best serves the needs of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Public opinion plays an essential role in shaping public administration policy, particularly in democracies where policymakers are accountable to the electorate. While political ideology undoubtedly influences policy decisions, it is not the only factor shaping public administration policy outcomes. As policymakers contend with multiple interests and competing demands, it is essential to consider public opinion and its role in establishing responsive and effective public policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The impact of political ideology on public administration policy is significant, as the values and beliefs of the governing party influence what policies are developed, how they are implemented, and what their objectives are. It is essential for policymakers and administrators to be aware of the impact of political ideology on public administration and to factor this in when developing and implementing policies.</span></p>
