<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">The MSME industry in the country is currently facing a difficult situation in this business environment that is constantly changing in complexity. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have an essential role for the economy of the country or region, including in Indonesia. The development of the MSME sector contributes to increasing economic growth and reducing the country's poverty rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the pandemic that has occurred, it has slowly created difficulties for existing MSMEs which makes MSMEs have to adapt in order to survive by starting to shift models business from the offline model switched to the online or digital model caused by social restrictions that had an impact on the business sector during the covid-1 nine pandemic at that time until this article was published, the problem of the Covid-19 pandemic was still not resolved, so the entrepreneurs had to adapt a lot and switch to trade online to be able to survive amid conditions and relevance to the sophistication of technology that continues to develop following the needs of today's society . The rapid development of technology coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic has further accelerated the public's able to use technology in various activities and transactions shopping to meet the needs of both primary, secondary, or tertiary needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For MSMEs, starting to do online shopping is an effort to market products and services and build relationships through internet media (Kotler &amp;&nbsp;Armstrong, 2013: 223) can help MSME businesses remain can survive. Low operating expenses, and high business success are the focal points for businesses (Ratanavilaikul, 2018). Astaki and Purnami (2019) good consumer word of mouth about product quality causes a purchase decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Business actors make various efforts to increase their sales and satisfy the needs of their customers. In addition, attractive advertisements and promotions can make consumers feel curious about trying to buy the product. Advertising and promotion have a giant impactor on consumers' interests and purchasing decisions. Advertising and promotion's role in sales volume is significant (Tangkuman and Saerang, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Making a decision is a basic psychological process that plays a vital role in understanding consumers' purchasing decisions. According to Suharman (2014), the purchase decision is where the buyer or prospective buyer has made his choice and then buys the product and then consumes it. The purchase decision process is the process customers go through when buying a product (Marie </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font4">.,2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The purchase decision can be defined as a continuous process that refers to the consistency of Actions that are wise and carried out to meet satisfaction and needs. When someone buys, they go through several stages from weighing the options and looking for alternatives before deciding to make a purchase. So that consumer purchasing decisions are a series of choices made by consumers to make purchases (Oladepo &amp;&nbsp;Odunlami, 2015).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Product quality is how the product has a value that can satisfy consumers physically and psychologically, showing the attributes or properties of an item or product (Kotler &amp;&nbsp;Amstrong (2015). Knowing the quality of a product is an essential thing for most consumers; with them knowing the quality of a product, they begin to talk, and it is not uncommon to provide an assessment of the product, as well as compare the product with other products between the quality of the product and the price of the product. Then there was communication from the appraiser's results, which resulted in communication</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">from the mouth or what is called word of mouth. Consumers' purchasing decisions are not only updated by the quality of a product but infrequently influenced by word of mouth</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Communication from person to person between the source of the message and its recipient regarding a product, brand, or service is a word of mouth. (Alves </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al. </span><span class="font4">,2016; Raouf &amp;&nbsp;Esmaeel, 2022; Isanawikrama &amp;&nbsp;Buana, 2022). Word of mouth as an exchange of ideas, thoughts, and comments between two or more consumers and none of them are marketers (Sumarwan, 2015). Word of mouth becomes a reference that requires customer expectations of a product (Martin </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font4">., 2015; Asnawati, et al., 2022; Ihsan, et al., 2022). Word of mouth has a significant influence on a person because the information is considered accurate and honest, and someone tends to trust the product information they hear from friends more, relatives or closest people who have an understanding of a product compared to information from advertisements (Nugraha </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font4">., 2015). Word of mouth aims to convey information about the attributes of various products and services, their use, or manufacturers (Dzian </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font4">., 2016). Word of mouth will occur naturally when people become supporters of a brand or product because they are satisfied with the product or brand, so that they have desires which comes from oneself to invite others enthusiastically to own the brand or product they use. Word of mout</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font4"> affects consumers' decision-making process when they think they will buy a product (Lerrthaitrakul &amp;&nbsp;Panjakajornsak, 2014; Saraswati &amp;&nbsp;Giantari ,2022; Hossny, 2022). Effective word-of-mouth communication supports consumers in choosing products and services offered by verbagai companies (Rukhiana, 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the research of Nugraha </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font4"> (2015)</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font4"> the word-of-mouth variable has a significant influence on the variable of purchasing decisions. Then is also supported by research conducted by Anwar (2015), which shows that product quality positively and significantly affects consumers' purchasing decisions. The better the quality of a product, what happens is positive word of mouth, and this will cause purchase decisions made by consumers and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maintaining product quality is an important thing that must be done by MSME Alissa Hijab, which was founded in 2020 and located in Denpasar City, engaged in Muslim fashion marketing mainly carried out through online shops, ranging from Muslim clothing, hijab and gamis with market segmentation for adolescent and adult women. Alissa Hijab emphasizes Muslim fashion by using pastel and soft colors so that it does not provide black. Alissa Hijab stated that they always use materials that are high quality but the selling price they are made not expensive so that they can be affordable by all people considering their target market comes from teenagers to adults, so, Alissa Hijab can be said to be a fashionable hijab brand, quality materials and affordable prices. Alissa Hijab's Marketing Team prioritizes high sales numbers rather than taking a big profit in each of its products, because Alissa Hijab always uses quality suitable materials in each product and always follow the developmental model of the times, which by maintaining good quality and can provide prices which is good in each of its products from consumers who do not know the quality about Alissa Hijab products want to buy them considering the price is affordable and the model which keeps up with the times, the hope is that consumers know the quality of Alissa Hijab's products with the ability to make purchase</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">decisions like and consider and feel k u the alitas of good goods, the low price of goods, and good capital make consumers feel fasting for Alissa Hijab products so that what happens is a positive word of mouth where this can make consumers make a purchase decision on the product and talk about it voluntarily to others who hope to increase sales and market Alissa Hijab products are faster by helping word of mouth. In theory, if consumers are satisfied with a product, service, or brand, they will be more likely to keep buying it and telling people about experiences that benefit them with the product in question (Oslon &amp;&nbsp;Paul, 2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Puspasari's research (2014) states that if a product has good quality and quality, consumers will feel happy using the product in question and the end, it will arise positive behavior and positive recommendations in others, customers who are satisfied with the quality of the products given by the company are also likely to make recommendations from the mouth of mouth is positive to others. (Irwanto </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font4">., 2013) stated that the quality of the product had a significant positive effect on positive word of mouth and the results of research by Rusadi &amp;&nbsp;Sujito (2012) stated that the quality of the product had a positive effect on word of mouth positive. Consumers will give a negative response and a negative recommendation for a product with low quality and quality. From the results of previous studies, it can be drawn hypotheses as follows: H</span><span class="font1">1</span><span class="font4">: Quality production has a positive and significant effect on word of mouth</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The influence of word of mouth in marketing will significantly impact a product itself; if word of mouth is positive, it will make consumers decide to buy Back to the product. The world of mouth variable has a significant influence on the variable of purchasing decisions, the positive information</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">obtained by potential consumers about a product encourages consumers to do paternity on purchases, according to research conducted by Nugraha </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font4">. (2015). The results of this study are supported by research conducted by Astaki &amp;&nbsp;Purnami (2019), which states that word of mouth has a positive and significant effect on purchases. If the experience is positive, word of mouth will have a positive impact, and vice versa. From the results of the previous study, the hypothesis in this study can be drawn as follows: H</span><span class="font1">2</span><span class="font4">: Word of mouth has a positive and significant effect on consumers ' purchasing decisions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Consumers make the decision to buy goods or goods through long considerations to consider the product worthy of purchase. Entrepreneurs can provide the right strategy to attract the attention of consumers, one of which is by providing a good product. This is supported by research carried out by Anwar (2015), which states that the quality of products affects purchasing decisions. It is also supported by research conducted by Anis </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font4">. (2015), which shows that quality products that are considered good by consumers will create purchasing decisions. The purchase decision will be made when the consumer has already chosen. Then it was supported again by research conducted by Astaki and Purnami (2019) quality products have a positive and significant impact on purchasing decisions. Based on the results of previous studies, this study the hypotheses as follows: H</span><span class="font1">3</span><span class="font4">: Quality products have a positive and significant effect on consumers' purchasing decisions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Word of mouth significantly influences variable purchasing decisions based on research conducted by Nugraha </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font4">., (2015). It is also supported by a study conducted by Anwar (2015) which states that the quality of the product affects the hassle of purchasing. In this case, the better quality a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">product will cause the occurrence of positive word of mouth, with the presence of a positive word of mouth will result in the occurrence of a positive word of mouth will result in the occurrence of purchase decisions by consumers of such products. On the other hand, if the product has a bad quality, negative word of mouth is likely to cause no purchase decision for such products by consumers. In this case, the researcher can draw the hypothesis as follows: H</span><span class="font1">4</span><span class="font4">: Word of mouth has a positive and significant effect on mediating the influence of product quality on consumers' purchasing decisions</span></p>
