Rounded shoulder posture is maladaptive posture with characteristic of shoulder protraction downward rotation and elevation with an increase in upper thoracic kyphosis The purpose of this study was to prove that the addition of the modified scapular stabilization intervention was better than shoulder strengthening in pectoralis minor stretching to improve scapular alignment in tailors with rounded shoulder posture This study is a true experiment study with pre
