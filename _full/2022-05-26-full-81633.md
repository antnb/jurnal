<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Language is an important part of our lives. Language and communication cannot be separated. People use language as a means of communication to express their thoughts and feelings. They communicate with each other using language in social interactions. Communicate directly or indirectly with others, both verbally and in writing. Therefore, language is an important part of communication in social life. In social life, language and society are two things that support each other. Language is a means of communicating with each other,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So it is not possible if there is a language less society and there is a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">language without society. Communication does not only involve the language uttered by the speaker but also the action is done by them. In some cases when the speaker utters something the real meaning is not only exactly and literally as what he/she saying but it often confuses the hearer because the speaker sometimes tends to utter it indirect way. Thomas (1995) says that people use indirect strategies when they want to make their speech more interesting, when they want to reach goals different from their partners’ or when they want to increase the force of the message communicated. However, it is helpful to understand the circumstances around the speaker and listener. Every conversation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">needs context. Mey (1993) says that one should not believe a speech act to be taking place, before one has considered, or possibly created, the appropriate context. In pragmatics this kind of action is called speech act. Searle (1976) states that all linguistic communication involves speech act. In order word, speech act are the basic or minimal units of linguistic communication. American language philosopher J.L. Austin defined speech act as what actions we perform when we produce utterances. When the speaker produces an utterance, it means the speaker is performing a certain kind of act such as giving order, asking question, making request or promises. According to Austin (1962), he says that to say something may be to do something or in saying something we do something. Leech (1983) claims that when a speaker makes an utterance, he commits three types of acts at the same time: locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary. The analysis of illocutionary act is an interesting subject to discuss, because, Illocutionary acts are the most complex of the three types of speech acts. Illocutionary act is an utterance with some form of function in mind. It is performed via the communicative force of an utterance. Declarative, directive, expressive, representative and commisive are the five categories of general duties performed by illocutionary act (Searle, 1969).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This study only looked at one sort of illocutionary act, the directive illocutionary act, and the illocutionary force of both direct and indirect directive illocutionary acts performed by the speaker in the movie 21 and 22 jump street. The directive illocutionary acts are speech acts used by a speaker to persuade someone else to do something. They express the speaker's desires. Ordering, commanding, requesting, pleading, begging, praying, entreating, instructing,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and forbidding are all examples of directive illocutionary acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The complexity of the implicit meaning of the utterance uttered by the speaker was worth analyzing, hence directed illocutionary acts were chosen as the study's focus.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>METHOD AND THEORY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">This study’s data is gathered from the dialogue of the characters in the movies 21 and 22 Jump Streets. This is a comedy, action movies, which was produced by Columbia Pictures and directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller. The first movie 21 Jump Street was published in the USA on April 18, 2014. The second movie (22 Jump Street) was published two years later on June 18, 2014, and directed by the same directors. Following their first success in the first movie. The two friends once again, are sent on a mission to a collage to investigate the use of recreational drug known as WHYPHY. This film was chosen because it has a high number of utterances that indicate directive illocutionary acts, which is the topic of this study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The data were collected by using documentation method and note taking technique. Then, the data was then sorted according to the theory used. This study used descriptive qualitative method to analyze the data. For short, the process of analyzing the data is done through the following steps: First, watching the whole film for few times and then choosing the speaker’s utterance that contains directive illocutionary act distinction according to (Bach &amp;&nbsp;Harnish, 1979), and then noted it down. In conducting this study, This study employed a number of theories, so the result of this study were presented using qualitative and descriptive methods. Firstly, the analysis was presented by presenting the selected data in the form of sentences. The speaker’s utterance was</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">then highlighted in italic and bold to clarify the component that was being analyzed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are two main theories applied in this study. First, the theory of directive illocutionary acts by (Bach &amp;&nbsp;Harnish, 1979), that divides the directive illocutionary acts into six types namely: requestives, question, permissive, requirement, advisories, and prohibitives. (1) Requestives expresses the speaker’s desire that hearer do action and the intention that the hearer do action because of speaker’s desire. (2) Question is a type of request in which the hearer is asked to give the speaker with specific information. (3) Requirements, in this type of utterance the speaker expresses his desire that the hearer take speaker’s utterance as a reason to act. (4) Prohibitives, such as restriction, prohibiting or forbidding are basically requirements that the hearer not do a specific action. (5) Permissive, such as prohibitives and requirements. In uttering his utterance, the speaker expresses his belief and his intention that the hearer believe that speaker’s utterance entitles him to act. (6) Advisories, in this type the speaker expresses is not the intention or desire that the hearer does a specific action, but the belief that doing it is a good idea. The second theory was applied to analyzed the data is IFIDs or the illocutionary force indicating device by (Yule, 1996). These devices that aid the hearer in identifying the illocutionary force of the speaker’s utterance. Performative verbs, mood, word order, intonation, stress are examples of Illocutionary force indicating device (IFIDs). In addition, there are three subtheories to support this analysis. First, the theory of context of situation by (Halliday &amp;&nbsp;Hasan, 1989). Second, direct and indirect speech acts by (Yule, 1996). Third, felicity conditions by (Vanderveken, 1990).</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Literature Review</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">“The study of Offering as a Commisive and Directive Speech Act: consequence for Cross-Cultural Communication” by (Ad-Darraji, 2012). His paper examines the art of offer from several angles. It also focuses on the act of providing philosophical, social, and cultural viewpoints through speech. This article appeared in volume 2, number 3 of the International Journal of Scientific and Research Publication (IJSRP) in March 2012. The pragmatic theory Searle's speech act is the major theory utilized in this article and support with cultural context by (Goddard, 2004) to explore how utterances are and should be understood in pragmatic context.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The findings reveal that offers are pre-event-commisive-directive acts that reflect the speaker's expectation of the listener in terms of future behavior, whether verbal or non-verbal. Furthermore, the interrogative usage of modal verbs &quot;can, could, will, would, shall, should&quot; was found to be the most common approach for encoding English offers. Those modals may use gentleness such as &quot;maybe&quot; to underline the addresser's recognition of the addressee's flexibility of action, and it is thought that cultural factors play a role in the variation of the speech act of &quot;offer.&quot; Despite the fact that the focus of this essay was on the commisive and directed illocutionary acts, it was nevertheless useful as a comparison and reference for this research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;The Study of Directive Speech Acts Used by Iranian Nursery School Children: The Impact of Context on Children's Linguistic Choices,&quot; by (Arani, 2012). The purpose of this study was to determine the types and functions of directive speech acts used by Persianspeaking youngsters. The author's purpose is to learn about the different methods used by speakers of nursery school age children in three areas: form</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">selection, negotiating communicative goals within conversation, and face protection. The International Journal of Applied Linguistics and English Literature published this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The findings revealed that children's directive speech acts confirm that they are aware of social parameters of talk (Andersen- Slosberg, 1990; Ervin, Tripp et al., 1990); then they use linguistic forms that are different from what adults use as politeness markers, such as polite 2nd plural subject-agreement on the verb, &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; words; and lastly they use declaratives with illocutionary force to mark distance (Andersen- Slos (Georgalidou, 2001). Because the topics of discussion in both studies are comparable, his paper becomes one of the references for this study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The study of directive illocutionary acts performed on Alex’s dialogue in movie Madagascar 3: Europe’s most wanted” by (Vaundra, 2017). Is concerned with the examination of the expression of directive illocutionary acts in the film Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, as well as the background of situations that support the directive of illocutionary acts. The goal of her research was to determine the intended meaning of Alex's speech in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted and to explain the background of the circumstance that supports the directive illocutionary conduct. To answer the first and second questions in his study, he used the theories of Searle (1969) Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts and Halliday and Hasan (1985) ethnography of communication S-P-E-A-K-I-N-G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to the findings of his research, various sorts of directive illocutionary acts were discovered in movie conversations. Ordering, inviting, requesting, recommending, commanding, and advising are examples of directive illocutionary acts found in declarative,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">imperative, and interrogative forms. Furthermore, the context of situation is linked to the conditions of speech acts; it influences the emergence of those actions, and the context of situation that supports the appearance of directing acts is comprised of three elements: field of situation, tenor of situation, and mode of situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The study of Illocutionary Acts Found in Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire by Joanne Kathleen Rowling.” By (Windrahanny, 2013). She focused on analyzing the expression of illocutionary acts in J.K Rowling's work Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The descriptive qualitative method was employed in the data analysis. Her research employed Searle's (1979) theory to determine the intended meanings of illocutionary acts performed by the characters in the novel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The findings of his research, all forms of illocutionary acts, including as assertive, commissive, instructions, declarations, and expressive illocutionary acts, were discovered in novel. There are a few distinctions between the two studies. The difference between the two studies can be seen in the analysis' focus. Her research focused on all sorts of illocutionary acts, whereas my research focuses solely on one type of illocutionary act, directive illocutionary acts. Furthermore, the subject of her and this research differs. He used a novel as the subject of her research, while this research focused on two films. Apart from that, her research contributed to the understanding of data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The study of Directive and Expressive Illocutionary Acts with Special Reference to Romantic Comedy Movie “American Pie 5” by (Kesumadewi, 2014). Her research attempts to determine the different forms of directive and expressive illocutionary acts that can be discovered in the film American Pie 5, as well as to explain the background of the situation that supports</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the appearance of directive and expressive illocutionary acts in the film. In her research, she used a descriptive qualitative method. As the fundamental hypothesis of her research, she used Searle's Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts theory. She utilized it to analyze the different types of illocutionary activities. In order to corroborate her analysis, she also employed Dell Hymes (1972) theory of Ethnography of Communication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several sorts of directive and expressive illocutionary acts were discovered in movie conversations as a result of her research. The sorts of declarative directive illocutionary acts found are commanding, inviting, and counseling. Blaming, apologizing, praising, applauding, and thanking are examples of expressive illocutionary acts found in declarative form.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>RESULT AND DISCUSSION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The findings of directive illocutionary acts found in the movie 21 and 22 Jump Street are presented in this chapter. There are eleven utterances indicated to direct and indirect directive illocutionary acts were analyzed based on the theories as elaborated in the previous discussion, those theories are: classification of directive illocutionary acts by (Bach &amp;&nbsp;Harnish, 1979) was used to identify the types of directive illocutionary acts and the illocutionary force indicating device by (Yule, 1996) was used to analyzed the illocutionary force of the utterance in the movies 21 and 22 Jump Street. I don’t think the synopsis needs to be presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The usage of the theories presented in the previous discussion is shown in the data below. There are several utterances classified as direct and indirect speech acts. This study were presented using qualitative and descriptive methods. Firstly, the analysis was presented by presenting the selected data in the form of sentences. The speaker’s utterance was</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">then highlighted in italic and bold to clarify the component that was being analyzed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Direct Directive Illocutionary Acts </span><span class="font3">Direct Requestives Data 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“You need to leave. You need to leave. You need to get out of here right now</span><span class="font3">.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In data (1) the speaker, Schmidt, performed a directive illocutionary act of requestive. According to Bach &amp;&nbsp;Harnish (1979) Requestives expresses the speaker's desire that the hearer do something. Moreover, it expresses the speaker's intention that the hearer takes this expressed desire as a reason to act. In this case, the speaker attempt to insist or request the hearer to leave the prom at any cost because the speaker knew that something bad will happen in that place and he does not want molly to get hurt if she stay there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The illocutionary force pronounced by the speaker in data (1) will be determined using illocutionary Force Indicating Devices or (IFIDs) by (Yule, 1996). Those devices are performative verbs, word order, intonation, and stress. In the utterance ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">you need to leave</span><span class="font3">’ performed by the speaker there is no performative indicating that it is a request. It means that in data (1), the performative verb is implicit. Seen from the syntactic structure, it is the form of imperative proposition and the illocutionary act expresses a request from the speaker and expresses the speaker's wish for the hearer to leave the prom. Since the imperative structure in data (1) is being used to make a request it is functioning as a direct speech act, there is a direct relationship between a structure and a function. When the speaker conveys his desire, he uses fall intonation and high accent on the word &quot;need&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The speaker's utterance must be felicitous in order for him to attain his goal by uttering his utterance. As a result,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the speaker's utterance must fulfill the felicity conditions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directive illocution of the utterance “</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">you need to leave”</span><span class="font3"> is the speaker (Schmidt) wants the hearer to do something. Schmidt requested the hearer to leave the prom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mode of achievement of the speaker’s utterance indicates that the speaker requesting the hearer to leave the prom, when the speaker in data (1) begs for the hearer, he leaves the hearer with the option of refusing. It indicates that the hearer has the option of fulfilling or ignoring the request.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">c. Propositional condition, the speaker’s utterance will carry out the future action. Thus, the future action carry out by the hearer is to leave the prom, but the hearer ignores his request because she is under the influence of drugs.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparatory condition of the speaker’s utterance is that the speaker assumes that the hearer will not obey his request, because Molly (the hearer) is already upset with the speaker.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerity condition, this utterance tries to make the hearer leave the prom because he does not want her to get hurt.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degree of strength, in data (1) The Speaker’s utterance less powerful than the act of promise.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The illocutionary force in data (1) is considered infelicitous because it does not carry out all the components of the felicity conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Indirect Directive Illocutionary Acts</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Indirect Requestives</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Data 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Guys, can we get rid of this stuff?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The speaker’s utterance “guys, can we get rid of this stuff?” is classified as directive illocutionary act of requestive. In this type of directive, it expresses the speaker's intentions that the hearer does something for him. Moreover, they express the speaker's intention that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">hearer take this expressed desire as part of his reason to action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to find out the illocutionary force performed by the speaker. Illocutionary Force Indicating Device or (IFIDs) by (Yule, 1996) was used to analyze the speaker’s utterance. The device includes performative verbs, word order, intonation, and stress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In data (2), there is no performative verb in the speaker's statement, indicating that it is a request. As a result, we must examine the situation surrounding him to determine the performative verb. The performed illocutionary force is asking. It is obvious, since the speaker attempts to request his parent to get rid of his old stuff. Seen from the syntactic structure, the speaker performs his utterance with interrogative proposition in the form of question. Through this utterance, the speaker does not only perform yes/no question but he also performed an act of requesting. The utterance in data (2) it is functioning as indirect speech act, because an interrogative used to make a request. The speaker also puts fall intonation into his utterance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The speaker's utterance must be felicitous in order for him to attain his goal by uttering his utterance. As a result, the speaker's utterance must fulfill the felicity conditions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directive illocution of the utterance “guys, can we get rid of this stuff?) Is that the speaker (Schmidt) wants the hearer to do something.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mode of achievement of the utterance indicates that the speaker requesting the hearer to get rid of his old embarrassing photos.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposition content condition of the speaker’s utterance indicates is that the hearer will accept his request, yet he was rejected.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparatory condition of the utterance is the speaker assumes that the hearer is incapable of satisfying the speaker's</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">desire. In this case his parents have more authority over the speaker.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerity condition of the speaker’s utterance indicates that the speaker expresses his intention that the hearer will get rid of his embarrassing photos.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degree of strength of speaker’s utterance in (2) has weaker degree of strength than the act of ordering.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The illocutionary force in data (2) is considered infelicitous because it does not carry out all the components of the felicity conditions.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>CONSLUSION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The first thing that can be derived as a conclusion based on the study and discussion above is the description of types of directive illocutionary acts. In this study, direct speech act and indirect speech are the two types of directive illocutionary acts conduct found in the movie 21 and 22 Jump Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the movie, there are six different sorts of direct directive act: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">permissive, requestives, advisories, requirements, and prohibitives. However, there are only five of six different sorts of directive illocutionary acts were found namely: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requirements, advisories,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">requestives, permissive, and prohibitives. The speaker’s utterance belong to direct, because there is a direct relationship between a structure and a function. Thus, an interrogative structure used to make a question is a direct speech act. But, when an interrogative structure used to make a request is an indirect speech act (Yule, 1996). The performative verb is implicitly shown &nbsp;when the &nbsp;speaker</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">conducts an &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indirect &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directed</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">illocutionary act. As a result, listeners must be aware of their surroundings. Aside from context, listeners must consider the word order and the intonation of the speaker’s utterance to determine the meaning or force of the speaker’s speech. The second thing that</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">can be derived as a conclusion is the illocutionary force were discovered in the movie are requesting, asking, forbidding, prohibiting, permitting, commanding, ordering, suggesting, and warning. Lastly, the thing can be derived as a conclusion is the illocutionary force will be considered felicitous or successful if all the components of the felicity conditions are met. Those components includes: (1) the illocutionary point, is the point from the speaker’s utterance to get the hearer to do something. (2) Mode of Achievement, is a way that is used to achieve the purpose from the speaker’s utterance. (3) Propositional content condition, is determined by the illocutionary point which lies in the utterance. (4) Preparatory Condition, when the speaker required something from the hearer, the speaker will make the hearer believe with his utterance. (5) Sincerity condition, when the speaker utters his utterance, the speaker also performs the psychological attitude like expressing his feeling.
