Frozen shoulder or commonly known as adhesive capsulitis is a condition of inflammation in the joint capsule or capsule that protects the glenohumeral joint The purpose of this study was to prove the effect of adding scapulothoracic joint mobilization interventions in increasing the range of motion and functional ability in individuals with a frozen shoulder The design used in this study was experimental with pre and post control group design involving 24 samples
