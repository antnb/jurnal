<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Literature Review</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Kotler (2000) broadly defines that image as the number of convictions. A descriptionof an image that belongs to someone on an object. The object itself can be a person, organization, group or other people he knows. There are five types of images, the shadow image (mirror image), the image of the prevailing (current image), the image of the expected (wish image), the image of the company (corporate image), as well as the image of the compound ( multiple image).

<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Concept</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Social networking Media</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Media is a necessity in the formation of an image of a tourist destination, there are many types of media, one of which is booming at the moment is the Internet media. Our internet media is able to recognize the web that serves a variety of the latest information we want. One of the webs that many loved today is a series of web 2.0 technologies that often we are familiar with the term &quot;social networking media&quot;.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Tourism Image</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">As with any other service industry, tourism industry also has the properties of intangibility, inseparability, heterogeneity, and perishability. These natures cause the tourists to deal with the lack of attributes to evaluate whether or not a destination is good. However, because decisions must be made, the tourist uses the image of the tourist destination to conduct an evaluation tool (Wallin Andreassen and Lindestad, 1998). Of course, the existing image in the minds of tourists is not always in tune with the real conditions of the destination itself. Thus, the image of the destination has the potential to affect the least competitive destinations (LeBlanc and Nguyen, 1996).</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Research Model</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Bali is a tourist destination, which is favored by both domestic and international tourist. Bali is so famous for its tourism, because tourism in Bali is a commodity sectors which provide a very large supply of foreign exchange for Indonesia. This is evidenced by the presence of data from the BPS that states within the last five years tourist that arrived in Bali increased significantly which can certainly have a direct impact in increasing the rate of the economy of Indonesia in the future. To know Bali tourism image will require a medium that can represent a good image for the Bali tourism destinations, because, once a lot of people know the condition of tourism in Bali from mouth to mouth, or better known as word of mouth, but now with the advance technology there are many media that can be used to see how the condition of Bali tourism, such as TV, radio, magazines, pamphlets, and the Internet, but the media to be used in this research is the internet media.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There are many existing social networking media, this research on Bali tourism image chooses social networking media that is often used by people today such as, Facebook, Twiter, both of which have become so attached to part of the lifestyle of today's modern society. The performance of the two sites is also very quick in order to know how Bali tourism image in Bali, because both Facebook Twitter are showing comments from tourists who become consumers of the company that became a part of the tourism world, such as hotels, villas, restaurants, SPAs , Bali tourism image in the social networking media, an observations is conducted on the comments of both social networking itself, where the comments of the tourists are a very important role to create a separate of Bali tourism image.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After all these comments obtained it will be classified into the comments which belong negative, positive, and do not know (Unidentified Comment) category, comments by category did not know this leads to the comments made by the tourists but it is very difficult to identify in order to enter into the category of positive or negative comments. While all comments from both social networks are successfully classified then it is analyzed based on the magnitude of the negative comments, positive, and the comments that go into such categories do not know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The results obtained in the positive, negative, and do not know (unidentified comments) comments on the social networks that have been selected can then be summed up and the first results indicate whether the results of the tourist’s perception was positive or negative about the Bali tourism image in social networking. After the analysis of social media is conducted, it shows wheatear the analysis of both the social networking media can fairly represent the image of the present condition of tourism in Bali, so it is more likely to lead to positive or negative direction. The final result of this analysis is very important in determining Bali tourism image in the future. Image is very important for a tourist destination and it is this which should</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">always be remembered by Bali, because the tourism sector is this island has an active role in improving the economy of Indonesia.

<p><span class="font3">At least with the advance technology it could be a benchmark for measuring how the image of Bali tourism in the social networking area, because it is very important to control whether the image of Bali as a tourist destination preferred by the whole world is still shining and prosperous in the future. Having obtained the results of calculations of data from Facebook and Twitter then it is supporting result is analyzed using the 4A approach which consist of amenities, attraction, ancillary, and accessibility, this approach serves to be able to identify the types of indicators that affects tourists coming to Bali. Besides, seen from the homepage analysis performed on TripAdvisor and Agoda.com, as well as to support the strength of the data obtained in the result of social networking and other online media, a research field is also conducted where the data obtained from the questionnaire distributed to one hundred tourists who was on holiday in Bali. Data from these tourists include data regarding the evaluation on accommodation, restaurants, SPA, travel agents, money changer, media, airlines and tourist attraction, all the recorded data that has been obtained to determine how the perception of tourists in real conditions and the results of the data on the virtual world.</span></p>
