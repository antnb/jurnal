We present a narrative review to examine the role of exercise and L-carnitine in relation to muscle strength during the aging process. The combination of LC and exercise holds promise as a potential intervention. Both LC and exercise have shown benefits in mitigating the loss of muscle mass"

LC and exercise both have impact to improve muscle strength in aging but further studies have to be made to assess precisely how the combination of both may benefit for the elderly.

Aging is an inevitable process and it can affect various aspects of the human body including the musculoskeletal system Lcarnitine LC has the potential to be used in conjunction with exercise to mitigate the loss of muscle strength associated with aging This review aims to investigate the impact of LC and exercise on muscle strength in the context of aging We conducted a comprehensive literature search using various online databases such as PubMed EMBASE
