<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract: </span><span class="font4">This study examines the oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> in Karangasem regency with the main focus was analyzing the structure, function and meaning of oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> by using the theory of structure, theory of function and theory of semiotics. The theory of structure was used to analyze the structure of oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4">. The theory of function was used to analyze the function of the oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> and the theory of semiotics was used to analyze the meaning of the oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4">.The present study was a qualitative study with systematic study that departs from theory to observation on the availability of data for further analysis and data validation. The approach used in this study was a phenomenological approach that moved from the phenomenon of language used in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4">. The implication of this study is expected to provide benefits to the linguistic approach in studying the structure, function and meaning of the other texts and other literary works. In this study, it was found that oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> is literary work which has macro structure, super structure and micro structure. The function of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> includes: entertainment function, education function, function of remembering the past, solidarity function, social control function, social protest and criticism function, and religious function. Meanings of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> includes: meaning of love, meaning of the collective consciousness, meaning of ritual, existence of social stratification recognition. Creation process of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> text is done together spontaneously by a group of people who are gathered together. Inheritance process of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> is done naturally and non-naturally so that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> can thrive in Karangasem society.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The development of modern era nowadays burgeoning rapidly has affected the existence of oral tradition in Bali. The oral tradition will survive if such tradition can still be actualized in the life of society at the present time. Many oral traditions that embody meaningful values and high culture are no longer to grow in the community because of lack efforts to preserve in the germane. One of the oral tradition forms that still burgeons and survives in the society is oral literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">105</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/34675-1.png" alt="" style="width:68pt;height:37pt;">
<p><span class="font4">July 2017. Vol. 11. No. 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Oral literature is also a culture which is spread out inherently or ‘mouth to mouth’ (Hutomo, 1990: 1). Oral literature is part of the culture which is preserved by the societal community from generation-to-generation. In other words, it is admittedly that oral literature is a part of the culture of people which needs to maintain and preserve. One of oral literary form which is still maintained for its existence is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> tradition</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">. Genjek</span><span class="font4"> effectuates Balinese oral literature, art and culture activities become vivacious and alive. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Genjek</span><span class="font4"> as a culture of community has permeated the system of the Balinese who lives in groups and is kept on, inherited from generation to generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font4"> riveting performance </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of genjek is</span><span class="font4"> adored by either local people or foreign tourists. It is caused by the elements of humor, entertainment, education and the values of local noble culture which attach in it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Genjek</span><span class="font4"> has already become a social identity and pride for the Balinese, particularly the people of Karangasem. The burgeoning of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> in the society is not only used as a means of religious performance, but also as a medium to maintain the moral values of humanity. In line with the economic development and tourism in Bali, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> is also used as a commodity for tourism favored by domestic and foreign travelers. In a societal system, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek </span><span class="font4">indirectly affects its lover to behave as social and civilized beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In responding to the globalization era, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> has witnessed the shifts in terms of its performance form, function, and meaning. Such changes occur as a result of the conformation of the time. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Genjek</span><span class="font4"> life as an oral tradition would not be alive unless it was changed. Oral tradition undergoing changes owns innovations adapted to the context of the times. The ability to adjust with modernization or context of the times is the dynamism of an oral tradition (Sibarani, 2012:3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> has been burgeoning rapidly in Bali, the text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> is not in written form yet. It is likely caused by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> artists who tend to apply any existing discourse directly prior to writing the text. As an oral discourse, the text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> denotes an oral text which is natural and direct, as well as constitutes situational contexts such as religious, social, economic, political, legal and cultural background. In its performance, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> is conveyed in a monologue and dialogue discourse. Monologue discourse is discourse that is spoken from one side. Generally monologue discourse does not entail and provide time application to the audience respond. The delivery is in one-way, that is from the speaker, while the dialogue discourse is</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">July 2017. Vol. 11. No. 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">discourse that is spoken within the two sides, the speaker </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(addressees)</span><span class="font4">, i.e., someone who speaks, and the listeners, i.e., someone who listens (Mulyana, 2005: 53).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The rationales to conduct the study of oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> in Karangasem are based on some reasons. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Firstly,</span><span class="font4"> the orality in Bali is being abandoned by the Balinese; thus, it is necessary to make the documentation in written texts</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">. Secondly, genjek</span><span class="font4"> is performed spontaneously and orally in which the creativity adapts the changes of time. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Thirdly,</span><span class="font4"> the shifts of the Genjek performance which was originally noncommercial becomes commercial performance. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fourth, genjek</span><span class="font4"> contains noble values of societal life and has a variety of uniqueness and distinction that is genjek (1) is performed by communal-agrarian society; (2) is an oral tradition favored by the people; (4) is beneficial to the community due to the noble values: social, cultural, economic, political, moral, ethical, religious values; (5) is a tradition which is able to maintain the existence of the Balinese language; (6) is able to develop the Balinese language; (7) is used to preserve the language and literature of the Balinese; (8) creates new possibilities, both in language and literature terms; and (9) develops a positive and creative mindset.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Problems examined in this research are directed to investigate the oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> as a literary style text which exists and burgeons in a social reality in Karangasem. In this study, three research problems are discussed, namely: (1) how are the process of creation and the structure of oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> in Karangasem regency?, (2) what are the functions of the oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> in Karangasem regency?, and (3) what are the meanings of the oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek </span><span class="font4">in Karangasem regency?.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In accordance with the character of the problems studied, the purpose of this study is comprised into two broad of purposes namely general and specific purposes. Regarding general purpose, the present study is conducted to actualize the theory in accordance with the problems studied. In addition, the study is conducted generally with the aim to explore, maintain, understand the social and cultural values contained in the oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek,</span><span class="font4"> due to the fact that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> is a cultural heritage of nation which is useful for society, notably the youth generation. In addition to general purpose, this study also yields the specific purposes those are (1) to figure out the process of creation and structure of the oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> in Karangasem regency; (2) to determine the functions of oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> in Karangasem regency; and (3) to postulate the meanings of oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> in Karangasem regency.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The results of this study will not only benefit theoretically, but also practically. In addition, the present study is expected to provide benefits for the sake of a wider range of nations, states, and mankind and can support the sustainability of community life with local culture base. The significances of this research can be subsumed into two, namely the theoretical and practical benefits. Theoretically, the study of oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> in Karangasem regency is expected to shed more light on the development of science broadly as well as beneficial to the nation, the state, and mankind. The theoretical benefits which can be attained from this research are: (1) as an additional reference to the body of research which contains an objective description of structure, functions and meaning of oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4">. as a symbol of the internal and external identity of the people of Karangasem; (2) as an additional reference to buttress the position of oral discourse as one of the theoretical perspectives and methodological orientation in the analysis of oral discourse; (3) as an addition to the repertoire resulted in the research by using theory of folklore and oral tradition in studying the cultural ethnography with the localideography base.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Practically, the results of this study can be used as a guidance for the societal community and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> groups in Bali, or even outside Bali. The present study can also be used as a reference in terms of improvement, enhancement, and preservation of societal culture. In addition to the benefits that are already mentioned above, the results of this study are also expected to have positive effects on: (1) the acceptance of local people to the existence of oral literature that are already marginalized; (2 the protection to marginalized role of oral literature in various aspects of community life; ( 3) one of the source of reference for the local government of Karangasem regency to build a society with culture base; (4) the source of reference for the local government of Karangasem regency to develop tourism with cultural base; (5) the establishment of harmony and solidarity, particularly between the people of Karangasem and generally among The Balinese; (6) the source of reference for other researchers of oral tradition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> who have willingness to design research model of function and meaning or other aspects associated with the oral tradition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek;</span><span class="font4"> (7) one of the efforts to preserve and maintain for the oral traditions that exist in the society of Karangasem which is still useful to the welfare of the society; (8) one of the attempts to document the oral texts of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> so that the next generations are aware of and knows their early oral tradition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4">; (9) the noble values contained in oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark5"></a>2.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical Basis</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The present study employs structuralism, functional, and semiotics theory. Structuralism theory is basically a way of thinking about the world, notably dealing with the respond and description of the structure. In this vantage point, a literary work is assumed as a phenomenon having a structure which is linked to one another. According to Jonah (cited in Endraswara, 2008: 49), structuralism is often understood as a form in which a literary work is a form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Van Dijk (1985a: 1-8) postulates that the formal structure of a text can be studied in depth by examining the macro-structure, superstructure, and micro-structure. The macro-structure is to reveal the global meaning of text that can be studied based on the topic/theme contained within the text. The superstructure is a text frame covering introduction, contents, and closing. The microstructure is a text structure based on the linguistic units, such as: sound, words, phrases, clauses/phrases and syntactical relationship, discourse cohesion, system of formula and style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The functional theory used as a reference is the theory adapted from William R. Bascom. Bascom’s theory (cited in Sukatman, 2011: 11) generally denotes four important functions of the oral tradition. Firstly, the oral tradition serves as a projection system (reflection) of a collective delusion. Secondly, oral tradition serves as a tool of cultural legitimacy of institutions. Thirdly, the oral tradition serves as an educational tool. Fourthly, the oral tradition serves as a means of coercion or control so that the norms of the community are always adhered by their collective members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The semiotics theory used in analyzing the oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> aims to figure out the meanings contained in the oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> which entails a system of signs. It is based on the assumption that the oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> denotes a meaningful structure. Oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> can be subsumed into the works of art for using language as a medium to convey. The language used in the oral tradition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> has a different language-use level from ordinary communication because it entails beautiful and meaningful elements.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark7"></a>3.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methodology</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The approach used in the present study is a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">qualitative approach. Qualitative</span><span class="font4"> approach can reveal various qualitative information on the problems examined. Moleong (1988:17) contends that qualitative research is defined as a process of seeking a better understanding regarding the complexities involved in human interaction. This research was conducted in a village of Seraya, as the main location, and other villages in Karangasem regency as genealogical community deployment of Seraya village. This was done due to the villagers taking </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> tradition into their migrating villages. The selected key informants are practitioners of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> or persons directly involved in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> oral tradition in Karangasem regency. These key informants are used as source of primary data of the research. At the stage of exploration, the data was received from respondents by using </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">snowball</span><span class="font4"> technique. The data used in this study are subsumed into primary data and secondary data. The primary data were data gained from field observation involving oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> in Karangasem obtained from the direct recording of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek </span><span class="font4">performances and the recordings of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> in the form of audio and video gathered from the key informants. The key informants are chairpersons or coordinators witnessing a direct experience of oral text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> in Karangasem regency. While, secondary data are audio-taped gained from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bali Records</span><span class="font4"> which constitutes audio cassette-recorded of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> Karangasem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Data collection employed in this study was observation, interview, recording, and documentation. In line with the use of multiple data collection above, data collection techniques applied were recording, listening, and note-taking techniques. The process of data analysis in this study began with reviewing of all data collected from observations, interviews, and documentation. The data were analyzed qualitatively by describing the data in detail and completed with argumentation. Data analysis procedures carried out gradually using the sequence system of activities: data selection, transcription of data, selection of corpus data, translation, and data analysis.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Genjek</span><span class="font4"> creation process happens naturally in which a group of people gathered and then singing words in Balinese language. Gradually, these words were formed into a lyric that was sung together. The lyrics which was sung together and then recorded using a simple tape</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">110</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/34675-6.png" alt="" style="width:88pt;height:47pt;">
<p><span class="font4">July 2017. Vol. 11. No. 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">recorder. In a subsequent meeting the lyrics was sung again and improvements were added if there are lyrics that are less precise to make it perfect to be performed to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The process of creation is naturally done due to the creation of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> lyrics are not done in a planned way. The players gathered together after working all day and then making jokes while singing and eventually </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> lyrics are created together. There was no writing activities were conducted before the lyrics of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> were created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The inheritance process of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> oral tradition happens naturally and non-naturally. The natural inheritance goes naturally from generation to generation. Non-natural process is a process of inheritance of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> oral tradition by doing </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> training programs for youth in art studios, in youth groups, and also in formal institutions. Inheritance process is also done by holding competitions and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> activities in artistic collaborations with other performing arts, and colossal performance of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4">. Both forms of inheritance are already running in Karangasem regency. That is why </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> oral tradition still exist in Karangasem regency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Genjek</span><span class="font4"> oral text was obtained from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> performances in Karangasem and then in depth study was conducted to get a true </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> text structure. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Genjek</span><span class="font4"> text structure consist of the opening part, the main core part and the closing part. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> text structure was analyzed using the theory of Van Dijk. The result of analysis based on Van Dijk’s theory indicated that the text structure of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genjek</span><span class="font4"> has three levels: the macro-structure, superstructure and microstructure.
