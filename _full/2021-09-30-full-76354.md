<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">An animated cartoon character is a character created or depicted in an animated story with the aim of supporting the story in an animated film.<sup>1</sup> Animated cartoon characters can be categorized as fictional characters deliberately created by the Creator as the main characters in a story. Animated characters usually found in a cartoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Cartoons are familiar among children to adults. A lot of people are anticipating the show. As per today, cartoons continue to develop through various media, such as movies, which known as animation.<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The publication of an animated work often features an animated character as the main focus. Animated characters are generally made in funny, interesting and unique form in order to impressed the reader or audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Speaking of animation, there are several characters which is well-known in the world, namely: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck</span><span class="font2">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Goofy</span><span class="font2">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pluto</span><span class="font2"> and other characters from Walt Disney which has been known by society as one of the animations that portray the meaning of genuine friendship.<sup>3</sup> Tracing back, the character of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Micky Mouse </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Minnie Mouse</span><span class="font2"> were first introduced in 1928 in the short film “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Steamboat Willie</span><span class="font2">”</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">.<sup>4 </sup></span><span class="font2">Since then, the character </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mickey Mouse</span><span class="font2"> character has appeared in 130 animated films and the animation has been shown on television since 1955.<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The characters were created by Walt Disney who was on a train from Manhattan to Hollywood at a time when Walt and his brother were at their lowest point.<sup>6</sup> As it has developed, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mickey Mouse</span><span class="font2"> is now even known as “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the most popular character of Walt Disney’s animated cartoons and arguably the most popular cartoon star in the world</span><span class="font2">”.<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fame of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mickey Mouse</span><span class="font2"> characters and other animated characters is often used by the public in various ways. Nowadays, a lot of products of clothes, bags, shoes, or children’s accessories that include animated images derived from cartoons.<sup>8</sup> It aims to attract buyers to increase the sales of these products.<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 2019, Disney filed a lawsuit against an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">online</span><span class="font2"> clothing store in Orlando for copyright infringement.<sup>10</sup> Disney as a plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Eric Wichhart, owner of Mouseprint Media and disgeardesigns. com over the use of similar designs on his online goods and businesses.<sup>11</sup> Disney through its proxy filed a claim for damages and permanent injunctive relief.<sup>12</sup> According to Disney, the Disgear logo owned by the Defendant has similarities to the Disney logo. These similarities have an impact on consumers’ belief that Disgear is part of Disney.<sup>13</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Similar thing also happened in Indonesia. A lot of products with Disney characters such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mickey Mouse</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Minnie Mouse</span><span class="font2"> can be easily found on items in Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Characters resembling </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mickey Mouse</span><span class="font2"> are also sold through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2">-</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">commerce</span><span class="font2"> by several online stores.<sup>14</sup> There is no guarantee that it is done with permission from Disney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the background abovementioned, it is important to examine in depth the legal issues related to the protection of animated cartoon characters based on copyrights law and how it is protected as trademarks.</span></p>

This paper emphasizes on the protection of animated cartoon characters based on the provisions in copyright law and the protection of animated cartoon characters that used as trademark.</span></p>

A. that examined </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the Law of Anime: Otaku, Copyright, Fair Use and Its Infringement in Indonesia.</span><span class="font2"> In this study, the author focus was on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">anime</span><span class="font2">, copyright infringement of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">anime</span><span class="font2">, copyright issues faced by Indonesia, copyright protection of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">anime</span><span class="font2"> in Indonesia as well as provisions on Fair Use.<sup>15</sup> In 2017, Setyanata, M also examined </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the United States of America Addressing Intellectual Property Piracy in Creative Economy: Measure Taken on Movie Piracy in Indonesia during Jokowi Era (2014-2016).</span><span class="font2"> In this study, the focus was about the protection of copyright in the United States namely on actions to reduce piracy of copyright products, especially Hollywood films and discussions or workshops with Indonesian representatives to raise awareness of the importance of intellectual property rights to protect creative economic products.<sup>16</sup></span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>3.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protection of Animated Cartoon Characters Based on Copyright Law</span></h2></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Animated cartoon characters are known as a character which is a product of human creativity and intelegency. The animate cartoon characters are classified as an intellectual property right, which is protected under the copyright regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Indonesia, the protection of animated cartoon characters is protected under the Law No. 28 of 2014 concerning Copyright (hereinafter referred to as “Copyright Law”). According to Cambridge Dictionary, “animation is also the process by which an animated movie, especially a cartoon is made from drawings done by hand or by a computer”. This definition emphasizes that animated cartoon characters can be classified as animation which is made by hand through a computer program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Principally, the protection of animated cartoon characters is protected under the copyright regime as stipulated under the provision of Article 40 point-4, which includes “fine art works in any forms such as paintings, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">drawings</span><span class="font2">, engravings, calligraphy, carvings, sculptures, or collage”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">According to the copyright regime, the protection of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">drawings </span><span class="font2">is given automatically after it is declared in an expressed work. This principle is stipulated in Article 1 point-1 of the Copyright Law, as follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Copyright means an exclusive right of the author vested automatically on the basis of declaratory principle after Works are embodied in a tangible form without reducing by virtue of restrictions in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The protection of copyright is known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">automatically protection</span><span class="font2">. <sup>18</sup> The concept is adopted from the Berne Convention.<sup>19</sup> According to this concept, the recordation of works and related rights products is not a requirement to obtain Copyright and Related rights, hence it is optional and not mandatory.<sup>20</sup> Although in Copyright Law is given automatically protection and recordation is not mandatory, but if the Author or Copyright Holder choose to conduct the recordation, it will certainly be more beneficial since the recordation may prove the ownership to the work concerned in</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">case of impersonation or plagiarizing of the work itself.<sup>21</sup> More over, the Copyright Law also recognized the principle of first to use</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">.<sup>22</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The concept of protection embraced in the Bern Convention is a basic right principle originally embraced by French copyrights that prioritize scientific rights as embraced in the mahzab of natural law that essentially believes that copyright is not a gift from others, but is born naturally and attached to an individual.<sup>23</sup> It is in accordance with John Locke’s idea that mainly expressed that a natural right will naturally be born on a creation derived from the investments made by individuals, hence the intellectual property is considered as an individual rights of the Author or Creator.<sup>24</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a part of expressed work, the protection of animated cartoon characters is closely related to the theory of intellectual property protection as stated by Robert M. Sherwood, namely reward theory, recovery theory, risk theory, incentive theory, and economic stimulus theory</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">.<sup>25</sup></span><span class="font2"> According to reward theory, the Author or Creator should be given the opportunity to be rewarded for their works.<sup>26</sup> The implementation of this theory can be found in the provision of Article 4 of Copyright Law, which mainly regulated the exclusive rights comprising moral rights and economical rights. The moral rights as stipulated in the Copyright Law is eternally inherent to the Author and cannot be transferred as long as the Author is alive.<sup>27</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The protection of moral rights is regulated under the provision of Article 5 of Copyright Law, which stated that it is eternally inherent to the Author to do several things, namely:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“continue to include or to exclude their name on the copy with respect to the public use of their Works;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use an alias or pseudonym;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change their Works to comply with appropriateness in society;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the title and subtitle of their Works; and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defend their rights in the event of a distortion of Works, mutilation of Works, modification of Works, or other acts which will be prejudicial to their honor or reputation.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In accordance to the idea of Sherwood, namely incentive theory, the Copyright Law also regulated about the protection of economical rights of the Author or Copyright Holder as stipulated under the provisions of Article 8 and Article 9 of Copyright Law. According to Article 9 paragraph (1) of the Copyright Law, it is stipulated that “the Author or the Copyright Holder has the economic rights to engage in publication of the Works; Reproduction of the Works in all its forms; translation of the Works; adaptation, arrangement, or transformation of the Works; Distribution of the Works or their copies; performance of the Works; Publication of the Works; Communication of the Works; and rental of the Works.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Further, the provision of Article 9 paragraph (2) of Copyright Law stipulates that “Every Person who exercises the economic rights as referred to in section (1) is obligated to obtain permission from the Author or the Copyright Holder”. More over, the Copyright Law also regulated a prohibition from exercising Reproduction and/or Commercial Use without any permission from the Author or the Copyright Holder as mentioned in Article 9 paragraph (3) of the Copyright Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">According to the Copyright Law, the protection of animated cartoon characters which is considered as works of drawings endures of the life of the Author and still protected for another 70 (seventy) years after the Author’s death, commencing from 1<sup>st</sup> January of the year following the event. This provision is regulated under the Article 58 paragraph (1) of the Copyright Law. In the event that copyright protection of the work is owned or held by legal entity, the protection endures for 50 (fifty) years since its Publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Besides, the Copyright Law also protected any “translations, interpretations, alterations, anthologies, databases, adaptation, arrangement, modification and other works resulting from transformation” without prejudicing the Copyright on the original Works as stipulated in Article 40 paragraph (2) of Copyright Law. This provision has been acknowledged internationally as “derivative works”.<sup>28</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The regulation concerning </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“derivative work”</span><span class="font2"> is stipulated under </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Article 2 paragraph (3) Berne Convention</span><span class="font2">, which stated that “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">derivative works as translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and other alterations of a literary or artistic work, which shall be protected as original work without prejudice to the copyright in the original work</span><span class="font2">”. The provision emphasizes that the transformed work is understood as a derivative work in the form of translation, adaptation, arrangement, and other alterations of a literary or artistic work remain protected as the original work without prejudice to the copyright on the original work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Following the ratification of Bern Convention through Presidential Decree No. 18 of 1997 on the Ratification of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, Indoneia is obliged to protect all works and related rights which related to copyright. Along with the ratification of Bern Convention, Indonesia also a member of Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (hereinafter TRIPs Agreement). According to TRIPs agreement, Indonesia as one of its member countries</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">have to harmonize regulatory standards regarding copyright protection in order to comply with the provisions in the TRIPs Agreement.<sup>29</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The protection of animated cartoon characters made by other countries shall be given considering the provisions stipulated in Article 2 point-c of the Copyright Law, which emphasizes the protection is given to “all Works and Related Rights products of Indonesian nationals, residents and legal entities, non-Indonesian nationals, nonIndonesian residents and non-Indonesian legal entities making their first Publication in Indonesia; and all Works and/or Related Rights products and users of Works and/or Related Rights products of non-Indonesian nationals, non-Indonesian residents, and non-Indonesian legal entities, provided that:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their State has a bilateral agreement with the Republic of Indonesia regarding the protection of Copyrights and Related Rights; or</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their State and the Republic of Indonesia are State parties to or Contracting States to the same multilateral agreement regarding the protection of Copyrights and Related Rights.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The obligation to protect any Creation or work in the form of drawings or any transformation shall be given by Indonesia to all creation or work of non-Indonesian national, non-Indonesian residents, and non-Indonesian legal entities. The protection is provided as the application of the principle of reciprocity, which is generally recognized in international law.<sup>30</sup> This principle is applied generally, hence all works and related rights from Indonesian national, residents and legal entities are also protected by other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The protection of animated cartoon is also given in fields of content in information and communication technology. According to Article 54 of Copyright Law, supervision, cooperation and coordination of each stakeholders is needed in order to prevent the infringement copyright and its related right in any form of media, especially in information and communication field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the abovementioned, it can be understood that animated cartoon characters are known as one of the objects of copyright protection. the protection is given automatically, which is known as automatically protection. Copyright owned by the Creator is an exclusive right, namely moral and economic rights. The period of protection of the Creation endures of the life of the Author and still protected for another 70 (seventy) years after the Author’s death. However, if copyright protection of the work is held by a legal entity, the protection is valid for 50 (fifty) years from the first publication.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The protection of Trademark is regulated under the Law No. 20 of 2016 concerning Marks and Geographical Indications (hereinafter referred to as Trademark Law). According to the provision of Article 1 point-1 of Trademark Law, it is stipulated that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Mark means any sign capable of being represented graphically in the form of drawings, logos, names, words, letters, numerals, colors arrangement, in 2 (two) and/or 3 (three) dimensional shape, sounds, holograms, or combination of 2 (two) or more of those elements to distinguish goods and/or services produced by a person or legal entity in trading goods and/or services.”</span></p>
