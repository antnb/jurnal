<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Abstract</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The government expects all health workers to be able to provide optimal quality health services without being forced into carrying out their duties and responsibilities, both in government and private hospital service facilities, independent clinics, and independent practice. When the general practitioner is unable to attend on a predetermined schedule, the replacement of medical services is replaced by an internship doctor. This study aims to analyze the legal norms and responsibilities of general practitioners who provide delegation to substitute doctors who are still with internsip program status if medical negligence occurs at an independent clinic. The research method used normative juridical with a conceptual and legal approach. There is still a void in the legal norms in the legislation regarding the duties and roles of internship doctors in replacing medical services in independent clinics. The responsibility of a general practitioner who delegates duties to a substitute doctor who is still in the internship program status is mandatory. Thus, if medical negligence occurs at an independent clinic caused by medical services performed by an internsip doctor, the general practitioner will also be responsible administratively, civilly, or criminally.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Health is a resource that all humans have and is not a life goal that needs to be achieved. Health does not focus on being physically fit but includes a healthy soul where individuals can be tolerant and can accept differences.<sup>1</sup>. The profession of a doctor or medicine is directly related to various important things in human life, namely health problems, life and death.<sup>2</sup>Its development in Indonesia, the medical profession is regulated in Law Number 29 of 2004 concerning Medical Practice (hereinafter referred</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">to as the Medical Practice Law). In article 1 point 11 which states that the medical profession is a job that is based on a science, competencies obtained through tiered education, and has a code of ethics that serves the wider community.<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The existence of a law and regulation in the health sector, so that all levels of society know that medical personnel or medical personnel are obliged to have a minimum qualification in the form of a STR (Registration Certificate) and SIP (Practice Permit) which are contained in the Medical Practice Law and Ministerial Regulations. Republic of Indonesia Health Number. 2052/MENKES/PER/X/2011 Concerning License to Practice and Implement Medical Practices (hereinafter referred to as PERMENKES License to Practice and Implement Medical Practices). The obligation of the Medical Intensive Program is carried out and regulated based on the Regulation of the Indonesian Medical Council Number 1/KKI/PER/I/2010 in article 2 concerning Registration of Doctors for the Internsip Program which reads that every doctor who will practice medicine independently in Indonesia must undergo an internsip program in order to obtain a rank the ability to practice independently. Internsip activities are carried out separately from medical education programs carried out by medical education institutions.<sup>4</sup>The medical internsip program is obliged to fulfill the requirements as stipulated in fulfilling medical practice by having to have an STR issued by the KKI (Indonesian Medical Council) which is written in KKI regulation Number 1/KKI/PER/I/2020 article 4 paragraph (1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The internsip doctor is all doctors who have been sworn in as doctors and have an internsip STR. The doctor's oath can be taken after the doctor has attended the learning process from the Doctor's Study Program which is KBK (Competency-Based Curriculum) and has passed the UKMPPD (Doctor Profession Program Student Competency Test) which will carry out medical practice to achieve proficiency and alignment between the results of education and practice in the field through an integrated, comprehensive, independent process, and using a family medicine approach. This internsip doctor activity carries out primary service activities, consultation and referrals, Scientific medical and non-medical activities are in accordance with the SKDI (Indonesian Doctor Competency Standards) which refers to the Medical Practice Law in order to create doctors who are professional and proficient in serving each patient. If the doctor is unable to attend on a predetermined schedule, the doctor can ask for a replacement with another doctor. This has been regulated in the Regulation of the Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia Number 2052/MENKES/PER/X/2011 concerning License to Practice and Implement Medical Practices (hereinafter referred to as PERMENKES License to Practice and Implement Medical Practices) Article 26 paragraph (3), (4), and (5).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jonathan Wibisono Tumali states that the internsip doctor has the same authority as general practitioners in general.<sup>5</sup>Internsip doctors also have a practice license which is</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">limited to internsip vehicles (one location), while general practitioners have three Practice Licenses with unlimited locations. Internsip doctors have their own authority to make medical decisions for patients, although sometimes if there are difficulties they are expected to consult with the supervising doctor. Internsip doctors have independent ethical, medical discipline and legal responsibility in the event of a medical error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rozi Kodarusman Warganedara states that clinical authority for Internsip Program participants of Indonesian doctors has not been clearly regulated or limited in the PMK for Implementing Internsip Programs, so that there are differences in the exercise of clinical authority by doctors at one hospital or health center in accordance with directions from the Medical Committee of the respective Hospital - respectively, which in general includes the implementation of medical procedures and health services. The form of legal protection for doctors participating in the Indonesian Doctor Internsip Program is preventive protection or prevention in the context of protecting doctor trainees as legal subjects before an offense occurs.<sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The urgency of this research was carried out because there is no law that regulates Interns Program Doctors as substitute doctors for general practitioners. This is because there is a legal vacuum regarding the rules for how long the doctor may be replaced. Therefore the author raises the title Responsibilities of General Practitioners in Employing Internsip Doctors in Independent Practices. The aims of this study are 1) to analyze the legal relationship between general practitioners and interns in the act of providing medical services; and 2) Analyzethe responsibility of general practitioners who employ internsip doctors in the event of medical negligence in independent practice.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The type of research used a normative juridical (Legal Research). The research approach used a statute approach and a conceptual approach. Sources of legal materials using 1) primary legal materials consist of basic norms or principles of the Preamble of the 1945 Constitution, basic regulations, jurisprudence, treaties, and the Criminal Code (KUHP), the Civil Code (KUHPerdata). 2) Secondary Legal Materials in the form of all legal publications that are not official documents. Publications on law include textbooks or literature, legal dictionaries, scientific legal journals, and comments on court decisions. 3) Tertiary Legal Materials in the form of books outside the science of law but still related to the legal issues being discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The technique for collecting legal materials was by accessing websites and journals that are published online related to the legal issues in this research. Data collection techniques in normative legal research are carried out by means of literature studies on legal materials, both primary legal materials, secondary legal materials, and tertiary legal materials. Methods of analysis of deductive legal material, namely stemming from a problem in general to matters of a special nature.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal Relations Between General Practitioners and Interns in Medical Services in Independent Practices</span></h3></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The purpose of holding an internsip programprovide opportunities for new doctors who have graduated from the competency-based Medical Education Study Program to apply and practice the competencies acquired during their education in order to align the results of education and practice in the field, in which these internsip doctors are given an opportunity or experience doing UKP (Individual Health Promotion) for 8 (eight) months, and SMEs (Community Health Efforts) for 4 (four) months<sup>7</sup>,In implementing the UPK program, an internsip doctor is required to carry out these activities by carrying out actions in the fields of Medical Cases, Surgical Cases, Emergency Cases, Psychiatric Cases, and Death Cases. Whereas in UKM an internsip doctor participant carries out these activities by carrying out the same actions at the UPK coupled with the Prevention and Management of Infectious / Non-communicable Diseases, Prevention and Management of Malnutrition and Stunting, Education on Environmental Sanitation (living environment, cleanliness in food processing and drinks,), Health promotion activities, Health Center Management, Disaster Management, Management of ordinary cases and extraordinary cases).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the internsip program, the internsip program doctor as a participant must prepare and present at least 5 (five) case reports in clinical meetings, namely 1 (one) case of ethical problems, 3 (three) interesting cases (such as medical cases, surgical cases, and emergency cases), and 1 (one) death case along with family data. All of this data is recorded in the intern participant's log book, at least every 3 months reported to and signed by the accompanying doctor.<sup>8</sup> The internship program is principally a form of pre-registration education which is an integral part of the KBK curriculum adaptation established by the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME). In KBK there are two types of medical education, basic education and further education. Basic education is carried out in FK and further education is an internship<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to R Soeroso, legal relations (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rechtbeterehkingen</span><span class="font1">) are two or morelegal subject. This legal relationship contains the rights and obligations of the party dealing with the rights and obligations of the other party.<sup>10</sup>The legal relationship between general practitioners and interns is not regulated in the Medical Practice Act, PMKLicense to Practice and Implement Medical Practices, and PMK for Internsip Program for</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Indonesian Doctors and Dentists. The relationship that occurs is between the relationship between the employer and the recipient of the work.A work agreement is an agreement made between a job recipient and an employer who has fulfilled a working condition, the rights and obligations of the parties are regulated in the Manpower Law in article 1 number 14, whereas in article 51 paragraph (1) of the Manpower Law it states that that the employment agreement is made verbally. The conditions stated legally in a work agreement generally must fulfill these elements, including: a. There is an agreement between the parties</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;The parties concerned have the ability or ability to act with legal force</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of an object of work that has been agreed, and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work that has been agreed upon is not contrary to public order, decency and applicable laws and regulations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">If it is related to the legal relationship between general practitioners and internsip doctors, then it cannot be said to be an agreement which does not fulfill one point of the four criteria above, namely the work that has been agreed upon violates the applicable laws and regulations. So a general practitioner's agreement with an internist cannot be said to be a work agreement based on law. So it cannot be an engagement between the parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Both general practitioners and interns are included in the health workforce. These health workers have rights and obligations in carrying out the practice which are regulated in Law Number 36 of 2014 concerning Health Personnel (hereinafter referred to as the Law on Health Personnel) in article 57 governing the Rights in carrying out the practice of health personnel, namely:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain legal protection as long as carrying out duties in accordance with professional standards, professional service standards, and standard operating procedures;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain complete and correct information from recipients of health services or their families;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receiving compensation for services;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain the protection of the principles of occupational safety and health, treatment that is in accordance with human dignity, morals, decency, and religious values;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get opportunities and develop their profession;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refuse the wishes of recipients of health services or other parties that conflict with professional standards, codes of ethics, service standards, standard operating procedures, or statutory provisions, and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain other rights in accordance with the provisions of the statutory regulations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to regulating rights, the Law on Health Personnel also regulates obligations in carrying out this practice as stated in Article 58 paragraph (1), namely:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing health services in accordance with professional standards, professional service standards, standard operating procedures, and professional ethics as well as the health needs of recipients of health services;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain approval from the recipient of health services or their family for the action to be given;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain the confidentiality of the health of recipients of health services;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make and keep records and or documents regarding examinations, care, and actions taken; And</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refer recipients of health services to other health workers who have the appropriate competence and authority.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The legal relationship between a general practitioner and an intern occurs when the internagreed to replace the general practitioner's duty. This agreement gives birth to an engagement or reimbursement agreement in which these parties demand rights and other parties fulfill these rights. In this agreement there are rights and obligations, the first is the right of the general practitioner, namely to ask for a replacement while the obligation is to provide compensation in exchange for replacement services, secondly, an internsip doctor has the obligation to be willing to replace the general practitioner in providing medical services, while his right is to receive compensation. substitute services and receive services from the general practitioner</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each legal provision has its own system that applies as a principle in that law. Likewise in contract law, which has the following principles:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principles of Consensuality</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The principle of consensualism or the principle of agreement is the principle which states that basically agreements and engagements arise and are born from the moment an agreement or agreement is reached. In essence, agreements can be made freely, not bound by form, and achieved not formally, but simply through mere consensus. <sup>11</sup></span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principle of Freedom of Contract</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The principle of freedom of contract is an agreement between the parties according to their will to make an agreement and each person is free to bind himself to whoever he wants, the parties can also freely determine the scope of the contents and requirements of an agreement provided that the agreement cannot conflict with statutory regulations. - invitations that are coercive, both public order and decency.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principle of Binding Strength (Pacta Sunt Servanda)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The principle of binding force is a contract made valid by the parties binding the parties in full according to the contents of the contract, binding the parties by law the power is equal to the increasing power of the law. This principle is stated in Article 1338 paragraph (1) of the Civil Code which reads all agreements made legally as laws for those who make them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principle of Good Faith</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">This principle of good faith can be found in the formulation of Article 1338 paragraph (3) of the Civil Code, which states that: &quot;Agreements must be implemented in good faith.&quot; According to J. Satrio the interpretation of good faith is that the agreement must be carried out in accordance with decency and propriety, because good faith is an abstract notion and even if one finally understands what is meant by good faith, it is still difficult for one to formulate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The principle of good faith has two meanings, namely subjective good faith and objective good faith. The principle of good faith in a subjective sense can be interpreted as an attitude of honesty and openness of a person in carrying out a legal act. Good faith in an objective sense means that an agreement made must be carried out by heeding the norms of decency and decency or the agreement is carried out according to what is deemed appropriate in society and justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The terms of an agreement are fundamental things that must be well known and understood. An agreement will be binding and valid if the agreement is legally made. In the following, we will discuss the requirements required by law for agreements to be valid. There are 4 (four) conditions for the validity of the agreement regulated in Article 1320 of the Civil Code, namely:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their agreement binds him</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In reaching an agreement or agreement in multiplying the agreement, both parties must have freedom of will.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to make an agreement</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The person making the agreement must be legally competent. In principle, every person is legally competent, except if he is incompetent by law.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain thing</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Based on Article 1332 to Article 1334 of the Civil Code, that an agreement must be about a certain matter, meaning that an agreement must have a certain object, what is promised or the goods intended in the agreement must at least determine the type and it is not an obstacle that the number of goods is not certain. , provided that the amount can then be determined or calculated.<sup>12</sup></span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halal reasons</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The fourth condition for the validity of an agreement regulated in Article 1335 to Article 1337 of the Civil Code is regarding a lawful cause. Related to this. According to Wirjono Prodjodikoro, he stated that it is impossible for an agreement to have no cause or cause, because the cause is actually the contents of the agreement and each agreement certainly has content.<sup>13</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The four conditions above absolutely must exist orabsolutely must be fulfilled in an agreement, therefore without one of these conditions the agreement cannot be implemented. If one of the subjective conditions is not met, then an agreement can be requested by one of the parties to be canceled. Meanwhile, if one of the objective conditions is not met, then an agreement is null and void, meaning that from the beginning it was considered that an agreement had never been born and there had never been an agreement. <sup>14</sup> Because in the relationship between a general practitioner and an internsip doctor, one subjective requirement is met, namely agreement and competence. However, it does not meet the objective requirements, namely regarding permissible causes / lawful causes. An internsip doctor is allowed to carry out medical practice actions in a designated vehicle, this is in accordance withPMK Implementation of Internsip ProgramArticle 6 paragraph (1) which states that the doctor's internsip program is carried out in the internsip facility(Hospitals and Health Centers), which have been determined by the Indonesian Internsip Doctors Committee (KIDI). The legal consequence that occurs is that the agreement between general practitioners and interns is null and void, which means that from the beginning it is considered that they have never entered into an agreement so that it does not result in an agreement.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>3.2 Responsibilities of General Practitioners Who Employ Internsip Doctors If Medical Negligence Occurs In Independent Practice</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Internship program participants are doctors who have just graduated from the competency-based Medical Education Program who will practice medicine and/or take specialist medical education. The distribution of Indonesian Physician Internship Program participants is regulated by the Indonesian Physician Internship Committee. Prior to running the Internship program, participants had passed the Indonesian Doctor Competency Test (UKDI), and had a Registration Certificate (STR) for Internship Authority and Internship Practice Permit (SIP).<sup>15</sup> The implementation of the Internship Program by the Indonesian Physician Internship Committee in collaboration with new Doctor Placement stakeholders in the Internship program vehicle is carried out by KIDI in collaboration with the Provincial KIDI and in coordination with the District/City Provincial Health Office.<sup>16</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By law, anyone who causes or causes harm to another person is required to be responsible for all such losses. Likewise with doctors, as health workers who have provided health services (medical action) to patients, in the case of doctors causing harm with these services, they are obliged to provide accountability. The responsibility of doctors who commit malpractice can be viewed from 3 (three) aspects, namely from a civil, criminal and administrative perspective.<sup>17</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Doctor's responsibilityInternsip doctors </span><span class="font2">in the event of medical negligence in independent practice consist of administrative, civil and criminal responsibilities. Administrative responsibilities related to k</span><span class="font1">This has to do with administrative punishment, namely the revocation of a license to practice if carrying out medical services not in accordance with professional standards is also specifically regulated. Another legal responsibility of doctors is responsibility in the realm of administrative law which is indeed different from administrative punishment. Provisions regarding this administrative law can be seen in article 69 which regulates: Honorary Council of Indonesian Medical Disciplines. In this article it is stated that: 1) The decision of the Indonesian Medical Discipline Honorary Council is binding on doctors; 2) the form can be in the form of being declared innocent or imposing disciplinary sanctions; and 3) the sanction may be in the form of giving a written warning, recommending the revocation of a registration certificate or practice license,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the Medical Practice Act Article 69 paragraph (1) which states that MKDKI decisions bind doctors and dentists, and KKI which can be in the form of declaring innocence or imposing disciplinary sanctions. Disciplinary sanctions can be in the form of giving written warnings, recommending revocation of STR or SIP, and/or</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">participating in education or training at medical or dental educational institutions. Article 64 of the Medical Practice Law states that the Indonesian Medical Discipline Honorary Council (MKDKI) receives complaints and has the authority to examine and decide whether there was a mistake by a doctor for violating the application of medical disciplines and imposing sanctions. If it turns out that a violation of medical discipline is found, the MKDKI will forward the complaint to the professional organization (IDI), then the IDI will take action against the doctor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Civil liability is explained in the context of a general practitioner who employs an internsip doctor, the general practitioner is subject to vicarious liability, that is, there is a replacement liability that is imposed on the party responsible for someone for the actions taken by the party who is their responsibility. This vicarious liability is regulated in Article 1367 of the Civil Code which states that &quot;a person is not only responsible for losses caused by his own actions, but also for losses caused by the actions of people who are his dependents or caused by goods under his control.&quot; ”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Article 1368 of the Civil Code states that those who can be held accountable for the behavior of other people are employers, and people who appoint other people to represent their affairs, towards their subordinates in carrying out the work assigned to them. vicarious liability can be used in determining the party who is responsible or receiving compensation for acts against the law. However, there are limitations in imposing liability on the basis of vicarious liability. This limitation is regulated in article 1367 paragraph (5) of the Civil Code which states that the responsibility ends when the person concerned can prove. In the Health Law that every person has the right to compensation due to errors or negligence by health workers, this compensation is carried out in applicable legislation, this regulation refers to the Civil Code (KUHPer) or Burgerlijk Wetboek (BW). Even though an internsip doctor performs medical practice on a patient, the general practitioner who employs him still accepts the imposition of responsibility based on vicarious liability. In terms of civil liability, general practitioners who employ internsip doctors can be asked for compensation as regulated in Article 1367 of the Civil Code.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Criminal responsibility explained </span><span class="font1">Medical negligence or what is often referred to as malpractice is an intentional or unintentional error or omission by medical personnel which causes harm to the patient's health and safety. Malpractice also greatly deviates from Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), medical code of ethics, and medical professional standards because every medical staff is obliged to provide the best service to patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The relationship between medical risk and medical negligence is an accident that results in an action being taken by a health worker in accordance with applicable medical procedures, capabilities and ethical standards. All types of medical actions carry risks, and no matter how small a medical procedure is, there will always be risks. Therefore, in an action that will be given to patients by doctors or health workers there is always a risk (inherent risk of treatment). If a doctor or health worker carefully carries out a medical action by giving permission to the patient and in accordance with medical service standards but then the risk still occurs, the doctor or other health worker cannot</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">be completely blamed. It is on this basis that all medical actions must go through the patient's consent. <sup>18</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the case above, it is the responsibility of general practitioners who employ internsip doctors if medical negligence occurs in independent practice, general practitioners can be held criminally responsible. Criminal responsibility can be imposed on Employers General Practitioners contained in Article 80 namely in Article 80 of the Medical Practice Law. In that article it is said that anyone who intentionally employs a doctor or dentist as referred to in Article 42, shall be punished with imprisonment for a maximum of 10 (ten) years or a fine of up to Rp. 300,000,000.00 (three hundred million rupiahs).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the above case general practitioners and internsip doctors can be sued in civil terms with the details of the general practitioner being sued as the owner of an independent practice place and as an employer, while internsip doctors can be sued in civil terms because the doctor is the recipient of work and the doctor practices medicine and administering drugs to patients that cause side effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even though an internsip doctor performs medical practice on a patient, the general practitioner who employs him still accepts the imposition of responsibility based on vicarious liability. In terms of civil liability, general practitioners who employ internsip doctors can be asked for compensation as regulated in Article 1367 of the Civil Code.

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>4. Conclusion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the results of data analysis explaining several conclusions, namely 1) </span><span class="font1">The legal relationship between general practitioners and interns began to form when there was an agreement that the intern would replace the general practitioner. The agreement cannot become an agreement because it does not meet the objective requirements, namely the reasons that are permitted. Based on Article 40 of the Medical Practice Law, a doctor who is unable to practice must appoint a replacement doctor and must make a notification. Internsip doctors are not suitable to be substitute doctors on duty because they only have an Internsip STR and SIP where their authority as a doctor is only limited to internsips; 2) General practitioners who employ internsip doctors can be held liable in criminal, civil and administrative terms. Article 80 of the Medical Practice Law states that anyone who intentionally employs a doctor or dentist who does not yet have an STR and SIP can be punished with imprisonment for a maximum of 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(ten) years or a fine of up to Rp. 300,000,000.00 (three hundred million). rupiah) Civil liability can be borne by general practitioners as employers based on Article 1367 of the Civil Code regarding vicarious liability and can be subject to requests for compensation in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Administrative responsibilities can also be borne by general practitioners with the condition that there are complaints from patients in writing that are reported to MKDKI then MKDKI will impose disciplinary sanctions on general practitioners and internsip doctors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recommendations that can be given include 1) Giving administrative sanctions to internsip doctors who, if they carry out medical practices outside the intern facility; 2) 2. Ensuring Doctor Internsip Rights related to Basic Living Expenses Assistance, Transportation, and/or Allowances, Housing Facilities, Health Insurance and Employment in Law No. 39 of 2017 concerning the Implementation of Indonesian Physician and Dentist Internsip Programs are fulfilled and given on time .</span></p>
