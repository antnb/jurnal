CVPDr is a DNA fragment that indicates that plants are resistant to CVPD Previous research using primers that amplified 841 bp CVPDr fragment was able to amplify the fragment from Triphasia trifolia that considers being a resistant plant Citrus aurantifolia var seedless which considers being a tolerant plant and some susceptible citrus plants to CVPD disease In this study we designed some primers that amplified only CVPDr DNA fragment from T trifolia which c
