Objectives Traumatic brain injury TBI is accompanied by regional alterations of brain metabolism reduction in metabolic rates and possible energy crisis This metabolic disturbance reflected by increase and accumulation of the brain lactate levels Objective of this study was to determine the correlation between abnormalities in lactate metabolism for predicting neurologic outcome after moderate or severe traumatic brain injury Methods An observational prospe
