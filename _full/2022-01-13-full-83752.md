Rarit is one of the traditional food products typical of the island of Lombok in the form of sliced meat seasoned with tamarind salt and sugar and then dried This research was conducted to determine the physicochemical and organoleptic properties of beef ribs using different types of sugar In this study the experimental design used was a completely randomized design CRD with four treatments and four replications in order to obtain 16 experimental units T
