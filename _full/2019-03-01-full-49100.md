<p><span class="font1">Abstract Today, with the advancement of globalization, it is essential to clarify how the local communities are changing from a viewpoint of comparative sociology, in order to evaluate the changes in the modern society from a broader point of view. This paper attempts to make a preliminary, comparative consideration between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> in Japan and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> in Bali. The results revealed the following: 1) local communities have always been placed in a top-down government framework through history; 2) yet, it demonstrates, from time to time in history, a dynamism rooted in the native social theory and customs; and 3) after all, local communities have reached a critical phase in the modern, post-colonial stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Keywords: community, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1">, comparative sociology</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">was inseparable with sedentarism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With the recent advancement of globalism, however, the concept of community, which holds a premise of settlement and considers itself as a system of people’s interactions and sentiment/consciousness rooted in a specific territory, is increasingly being questioned. At the very least, such a concept of the community has lost its reality. A borderless flow of people, things, matters, and information has widely generated societies beyond any national society. This has resulted in the eroding of the substantial foundation of the community, rooted in territoriality where de-territorialization of social life and social relationships progress. Now, the border between moving and settling has become ambiguous, and the local community based on territoriality has shifted back in the society, and instead, a networked community, which is rooted in borderless interactions among people, has emerged to the foreground of society. This point will be discussed in detail in a separate paper, but in any case, it is certain that the concept of community is under question today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This paper aims to illustrate where the existing base lies in today's societies, and how such possibilities can be disclosed through a comparative case study between two nations/societies – Japan and Bali. Here, as a preliminary consideration, the focus is given specifically to an overview and historical changes of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> (block association) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">honaikai</span><span class="font1"> as a “modern community”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Let us begin by looking at </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> in Japan. Most Japanese, at least until now, have commonly associated community with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1">. In fact, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> exists in any municipality and is widely acknowledged. The existence of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> is also known among foreign researchers with interests in Japan. By the way, Pekkanen, who has been conducting research on Japanese society, refers to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> as an organization which consists of the residents of a community within a specific border and engages in a variety of activities relevant to that community (Pekkanen, 2006). In addition, for Berque, well-versed with Japanese culture, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai </span><span class="font1">embodies the firmness of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chien</span><span class="font1"> (regional ties) in the modern Japanese society and there is the “community of the day” (Berque, 1986). Positively or negatively, it seems that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> is viewed as something that carries the unique characteristics of Japanese society and culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For people in the West, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> is something of a substantially different nature that is not based on voluntary membership. Any group that &quot;you automatically become a member just by residing in a specific area, without clearly indicating your will to join or otherwise&quot; is unimaginable or improbable. For this reason, it was often disrespected as representing grassroots conservatism. On the contrary, there has arisen a standpoint which tries to see the possibility of a topological relationship of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chien</span><span class="font1"> (neighbors), as Berque did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By the way, it is not necessarily the case that there is a consensus on how to grasp </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai,</span><span class="font1"> even in Japan. This reminds us that there was an intense discussion around whether to see </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> as a form of a culture or a legacy of feudalism (Yoshihara, 2000). This was the so-called &quot;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai </span><span class="font1">controversy,” which dominated in the academia of sociology in the 1950s, although such an attempt to grasp </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> structurally has not been actively made since then. Instead, a certain number of studies which analyzed it from its functional point of view have been accumulated. Under such circumstances, it is the most commonly accepted definition of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> to seize it from the following five points, namely 1) exclusive locality, that is, a specific area; 2) membership by household; 3) participation by all households; 4) having an integrative function; and 5) representing the locality. These five characteristics of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> emphasized by this view are partly compatible with the three conditions that Bell and Newby (1976) point out, indicating that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai </span><span class="font1">represents the de facto community, or more precisely, the local community.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Let us next look at </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1">. Banjar is the base of Balinese society and can be compared with the above-mentioned </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1">. Strictly speaking, it is a hamlet, but considered here as an equivalent of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">RT</span><span class="font1">/</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">RW</span><span class="font1"> (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai/tonarigumi</span><span class="font1">) lying at the base of Javanese society and, therefore, represents one form of the local community. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Banjar</span><span class="font1"> is central to the “pluralistic collectivism” as Geertz describes (Geertz, 1963, p.85). Warren also mentions that: Everyday life in the villages of South Bali is through these intersecting but semi-autonomous corporate units of a special purpose character: the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> is the civic community; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">subak</span><span class="font1"> (agricultural associations) organize irrigation and other aspects of farming which require common co-ordination; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dadia</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">soroh</span><span class="font1"> is a kin-group based on descent through the male line; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pemaksan</span><span class="font1"> (temple support groups) are responsible for the maintenance of village shrines and the organization of much of local ritual beyond the life cycle and ancestral ceremonies of family and kin-groups; and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">seka</span><span class="font1"> include clubs and voluntary work-groups formed to do just about anything else. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Banjar</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pemaksan</span><span class="font1">, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">seka</span><span class="font1"> usually draw their memberships from within the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1">, while </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">subak</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dadia</span><span class="font1"> memberships frequently cross-cut it. The result is a complicated, nevertheless highly structured, arrangement of overlapping but non-coordinate corporate groups... (Warren, 1993, pp.7-8).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As understood from here, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> itself is a form of the local community and intersects with a number of institutions and organizations (that is, a networked community, is described with the term already used in this paper) which carry a specific function in everyday life. It belongs under </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1"> (village) through people. But </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> clearly differs from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> in Japan or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">RT/RW</span><span class="font1"> in Java, in terms of taking the two-layered structure, consisting of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">adat </span><span class="font1">(local customary unit) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dinas</span><span class="font1"> (government unit).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Today, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> is placed at the lowest of the multi-layered hierarchical system covering the state to neighborhood levels. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desa</span><span class="font1"> (village), the immediate upper tier, consists of two-layers: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa adat</span><span class="font1"> (local customary village), which deals with a series of courteous and symbolic matters, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa dinas</span><span class="font1"> (government village), which administers public affairs. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Banjar</span><span class="font1">, the lower tier of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1">, also takes two layers, namely </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar adat</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar dinas. </span><span class="font1">Although this differentiation between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">adat</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dinas </span><span class="font1">can be traced as far back as when the island of Bali as a whole was placed under Dutch colonial rule (i.e.1906~1907). According to Kagami (2000), it was only in 1979 when these were clearly institutionalized under the Desa Administrative Law. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> originally acts on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font1"> (basic regulation) which is based on the Balinese Hindu dogma. The process of institutionalization, including this point, will be discussed in the next chapter. Here, it should be pointed out that the above-mentioned two-layered structure richly praises the cosmology of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1">, by maintaining the state of &quot;pluralistic collectivism.&quot; That is to say, this cosmology is very characteristic of the Balinese community. In the next chapter, the preliminary sketches of the history and origins of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> described above will be looked at in more detail.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prehistory of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chonaikai</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> is a typical local resident organization/local community which emerged with the development of the modern Japanese society. There are a number of views as to where to place the prototype of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1">, but it is certain that it has long prehistory as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rimpo seido</span><span class="font1"> (neighborhood system) in premodern times. Here, the prehistory of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> will be overviewed according to “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Preliminary Study of the Neighborhood Associations of Japan,”</span><span class="font1"> a special report written by Analysis and Research Division of the Civil Information and Education Section, GHQ, in January 1948 under the American Occupation (GHQ/SCAP, CIE 1948).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to this report, the prehistory can be divided into two phases: namely 1) the introduction of the five-man neighborhood association system at the time of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Taika</span><span class="font1"> Reform, and 2) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">goningumi </span><span class="font1">(five-man group) as a local administrative organ in feudal Japan of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tokugawa era</span><span class="font1">. In the first phase, the primordium is seen as the introduction of the five-man neighbourhood association consisting of five households at the time of the Taika Reform (of 645 CE), following the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ho</span><span class="font1"> system in China during the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tnag</span><span class="font1"> Dynasty (618-907 CE), which was then institutionalized by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Taiho Ritsuryo</span><span class="font1"> (Taiho Ordinance) in 701CE and by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yoro Ritsuryo</span><span class="font1"> (Yoro Code) in 718CE. Under this institutionalization, the functions of the neighborhood association were established as maintaining order, collective economic responsibility, and mutual aid. The system of neighborhood association did not penetrate the entire society, despite the multiple efforts of law amendments and expansion of the scope of the laws to ensure the smooth execution of the above functions. Rather, the five-man neighborhood association as an institution began to decline in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Heian</span><span class="font1"> period (from 794 to 1185 CE), and have completely faded by the middle of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Heian</span><span class="font1"> period. In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kamakura</span><span class="font1"> period (from 1185 to 1333 CE), the five-man neighborhood association became just a name only as various institutions of the samurai class were being formed (and these will be institutionalized as “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Buke Myomokusho”</span><span class="font1"> in the later </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edo</span><span class="font1"> period). On the other hand, a movement of collectivization of neighbors traced from the concept “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ho</span><span class="font1">” sustained as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cho</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">machi</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The signs of the revival of the five-man group emerged as a way to, especially, deal with lawlessness and riots at the end of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Muromachi</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">period. It was established as an institution to maintain the feudal order as a result of shoring up by the government for the purpose of prohibiting Christianity, policing of vagrants, especially a master-less samurai, on the rise, and ensuring the levying of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nengu</span><span class="font1"> (tax) gradually becoming a heavier burden during the third </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shogun</span><span class="font1">, Iyemitsu, of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tokugawa</span><span class="font1"> era. It was under such circumstances, that the second phase mentioned earlier emerged. With the stabilization of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bakuhan taisei</span><span class="font1"> (the shogunate), the function of the “five-man group” initially anticipated for maintenance of the peace and was gradually shifted to normative and economic aspects so that the rules and pledges of the five-man groups came to cover almost all domains of everyday life. In any case, the five-man groups have become a responsible, local administrative unit and basic cooperative organization of the local residents throughout the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tokugawa</span><span class="font1"> period.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Birth of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> and the Process of State Control</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rimpo</span><span class="font1"> organization overviewed above was the “prototype” of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1">, but it did not directly lead to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1">. The functions of the “five-man groups” were eradicated during the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Meiji</span><span class="font1"> Restoration (from 1867 to 1889). This was dictated by the delivery of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">shisei-chosonsei</span><span class="font1"> (the reorganization of cities, towns, villages) in 1888. The nature of the “five-man group” as an administrative institution was completely lost by this time. The “five-man groups” were separated from administration and sustained as neighborhood mutual-aid organizations where the residents help each other. It was not until 1908, even after the Russo-Japanese War of 19041905</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font1"> (when the revival of the five-man group, once withdrew from the center stage of the history, was mentioned in the imperial ordinance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boshin Shosho),</span><span class="font1"> that the “five-man group” came back to life in a public sphere as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1">. By the way, one of the initial catalysts for the emergence of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> in Tokyo was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jikeidan</span><span class="font1"> (civil defense group) that was widely organized in line with the intention of the military and police after the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kanto</span><span class="font1"> Earthquake. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jikeidan</span><span class="font1"> was ordered to dissolve later, as it was held responsible for the massacre of the Koreans (Matsuo, 2003), and it is known that some had been absorbed into </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> at the time of dissolution, depending on the areas. Nonetheless, it is during the period of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">noson keizaikosei undo</span><span class="font1"> (the campaign for the renovation of the village economy) after the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Showa </span><span class="font1">Depression, followed by the outbreak of the China Incident, that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> emerged as an administrative layer. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> was formed to mutually help each other against the impoverishment of the agrarian villages as well as to back up the warfare from grassroot levels. Most of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> in the old city area of pre-war Tokyo and agricultural suburbs were said to be established during this period (Tokyo City, 1934).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With the intensification of the Total War System, henceforth, the state control over </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai </span><span class="font1">was strengthened. The direct reason for that can be seen in various national planning with regards to the reform of local municipalities, with its beginning owing to the amendments of prefectural, municipal, and town and village systems. All these plans failed, however, and organization of the national system resulted by the proclamation of the Instruction No.17 by the Ministry of the Home Affairs on September 11, 1940. Furthermore, various instructions issued by the Local Bureau of the Home Ministry were delivered to municipalities, wards, towns, and villages, then finally to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> via </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jokai</span><span class="font1">. As such, the state control over </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> reached the highest degree, making </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> a semi-administrative body which deals with difficulties of the home-front and was responsible for rationing of daily necessities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the war, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> was dissolved by the Potsdam Cabinet Order No.15 in May 1947, because of its undemocratic nature and especially for its responsibility to support warfare at the basic levels of society. But it remained in effect in many of the areas by changing its name<sup>1)</sup> (Yoshihara, 1989). This is how </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> has seamlessly sustained itself to this day after its arrival in modernity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As looked at here, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> as a local community has been consistently placed within the “top-down” government framework from time of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rimpo seido</span><span class="font1">/five-man groups from prehistory to the present. At the same time, it cannot be denied that it has occasionally played the role of &quot;sharing of lives&quot; among the people in history. In fact, after the decline of the social control function through a long conflict, there have often been cases where the function of mutual-aid would emerge to the forefront of the society. On the whole, therefore, it is not wrong to grasp </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> in the context of &quot;top-down&quot; control, but it must not be forgotten that it had sustained the flexibility owing to the fact that it had not necessarily been framed within the local institutions.</span></p>

There appeared a contradicting relationship where the old </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1">, based on tradition of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa pakraman, </span><span class="font1">and the new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1">, an administrative village, exist in parallel. The former then became to be called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa adat</span><span class="font1"> (local customary village).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In any case, today, the two-layered structure of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa adat</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa dinas</span><span class="font1"> apparent in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1"> level all over Bali was derived from the preparation of the lowest organizations which was conducted in line with the establishment of the upper bodies under the colonial rule. The colonial government, by the way, prescribed people to comply with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">adat</span><span class="font1"> (custom) separately from their own country’s local government laws, but it was virtually just inserting some of the rules of the Dutch local government laws into a culmination of the customary law within the relevant areas<sup>3)</sup>. Thus, the origin of the administrative village was unlocked, but in reality, it was sustained in a number of areas for a long period of time even after independence in 1950.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is only in 1979 when this administrative village came to an end. The Village Government Law (UU No.5 Tahun 1979 tentang Pemerintahan Desa) delivered that year made </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1"> as a national administrative organization substituting the administrative village. Here, while customs of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa </span><span class="font1">are being approved of, it was set that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1"> consist of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kepala desa</span><span class="font1"> (head of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa) and Lembaga Musyawarah Desa</span><span class="font1"> (LMD: Village Consultative Council) anywhere in Indonesia. In Bali, however, the Village Government Law, with its preamble stating its goal to protect the diversity of the village forms and the local customs, rather promoted the movement where the development of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa adat</span><span class="font1"> was actively sought. Further, the State Ordinance regarding Locality, Function, and Roles of the Customary Villages as Social Units in the Customary Law in Bali (Peraturan Daerah Propinsi Daerah Tingkat I Bali no.6 Tahun 1986 tentang Kedudukan, Fungsi dan Peranan Desa Adat Sebagai Kesatuan Masyarakat Hukum Adat Dalam Propinsi Daerah Tingkat I Bali), delivered in 1986, actually gave legal authorization to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa adat</span><span class="font1">. The Local Government Law (UU No.22 Tahun 1999 tentang Pemerintahan Daerah), delivered in 1999, later dictated the establishment of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa adat</span><span class="font1"> as an autonomous selfgoverning organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">b. Institutionalising </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Banjar</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">As mentioned earlier, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1"> exist together, but it is not clear either when </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> was established or what the prototype of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> is, other than that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> was originally used to express the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">assembly of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">karang</span><span class="font1"> (residential compound). It was upon the delivery of the Village Government Law in 1979, mentioned earlier when </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> was clearly positioned within the institutional frame. As shown in Figure 1, the Village Government Law “establish[es] a multi-tiered administrative hierarchy from the neighborhood through provincial level[s]&quot; (Warren 1993, p.239). Thus, the two-layered structure of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dinas</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">adat</span><span class="font1"> was institutionalized under </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1">/</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lingkungan</span><span class="font1"> (the subdivision of non-autonomous villages), the lower tier of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1">/</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kelurahan</span><span class="font1"> (the non-autonomous village). It also mentions detailed rules for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kepala desa</span><span class="font1"> and refers to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar dinas</span><span class="font1"> (that is, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dusun</span><span class="font1">), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar adat, and kepala lingkungan</span><span class="font1"> (head of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lingkungan</span><span class="font1">). </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kepala dusun</span><span class="font0">(</span><span class="font1">head of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dusun</span><span class="font0">)</span><span class="font1">is appointed by a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">camat</span><span class="font0">(</span><span class="font1">a district head</span><span class="font0">)</span><span class="font1">and has become a public servant submitting to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kepala desa</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For several years immediately after the enactment of the Village Government Law, however, the position of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kepala dusun</span><span class="font1"> remained unfilled in most </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1">. This was largely influenced by insufficient national budget to meet the sudden increase of salary required for the appointment of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kepala dusun</span><span class="font1">, in addition to the confusion by the enactment of the Law on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1">-side. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gubernur</span><span class="font1"> (governor) of Bali state enacted a state ordinance regarding </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa pakraman</span><span class="font1"> in 2001, promoting </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> to appoint </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kepala dusun</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Banjar, </span><span class="font1">without </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kepala dusun,</span><span class="font1"> thus decreased, establishing the two-tier structure of “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dinas-adat</span><span class="font1">” and “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dusun-banjar</span><span class="font1">.” If given a thought, the two-tier structure of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> corresponds to that of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1"> through the enactment of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">adat</span><span class="font1"> and the internalization, institutionalization, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dinas</span><span class="font1">-ation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1">. This itself is considered to represent the institutional reform at the bottom of the abovementioned “multitiered administrative hierarchy.” In this view, it was considered that institutional reform occurred at the appropriate time during the post-colonial phase through decentralization/democratic system after the dictatorship during the development period, not during the colonial phase, where a unique social principle/</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">adat</span><span class="font1"> (which has been placed deep inside </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1">) was either “displaced to the other side” or “relegated to the edge.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXISTING FORMS OF C</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">HONAIKAI</span><span class="font1"> AND </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">BANJAR</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condescending Eyes</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Through the historical development of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1">, as looked at in parallel above, what emerges in common is that both have always been exposed to condescending eyes. Furthermore, the direction of eyes is towards &quot;the social,&quot; which have been uniquely held deep inside local communities. These were symbolized in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rinpo seido</span><span class="font1"> (system of the neighborhood association) for</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> and in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gotong royong</span><span class="font1"> (mutual aid) for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1">, respectively. Interestingly, these were once dis-embedded in the modern/post-colonial context, then re-embedded later. We can read off the persistent pattern of historical adoptions of local communities based on administrative reasons. In another view, this suggests that the local communities hold a type of dynamism which has sustained through history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The labeling of communities with words, such as &quot;too old&quot; or &quot;too traditional,&quot; is used to describe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> today. However, this does not necessarily deny the dynamism mentioned above. In this view, it is worthwhile to note a passionate gaze being given to the dynamism hidden in the traditional event of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1">, as symbolically seen in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ajeg Bali</span><span class="font1"> (Bali revival movement). Yet, it is necessary to carefully look at how these dynamisms are caught up in the historical phases.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historical Phases of the Dynamism</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In searching the historical phases, the effect of globalization, and especially of global tourism, cannot be ignored. In Japan, interests in security issues have grown as a result of the increase in inbound tourists, and the local communities are being made responsible for this purpose. For example, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> are being reformed as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tonarigumi</span><span class="font1"> for disaster prevention purposes. Within this movement, intentions can be seen to utilize the human resources and networks, which have fostered “sharing of lives,” serving as the basis of such dynamism. Integrating such intrinsic resources hidden in the local communities can act to seize the locality to promote further globalization on the whole<sup>4)</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the contrary, in Bali, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">adat</span><span class="font1"> in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bajar</span><span class="font1"> and rituals and ceremonies associated with it are becoming resources for tourism, losing their original meaning/symbolic systems, as Bali establishes itself as a global brand. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ajeg Bali</span><span class="font1"> discussed earlier, is also increasingly exposed to secularization brought by global tourism. The dynamism shown at the bottom tier of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> is considered high for its instrumental utility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Again, in the trend looked at above, it should be noted that the weakening of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> in Japan and losing the meaning of the two-layered structure of ‘</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">adat-dinas</span><span class="font1">’ and ‘</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dusun-banjar</span><span class="font1">’ in Bali are unavoidable. Regardless of the details, this is causing the breakdown of the dynamism which has supported the local community from the foundation. Ironically, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> is following the path to collapse as more top-down leverages are implemented in Japan, and the promotion and revival of policy for the customary culture, led by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the governor</span><span class="font1"> as decentralization progresses, and are resulting in the weakening of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa adat,</span><span class="font1"> rather than strengthening it in Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In any case, both </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banjar</span><span class="font1"> are</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">standing at the crossroad of global changes. There is also a view of these dynamisms from traditional communitarianism. If this position is taken too far to the front, however, there is a risk of missing the “presence” of the local communities by closing the eyes on the historical phases of the dynamism.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">VI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUDING REMARKS</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">This paper placed the point of discussion on where the existing base of today's community stands and how its possibilities are opened through a case study of two nations/societies: Japan and Bali. As it became clear in the discussion above, the discussion did not necessarily go into depth on the agenda itself. Rather, it only gave a preliminary view regarding the issue. It may be more appropriate to say that it posed several points of discussion to research fuller. Yet, this paper revealed the following three points: 1) local communities have always been placed in the top-down government framework through at history; 2) yet, it demonstrates, from time to time in history, a dynamism rooted in the native customs of Japanese and Balinese culture; and 3) after all, the local community in each culture have reached a critical phase in the modern/post-colonial stage. These conclusions are just a preliminary attempt at researching this area. Each of these points should be closely examined in the following papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The main purpose of the next paper would be to clarify the existing forms of the community from the theoretical horizon of comparative sociology. Specifically, case studies from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> in a suburb of Tokyo area and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bajar</span><span class="font1"> in an inner area of metropolitan Denpasar will be looked at to illustrate a whole picture of the communities, including not only local but also networked communities, and their active dynamism. At the same time, the structural characteristics overshadowing the two societies should also be revealed. Finally, then, a trial to bring a paradigm shift to the communities would be considered through a discussion of the findings. This paper, in any case, outlined the first step towards such an agenda-setting research project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Note:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chonaikai</span><span class="font1"> was born one after another, just as “bamboo shoots after rain,” soon after the Potsdom Decree. This means that they, in reality, existed even under its ban.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desa</span><span class="font1"> was originally derived from the Sanskrit, with the meaning of “place” or “reference.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Diantha, the reaching horizon of the rural policy under the colonial administration can be found in the Native Government Ordinance (Staatblad 1906 &nbsp;No.83 tentang</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Inlandsche Gemeente Ordonantie) of 1906, and the Outer territory-Native Government Ordinance (Staatblad 1938 &nbsp;No.490 tentang</span></p>
