<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstrak</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Penggunaan kata-kata umpatan oleh seseorang atau kelompok sudah sering kita dengar dalam suatu percakapan. Penggunaan kata-kata umpatan pada umumnya tidak diperkenankan dalam sebuah percakapan karena kata-kata umpatan tersebut oleh sebagian besar orang dianggap sebagai kata-kata tabu yang jika digunakan bisa menimbulkan kesan buruk terhadap si pembicara maupun lawan bicara. Dalam situasi informal, kata-kata umpatan biasanya digunakan oleh seseorang untuk mengekpresikan perasaan, meluapkan emosi, bahkan kata-kata umpatan sering digunakan untuk menyakiti perasaan seseorang. Tetapi, tidak semua kata-kata umpatan digunakan untuk hal-hal yang tidak layak karena bagi kelompok-kelompok tertentu kata-kata umpatan tersebut digunakan sebagai alat atau cara untuk menjaga dan meningkatkan solidaritas di antara para pengguna dan sekaligus sebagai penunjuk identitas sebuah grup atau kelompok tertentu. Sumber data yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah percakapan-percakapan yang dituangkan ke dalam sebuah skrip film yang berjudul “Casino”. Adapun tujuan dalam penelitian ini ialah untuk mengetahui fenomena kata-kata umpatan berdasarkan teori para ahli yakni, teori yang diusulkan oleh Hughes dan teori yang diusulkan oleh Liedlich. Setelah melakukan analisis, kata-kata umpatan yang ditemukan memiliki kategorinya masing-masing dan kata-kata umpatan yang digunakan oleh si pembicara memiliki tujuan dan fungsi yang berbeda dalam konteks tertentu. Selain itu, dalam sejarahnya kata-kata umpatan biasanya digunakan oleh kaum sosial rendah seperti pekerja dan buruh, tetapi kata-kata umpatan yang ditemukan di dalam skrip film Casino, lebih banyak digunakan oleh kaum sosial yang lebih tinggi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kata Kunci: kata-kata umpatan, kata-kata tabu, perkataan tidak senonoh.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of the Study</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Swear words are unique phenomenon. On one hand, to most people swearing words are taboo words whose usages are prohibited to be spoken or used in a conversation because it can create shock, offensiveness, and social norm violation in the society, on the other hand, to some people those words are used as a way to express emotion and feeling, as a means of enhancing group’s solidarity, even those words are used as their habit in everyday life. </span><span class="font1">According to Jay (1992) swearing is the use of taboo language with the purpose of expressing the speaker's emotional state and communicating that information to the listener. In expressing it, the speaker usually uses verbal obscenity. Nowadays, swear words are more accepted</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">by the society. </span><span class="font0">As applied in our daily conversation, swear words are also being used in the movie script. Many movie scripts use swear words in the dialogue, for example, in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Casino</span><span class="font0"> movie script. The Casino movie script was chosen because it contains a lot of non-standard and informal English words. This paper is entitled “</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Swearing in the Casino Movie Script</span><span class="font0">”. This study is mainly focused on the existence of swear words in the English Language.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Liedlich (1973) stated the principal purposes of verbal obscenity are to provide catharsis, to create attention, to discredit, to provoke violent confrontation, to show personal identification, and as term of endearment. In addition, Hughes (1991) stated that most people use swear words used to insult others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Liedlich (1973) stated that to gain attention by using passionate language whose connotations cause an emotional response in the listener. People who use swear words want to attract attention and they want to be the central attention among others. In this case, Ginger comes to Nicky to ask a help. When she is talking to Nicky,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fuckin</span><span class="font0">” is used by Ginger. It attracts Nicky’s attention. By this word she wants telling Nicky that she really needs a help. She wants Nicky to see her condition. After hearing that Nicky promised to help her to find her a sponsor.</span></p>

That prick's been dodging me for three weeks </span><span class="font0">(3.3.1 data 3)</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">According to Liedlich when people use verbal obscenity to discredit it means they use it to express their dislike about something.

<p><span class="font0">In formal situation, “</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">asshole</span><span class="font0">” is replaced with “</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">anus</span><span class="font0">” when it refers to human anatomy. However, when it is used in the informal or impolite situation, this word is usually used by the speakers to express the speaker’s emotion. </span><span class="font1">In this case, Ace told Sherbert to tell Cowboy to take his feet off the table. When Sherbert tried to tell Cowboy to take his feet off the table, Cowboy did not care and ignored him. Sherbert is upset with Cowboy. He returned to Ace and said “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fuckin' asshole won’t budge</span><span class="font1">”.
