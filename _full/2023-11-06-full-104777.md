Bricks are generally used as infilled walls or as room dividers in reinforced concrete structural frames In structural modeling brick walls are generally modeled as a load But in reality infilled walls contribute significantly to the framework of reinforced concrete structures For this reason it is necessary to include a wall model in the modeling In this analysis 3 models have been made namely Model M1 is a model without infilling walls open frame mode
