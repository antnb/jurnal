<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 5-25% of preschool children suffer from minor brain dysfunction, including fine motor development disorders<sup>1</sup>, globally it is reported that around 9% of children experience disorders in the form of anxiety, 11-15% are easily emotional, behavioral disorders. 9-15%. The Indonesian Ministry of Health<sup>2</sup> reported that 0.4 million (16%) Indonesian toddlers experienced developmental disorders, both fine and gross motor development, hearing impairment, reduced intelligence and speech delays. Meanwhile, according to the Health Service(3), 85,779 (62.02%) preschool age children experience developmental disorders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to the Ministry of Health<sup>4</sup>, the preschool period is called the golden period, window of opportunity and critical period. Meanwhile, according to Bloom. Children aged 0-4 years have increased their intelligence development by around 50%, and those aged 48 years have increased by 80%. Child development in the first years is very important and will determine the quality of the future. In the pre-school period there are various developmental tasks that children must master before they reach the next stage of development. Any obstacles in achieving these developmental tasks will hinder further development. Excessive pressure or expectations that are too high beyond a child's capacity can make children choose to lie or cheat in order to be accepted by their social group. <sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The factors that influence growth and development are external factors and internal factors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Internal factors consist of race/ethnicity or nation, family, age, gender, genetics, chromosomal abnormalities, glands, position of the child in the family, injuries and illnesses, while external factors can be seen from prenatal factors, namely nutrition, mechanical, toxic/chemical substances, infectious radiation, immunological disorders, maternal psychology. <sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Mazahiri in Mashara<sup>7</sup>, parents have a big influence on the future of children at various levels of their ages: from childhood to adolescence, to adulthood, whether in realizing their happy and glorious future or a future that is miserable and suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The results of research conducted by Wayanti<sup>8 </sup>which examined the factors of family income and education on the fine motor development of children aged 3-4 years. The research results show that based on statistical tests using Spearman Rank with a degree of significance of 0.05, it shows ρ value (0.303) &gt;&nbsp;α = 0.05 for income on development, so H0 is accepted. Meanwhile, education on development shows ρ value (0.019) &lt;&nbsp;α= 0.05, so H0 is rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Results of an initial survey conducted by the author on 10 parents at RA Al-Mini, Jambi City. 6 out of 4 parents stated that they always provide support to children by following the child's wishes for good growth and development, while 4 other parents stated that they still provide support to children, but not everything the child wants is followed because as parents to be more selective in choosing what will be given to children for the child's</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">growth and development and 7 out of 10 parents stated that strict education will shape the child's personal development for the better while 3 other parents stated that educating children with direction that suits the child's condition, Guiding children, being firm and disciplined is one way to optimize children's growth and development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore, this research aims to find out how family support and parenting patterns influence the growth and development of preschool-aged children at RA Al-Mini, Jambi City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HEADING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Growth</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Child growth is related to changes in the size, number, size or dimensions of cells, organs and individuals which can be measured by weight (grams, pounds, kilograms), length (cm, meters), bone age and metabolic balance. (body calcium and nitrogen retention). So it can be concluded that growth has an impact on physical aspects.<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Development</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Development is the increase in skill (ability) in more complex body structures and functions in a regular and predictable pattern, as a result of the maturation process. This involves the process of differentiation of body cells, body tissues, organs and organ systems which develop in such a way that each can fulfill its function. This also includes emotional, intellectual and behavioral development as a result of interaction with the environment.<sup>10</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Parenting</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Alimuddin<sup>11</sup>, parenting or caring for children is all parental activities related to physical and brain development. If the parenting style given by parents to a child is wrong, it will have an impact on the child's personality and development.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>MATERIAL AND METHODS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">This research is descriptive in nature with a cross sectional approach. The population of this study was all parents registered at RA Al-Mini, Jambi City, totaling 235 parents, and the sample for this study was 44 parents who were randomly selected according to the criteria using a purposive random sampling technique. Data analysis uses univariate and bivariate analysis, using the chi square test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To determine the required sample size, it can be calculated using the Slovin formula in Suyanto<sup>12</sup> as follows: n = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">N</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">N d<sup>2</sup>+1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Information</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">N = large population (235)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">n = sample size</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">d = desired level of precision 15% (0,15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">n = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">235</span><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=44,444 = 44 respondents</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">235 (0,15<sup>2</sup>)+1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So the number of samples needed in this research is 44 respondents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This research has received ethical approval from the Ethics Commission of the Faculty of Medicine, Andalas University.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">From the results of the research above, the presentation is higher in families who are good at their children's growth and development, families help parents to supervise children,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">families always listen to children's complaints, teach children to apologize when they make mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A family is a group of two or more parents who have the same blood relationship or not, who are involved in life continuously, who live under one roof, have emotional ties and have obligations between one person and another. Family roles are specific behaviors expected of a person in the family context.<sup>13</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This research is in line with research conducted by Delilla Arum Maulida<sup>14</sup> with the title The Relationship between Family Support and the Growth and Development of Preschool Age Children in Aisyiysh Bustanulathafal Kindergarten, which means there is a relationship between family support and the growth and development of preschool age children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to researchers, the family is one part of supporting children's growth and development, where children need a variety of stimulation to be able to develop their potential optimally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is recommended that families help parents to monitor children's growth and development and look after preschool children whose parents cannot supervise them all the time because parents are busy working outside the home.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">From the results of research conducted by Hidayati<sup>15</sup>, most of the parenting patterns applied by parents to children at RA Binaul Ummah Kuningan were democratic parenting, with 23 respondents (76.7%) out of 30 respondents. Differences in the application of parenting styles are influenced by several factors including: age, education, employment and length of interaction between respondents and children. Most of the respondents had normal child development as many as 23 people (76.7%) with democratic parenting as many as 18 people (60%), permissive 5 people (16.7%) and authoritarian parenting 7 people (23.3%) .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to the researchers' assumptions, one of the roles of parents is to develop social skills as a basis for living in society, so that guidance is needed to be able to behave positively in the future and efforts that parents can make regarding parenting patterns, namely shaping children's behavior in accordance with values and norms. which is good and in accordance with community life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Description of child growth and development at RA Al-Mini, Jambi City</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the table above, it can be seen that the majority of children have doubtful and deviant child growth and development categories, 20 (45.5%) and 4 (9%)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">respondents have appropriate child growth and development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Riyadi Sujono<sup>16</sup>, development is an increase in the structure and function of the body's organs which can be achieved through growth and development and learning, while growth is an increase in the physical size and structure of the body in part or in its entirety. Growth can be measured quantitatively, namely by measuring body weight, height, head circumference and upper arm circumference against age, to determine physical growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The definition of child growth is related to the problem of changes in the size, number, size or dimensions of cells, organs and individuals which can be measured by weight (grams, pounds, kilograms), length (cm, meters), bone age and metabolic balance. (body calcium and nitrogen retention). So it can be concluded that growth has an impact on physical aspects.<sup>10</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Growth and development has a regular and predictable pattern, which is the result of a process. There are several factors that influence development, namely: race/ethnicity, family, chromosomal abnormalities, gender and age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The researcher's assumption is that guidance is one of the things that helps to assist children in providing skills according to their development and needs so they can live their lives meaningfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Efforts that can be made to improve children's growth and development are by conducting outreach related to improving children's growth and development. The information provided should be in leaflet form so that parents and other family members can jointly improve children's growth and development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The relationship between family support and the growth and development of preschool children at RA Al-Mini, Jambi City</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the results of the research that has been carried out, it can be seen that of the 44 respondents it was found that 24 (54.5%) families had good family support and 20 (45.5%) had poor family support. 14 (70%) of their</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">children's growth and development experienced deviations, while 3 (12.5%) respondents who did not have good family support tended to have appropriate child growth and development. The research results show that there is a relationship between family support with a p-value of 0.012 &lt;&nbsp;0.05.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Family support is a family's attitude or action that provides support to a child that is positive for the child's behavior so that the family can provide information about school children's delinquency. Family support includes: instrumental support, informational support, research support, and emotional support. This concept influences the development of self-concept in elementary school-aged children. Self-concept, self-image is a person's attitude towards their body consciously or unconsciously. Self-ideal </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eum"><span class="font0">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eum</span></a><span class="font0"> doi:10.24843.MU.2024.V13.i02.P05</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">is an individual's perception of how he should behave in accordance with behavioral standards. Self-esteem is a selfassessment that every human being has regarding every behavior. Self-role is a set of behaviors expected by society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the results of research conducted by Rambe<sup>17</sup>, it can be seen that as many as 52.5% of respondents had toddlers aged 20-35 years, toddlers aged 2-3 years, 47.5% of toddlers whose growth was categorized as thin, and 50% of toddlers whose development was considered doubtful, 62.5% of family support makes sufficient efforts for the growth and development of toddlers. In conclusion, the role of the family is very significant in relation to the growth and development of toddlers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The researcher's assumption is that good family support does not necessarily mean good growth and development, where growth and development is not only done by monitoring but can be supported by providing nutritional intake and guidance to improve the child's growth and development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Efforts that families can make are to coordinate with parents when parents are busy or work outside the home, so they cannot supervise their children all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The relationship between parenting styles and the growth and development of preschool children at RA Al-Mini, Jambi City</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the results of the research that has been carried out, it can be seen that of the 44 respondents studied, the majority of respondents had good parenting patterns, 23 (52.3%) while 21 respondents (47.7%) had poor parenting patterns. Good parenting tends to have growth and development that experiences deviations as many as 14 (66.7%) while good parenting tends to have appropriate growth and development as many as 3 (13%). The results of the research show that there is no relationship between parenting styles and children's growth and development, the p-value is 0.026 &lt;&nbsp;0.05.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Parenting or parenting are all parental activities related to physical and brain development. If the parenting style given by parents to a child is wrong, it will have an impact on the child's personality and development.<sup>11</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In everyday life at home, as there are various educational or parenting patterns applied by parents linguistically, parenting consists of two words, namely &quot;pattern&quot; and &quot;parenting&quot;. Pattern is a form, regularity of something, while fostering means an educational attitude. Parenting is an activity carried out in an integrated manner over a long period of time by parents with their children, with the aim of guiding, developing and protecting the child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An integrated parenting style is a parenting style that is carried out jointly by both parents, there is no difference in attitude between father and mother. In other words, the parenting style applied by parents is a mutual agreement between father and mother. If there are differences in attitudes between father and mother in implementing educational patterns for children, then this will make the family condition unstable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From research conducted by Magdalena<sup>18</sup>, it shows that 30 respondents had good (democratic) parenting patterns, 28 children had normal child growth, 30 children had appropriate child development. The results of bivariate analysis showed a relationship between parenting styles and growth (p = 0.022) and development (p = 0.04).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Researchers assume that children who have deviations in growth and development can occur due to a lack of interaction and communication between parents and children, where the pre-school period is a golden period of growth that requires various simulations in developing children's potential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Efforts that can be made by parents in relation to parenting are maintaining the child's nutrition and nutritional intake, providing space and time in the child's development process, and carrying out the role of parents as friends or companions for the child.</span></p>
