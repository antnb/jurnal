The results of the study showed that there are four words found as lexical ambiguity and two factors of lexical ambiguity, namely polysemy and homonymy. The words ʻfloodʼ and ʻghostingʼ are classified as homonymy, and the words ʻpromiseʼ and ʻcurfewʼ are classified as polysemy.</span></p></td></tr>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Language is like an idea, emotion, and desire, which can produce symbols. According to Verderber (1999), language is the main body of words; it is the system they use in communication is shared by people from the same community or nation, in the same geographic area, the same culture or the same cultural tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Language is an oral or written communication system used by humans to interact with others. In the use of language in communication, sometimes one person (speaker) can easily explain the meaning of a word or sentence. However, another person (listener) does not necessarily understand the word the speaker wants to say. This phenomenon is explained in the semantic discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Semantics is the study of word and its relationship with its meaning. Griffiths (2006) states that semantics is a study of context-independent knowledge that language users have about the meaning of words and sentences. Meanwhile, according to Kreidler (1998), Semantics is an attempt to explain the speaker's knowledge of a language that allows the speaker to convey feelings, facts, products of imagination to others and understand what they are telling him or her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ambiguity is a language phenomenon that often occurs in daily communication. Leech (1981) stated that ambiguity is an expression when more than one interpretation can be apply to it and it can be considered ambiguous. This also emphasizes that ambiguity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">influenced by given context. It can be concluded that ambiguity gives room for alternative reactions to the same piece of language and happens when a word, phrase or sentence has more than one interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As an integral part of newspaper articles, news headlines are the focus of the news. The use of ambiguity in news headlines produces a humorous effect, arouses readers’ curiosity and attracts their attention. However, some words, sentences or phrases in the news have two or more different meanings, which are generally called lexical ambiguities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are some articles related to this study. Anggur (2019) analyzed lexical ambiguity, grammatical ambiguity also what factors that influence the skills of writing from experience story text of IV grade students of The Champion Denpasar-Bali. The results showed that there are two types of ambiguity, lexical ambiguity also grammatical ambiguity. Polysemy and homonymy are part of lexical ambiguity, while there are four parts of grammatical ambiguity which including grammatical ambiguity caused by grammatical word formation events, grammatical vocabulary because of context in the sentence or lack of grammatical context, grammatical ambiguity in similar phrases and ambiguity caused by the grammatical structure is inaccurate. The factors that influence the writing skills are the use of a foreign language in daily conversation, the internal problem like a family environment, the intelligence related to students ability to absorb the materials, also interests are related to emotional responses, encouragement and motives. The study is relevant to this study because it discusses lexical ambiguity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Charina (2017) analyzed the lexical ambiguity in which one word can be interpreted and have more than one interpretation and the structural ambiguity (syntactic) caused by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">structure of the sentence. The result showed there are 25 cases of ambiguity in total. The result was divided into 12 sentences lexically ambiguous, and 13 sentences were syntactically ambiguous. Meanwhile, Dharmayanti (2017) have had analyzed the lexical ambiguity in the slogans of Unilever products. The study showed that in the first section, 10 slogans contained lexical ambiguity categorized as conceptual meaning, and 3 slogans categorized as connotative meaning. In the second section, there are 7 brand slogans that are polysemy as lexical factors, and 6 brand slogans are homonymy. The study is relevant to this study because it discusses lexical ambiguity. These two studies are relevant to this study because they discuss lexical ambiguity, as well as lexical factors, namely polysemy and homonymy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another article related to this study is from Ermika, et al. (2021) has analyzed ambiguity, including the lexical and grammatical in English Textbook for tenth-grade students. From this analysis of 21 reading texts, there are 27 sentences with ambiguity. There are three kind of lexical ambiguity which are polysemy, homonym (20.68%), and antonym. The grammatical ambiguity consisted of coordinate structure (2.59%), active or passive meaning, negation scope, gerund + object or participle modifying a noun, prepositional phrase (PP) as modifier or sentence adjunct, and a head of inner modifier and outer modifier. The study is relevant to this study because it discusses lexical ambiguity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Faina, et al. (2021) analyzed the most dominant homonym of the lexical ambiguity used in the Coco movie script by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina. It just focused on the homonym used by Miguel as the main character in this movie. The result of the study showed there were 987 conversations of Coco movie script both in homophone and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">homograph. From 987 conversations of Coco movie script, it can be said that 226 conversations used the homophone words, consisted of 70 homophone words, and it occurred 645 times. Then, 70 conversations used the homograph words. It consisted of 29 homograph words, and it occurred in 06 times. So, it can be concluded that the most dominant homonym form of lexical ambiguity in Coco movie script was homophone which consisted of 70 words, and it occurred 645 times. In other articles, Kapadia &amp;&nbsp;Jufrizal (2013) analyzed the semantic ambiguity, including lexical and structural ambiguity in The Jakarta Post edition November and December 2012. The result of the study showed there are 113 ambiguities, including 60 lexical ambiguity (53.10%) and 53 structural ambiguity (46.90%). These two studies are relevant to this study because they also discuss about lexical ambiguity. The study by Kapadia Jufrizal take data from articles in The Jakarta Post, which are the same as the data sources in this study, but in different articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In an article related to this discussion, Pawestri &amp;&nbsp;Wongwattana (2018) analyzed the ambiguity found of Indonesian daily jokes in ‘dagelan’ which is an famous instagram account. The result of the study showed that jokes are formed with conversation and sentences consisting of independent also dependent clauses, even from the smaller phonetic form such as words and phrases. There are 10 types of ambiguity in this study, such as lexical ambiguity based jokes around 38% of the total, followed by phonological ambiguity based jokes at 19%, and lexicalization of larger unit based jokes at 11%, pragmatic ambiguity based jokes at 13%, textual cohesion based jokes at 8%, syntactic ambiguity based jokes at 5%, orthographic jokes at 2%, multiple ambiguity jokes at 2%, type of modality jokes and deictic reference jokes at 1%. The study is relevant to this</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">study because it also discusses about lexical ambiguity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Prasetyawan, et al. (2017) analyzed the ambiguity, including lexical ambiguity, referential ambiguity and syntactic ambiguity from 20 online recipes at </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bonappetit</span><span class="font3"> website editions from January until May 2017. The finding of the study showed that there are 34 total of ambiguity, including 9 lexical ambiguity (26.47%); 2 referential ambiguity (5.88%); and 23 syntactic ambiguity (67.64%). The syntactic ambiguity is the most dominant ambiguity in this study. In other articles, Purba, et al. (2020) analyzed the lexical and structural ambiguity in the opinion of The Jakarta Post from ten texts of opinion about Covid-19. The result of the analysis showed 26 lexical ambiguity and 16 structural ambiguities, including words, sentences, and phrases. These two studies are relevant to this study because they discuss about lexical ambiguity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Puspitasari (2019) analyzed the lexical and structural ambiguity taken from nineteen Jakarta Post daily newspaper editions from November 14 to November 25, 2017. The result showed 20 ambiguous words from 8 cases of lexical ambiguities caused by polysemy and 12 cases of structural ambiguities caused by equivocal phrasing. Meanwhile, Rahman &amp;&nbsp;Nurjannah (2017) have had analyzed the ambiguity in the local wisdom. The result of this analysis is that the word classes found as ambiguities words are Nouns 46.6 %, Adjectives 33.33 %, Verbs 6.66%, and Adverb 6.66%. The study by Puspitasari relevant to this study because she discusses about lexical ambiguity and used articles from The Jakarta Post. The study by Rahman and Nurjannah are relevant to this study because it discusses about ambiguities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The other article related to this discussion, Ramadhani (2015) analyzed to find the ambiguous words that have</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">many lexical meanings from the headline of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Jakarta Post</span><span class="font3"> newspaper. The study showed the result of analysis from 9 headlines. There are 10 ambiguous words categorized as polysemy. Romadlani (2021) analyzed the manipulation of semantic meanings especially dealing with lexical semantics in humor creation strategy from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mind Your Language</span><span class="font3"> situation comedy. The result showed that the lexical-semantic is divided into five kinds: homonymy, homophone, hyponymy, and synonymy. These two studies are relevant to this study because they discuss about lexical ambiguity. The study by Ramadhani takes data from articles in The Jakarta Post, which are the same as the data sources in this study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the other hand, Sastraparamitha &amp;&nbsp;Martarini (2020) analyzed the ambiguity in five advertisements. The results of the analysis indicate that from four advertisements, one is caused by homonymy (plate 4: Advertisement of Facebook); two of the others are caused by puns and homonymy (plate 1&amp; 2: Advertisements of Big Cola and McDonald); and the last is caused by metaphor (plate 3: Advertisement of Toyota PRIUS). The last article is from Yastanti &amp;&nbsp;Setiawati (2018), they have had analyzed the ambiguity in the soundtrack lyrics of the Moana movie. The result showed that in “We Know the Way” lyric, there are 26 ambiguity consist of 8 structural ambiguity and 18 lexical ambiguity; and there are 45 ambiguity, consist of 10 structural ambiguity and 35 lexical ambiguity in “I’m Moana” lyric. These two studies are relevant to this study because they also discuss about lexical ambiguity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the background given above, the problems that are discussed in this study are: (1) What is the lexical ambiguity found in the News Headlines of The Jakarta Post? (2) What lexical factors can lead to lexical ambiguity?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>METHOD AND THEORY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The data in this study was taken from Jakarta Post that was published throughout 2019-2021, which includes all the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences. The collected data was underlined and analyzed based on the theory of lexical ambiguity by Ullmann (1967). </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lexical ambiguity</span><span class="font3"> is the presence of two or more possible meanings for a single word. It is the possibility of multiple interpretations of spoken or written language, without some additional information.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>RESULT AND DISCUSSIONS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The analysis is focused on identifying the lexical ambiguity and analyzed the factors of lexical ambiguity. The theory was proposed by Ullmann (1967). There are two causal factors of lexical ambiguity, those are polysemy and homonymy. Polysemy is a fundamental feature of human speech, which can arise in a multiplicity of ways. The same word may have two or more different meaning. Homonymy is far less common and far less complex than polysemy, though its effects can be just as serious and even more dramatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">01/HO/SEP/25/19</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Students throng in front of House, more </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">flood</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> into Jakarta as protests continue”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The headlines above considered as lexical ambiguity by the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">flood</span><span class="font3">. This word is classified as a homonymy. This word has lexical ambiguous meaning because it caused the reader to interpret its literal meaning which does not fit the meaning of the word in context. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">flood</span><span class="font3"> has several meanings by Oxford dictionary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Flood (noun):</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A large amount of water covering an area that is usually dry</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A very large number of things or people that appear at the same time</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the definitions of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">flood</span><span class="font3"> above the headlines might be interpreted into:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First interpretation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Students throng in front of House, more </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">amount of water covering</span><span class="font3"> into Jakarta as protests continue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Second interpretation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Students throng in front of House, more </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">people appear at the same time</span><span class="font3"> into Jakarta as protests continue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Between two interpretations above, the second interpretation fitted better with the news as it also showed on first paragraph below to have better understanding:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thousands of university students from across Indonesia</span><span class="font3"> have once again taken to the streets in a continuation of a series of protests against...” From the bold sentences, the writer intended to deliver that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">flood</span><span class="font3"> is a large amount of people which in this news are university students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The causal factors of this lexical ambiguity word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">flood</span><span class="font3"> is homonyms because the pronounciation and spelling are identical but the meanings of this word completely different or unrelated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">02/HO/MAR/24/21</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Ghosting</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">: Is the phenomenon of shutting people out acceptable?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The headlines above is considered as lexical ambiguity by the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ghosting</span><span class="font3">. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ghosting</span><span class="font3"> comes from the basic word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ghost</span><span class="font3"> added to suffix </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">-ing</span><span class="font3">. This word is classified as a homonymy. This word has lexical ambiguous meaning because it caused the reader to interpret its literal meaning which does not fit the meaning of the word in context. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ghosting</span><span class="font3"> has several meanings by Oxford dictionary. As in oxford dictionary the word ‘ghosting’ has several meanings as below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ghosting (noun)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The appearance of a pale second image next to an image on a television screen, computer screen, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The practice of ending a personal relationship with somebody by suddenly stopping all communication without explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the definitions of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ghosting</span><span class="font3"> above the headlines might be interpreted into:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First Interpretation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">The appearance of a pale second image</span><span class="font3">: Is the phenomenon of shutting people out acceptable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Second Interpretation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Ending a personal relationship with somebody by suddenly stopping all communication without explanation</span><span class="font3">: Is the phenomenon of shutting people out acceptable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Between two interpretations above, the second interpretation fitted better with the news as it also showed on first paragraph below to have better understanding:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The term refers to the act of “disappearing” from someoneʼs life, ceasing all contact with that person without any explanation and typically ignoring any contact attempts..”</span><span class="font3"> This paragraph could explain enough the meaning of word ‘ghosting’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The causal factors of this lexical ambiguity word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ghosting</span><span class="font3"> is homonyms because the pronounciation and spelling are identical but the meanings of this word completely different or unrelated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">03/PO/DEC/30/20</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Regeneron says its COVID-19 antibody therapy showed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">promise</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> in patients.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The headlines above is considered as lexical ambiguity by the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">promise</span><span class="font3">. This word is classified as a polysemy. This word has lexical ambiguous meaning because it caused the reader to interpret its literal meaning which does not fit the meaning of the word in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">context. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">promise</span><span class="font3"> has several meanings by Oxford dictionary below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Promise (noun)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A sign, or a reason for hope that something may happen, especially something good</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Promise (verb)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To tell somebody that you will definitely do or not do something, or that something will definitely happen</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the definitions of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">promise</span><span class="font3"> above the headlines might be interpreted into:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First Interpretation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Regeneron says its COVID-19 antibody therapy showed </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">something will definitely happen</span><span class="font3"> in patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Second Interpretation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Regeneron says its COVID-19 antibody therapy showed </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">a sign of something</span><span class="font3"> in patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Between two interpretations above, the first interpretation fitted better with the news as it also showed on first and fifth paragraph below to have better understanding:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">...its experimental antibody cocktail for use in some hospitalized COVID-19 patients show the therapy was sufficiently effective to warrant continuing the trial</span><span class="font3">”. In the last sentence of this paragraph tells that ‘therapy was suffieciently effective’, then the terapy produces a good result. As mentioned in the fifth paragraph, “</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Seronegative patients treated with the antibody cocktail </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">had a lower risk of death or needing mechanical </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ventilation</span><span class="font3">...”. This proves that the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">promise</span><span class="font3"> means ‘something will definitely happen’, not only ‘a sign of someting’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The causal factors of this lexical ambiguity word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">promise</span><span class="font3"> is polysemy because the pronounciation and spelling are the same. This word has different meaning but related senses. According to the one of the sources of the causal factors polysemy, namely shifts in application: the noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">promise</span><span class="font3"> change</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">into the verb meaning, with the same pronounciation and spelling..</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">04/PO/JAN/03/21</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Lockdowns, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">curfews,</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> alcohol bans as nations fight resurgent virus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The headlines above is considered as lexical ambiguity by the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">curfew</span><span class="font3">. This word is classified as a polysemy. This word has lexical ambiguous meaning because it caused the reader to interpret its literal meaning which does not fit the meaning of the word in context. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">curfew</span><span class="font3"> has several meanings by Oxford dictionary below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Curfew (noun)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A law that says that people must not go outside after a particular time at night until the morning; the time after which nobody must go outside</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A time when children must be home in the evening</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the definitions of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">curfew</span><span class="font3"> above the headlines might be interpreted into:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First Interpretation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lockdowns, </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">the law of people must stay at home in particular time</span><span class="font3">, alcohol bans as nations fight resurgent virus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Second Interpretation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lockdowns, </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">a time when children must be home in the evening</span><span class="font3">, alcohol bans as nations fight resurgent virus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Between two interpretations above, the first interpretation fitted better with the news as it also showed on nineteenth and twentieth paragraph below to have better understanding:</span></p>
