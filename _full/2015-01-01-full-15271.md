The aim of this study was to analyze several primary combinations for amplifying inhA promoter region by in silico and in vitro ways Primary in silicos analysis was done by Clone Manager Suite 6 program fabG gene sequence of M tuberculosis was downloaded from wwwncbinlmnihgov genbank U668011 and used as DNA template In vitro detection was done by PCR technique using P16 and 86 M tuberculosis MDR isolates as DNA template Amplification was done in desc
