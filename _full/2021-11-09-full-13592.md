Thirtymer oligonucleotides for microarray analysis were designed from the annotated open reading framesORFs in the whole genome sequence of X oryzae pv oryzae KACC10331 Mutant hrpXoTN and wildtypestrain KACC10859 were cultured in hrp inducing medium XOM2 and cDNAs which were synthesizedfrom the total RNA samples from both strains were hybridized on a DNA microarray The microarraydata showed that 210 genes were downregulated more than 2fold in hrpXo
