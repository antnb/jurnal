<p><span class="font4">A plethora of studies reveal that stakeholder engagement is critical in sustainability reporting. However, there is a paucity in the literature on how stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting may lead to more meaningful sustainability reports. This paper aims to conceptualise the role of stakeholder engagement in producing more meaningful sustainability reports. This conceptual paper offers avenues for future empirical research. This paper contributes to the literature and the theory by shedding light on the importance of institutional work in shifting the institutional logic of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting from a strategic management tool to an accountability mechanism so that more meaningful sustainability reports are produced. Stakeholder engagement allows the reporting companies to become more aware of sustainability issues that are informed by their stakeholders while the engaged stakeholders also benefit from the information provided by the reporting companies on the issues, agenda, and performance related to sustainability.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The objective of this paper is to conceptualise the important roles of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting in order to promote more meaningful sustainability reports for both the preparers and the readers. Prior studies reveal that stakeholder engagement is a crucial element of sustainability reporting (see, for example,</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Bellucci et al., 2019;</span></a><span class="font4"> Kaur &amp;&nbsp;Lodhia, 2018). However, there is a paucity in the literature on how stakeholder engagement can contribute to the production of more meaningful sustainability reports. The meaningfulness of sustainability reports has become a critical issue because the reporting arguably tends to contain self-serving bias or self-laudatory in nature </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Keusch et al.,</span></a><span class="font4"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">2012)</span></a><span class="font4">. To some extent, the report is arguably manipulative </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Hahn &amp;&nbsp;Lülfs,</span></a><span class="font4"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">2014)</span></a><span class="font4">, camouflaging</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> (Michelon et al., 2016)</span></a><span class="font4">, and even a simulacrum </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Boiral, 2013)</span></a><span class="font4">. Therefore, reporting companies are expected to identify and engage with their stakeholders to produce more meaningful sustainability reports in the sense that the sustainability information provided in the report may meet the expectations of stakeholders from such engagement otherwise it will only be about luck </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Rinaldi et al.,</span></a><span class="font4"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">2014)</span></a><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The essence of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting is communication or dialogue between a reporting company and its relevant stakeholders </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(AA1000, 2015; GRI, 2016; Kaur &amp;&nbsp;Lodhia, 2018).</span></a><span class="font4"> Engaging with stakeholders allows the reporting company to improve its business process, while the engaged stakeholders are also informed regarding the company’s sustainability issues, agenda, and performance </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(AA1000, 2015; Ferrero-Ferrero et al., 2018; GRI, 2016).</span></a><span class="font4"> This paper responds to a call for conceptualising the complexity of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting which lays in a continuum of two ends, i.e., as a strategic management tool and an accountability mechanism</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> (Rodríguez-Gutiérrez, 2021; Rinaldi et al. 2014).</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">This paper conceptualises that stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting is an ongoing process of planning, implementing, and controlling a dialogic engagement between a reporting company and its stakeholders. More specifically, for an engagement with stakeholder to be able to contribute to a more meaningful sustainability report (i.e., one which adds value for both the reporting company and its stakeholders), the reporting should be based on a continuous clear-scope dialogic and agreed decision-making process with stakeholders on recent material sustainability issues </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(AA1000, 2015)</span></a><span class="font4">. The reporting company along with its stakeholders should have strong commitment to integrate sustainability issues into the company’s strategy, governance, and operation and disseminate the agreed sustainability topics into its sustainability report transparently </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Bellucci et al., 2019)</span></a><span class="font4">. This conceptual paper follows </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">Smith et al. (2011) </span></a><span class="font4">in that It goes beyond merely reviewing the extant literature. It offers a conceptual framework for future empirical studies in the field of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting by reviewing the extant literature and making reference to sustainability reporting frameworks and neo-institutional theory. A plethora of studies using the theory assumes that institutions are taken for granted leading to stable and isomorphic (similar) practices (see, for example,</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> (Fitriasari &amp;</span></a><span class="font4">&nbsp;Kawahara 2018; Yusoff et al., 2019). This conceptual paper conceptualises an institutional work in the field that strives to disrupt an old institution (the conception where companies engage with stakeholders by informing them about the companies’ sustainability issues) and replace it with the new one (the conception where stakeholders are engaged in dialogue to solve sustainability issues and define sustainability report content). From this, stakeholder engagement can produce more meaningful sustainability reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This paper offers both practical and theoretical contributions. Firstly, it offers a conceptual framework that can be used as guidance for empirical research in the field of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting using the neo-institutional theory. Secondly, it sheds light on how stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting should be institutionalised for a more meaningful report towards a taken-for-granted accountability mechanism to stakeholders. Lastly, it offers practical contribution for reporting companies through an increasing awareness about the importance of stakeholder engagement not only for their business process but also for producing more meaningful information in sustainability reports. Equally important, it also increases the awareness of stakeholders about companies’ sustainability issues, agenda, and performance by taking a part in variety of engagement mechanisms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This paper is structured as follows. The next two sections review the underpinning theory and define what stakeholder engagement really is respectively. The following section conceptualises a model of stakeholder engagement in sustainability</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">reporting towards more meaningful sustainability reports. The last section concludes this paper and outlines avenues for future empirical research utilising the proposed model.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Neo-Institutional Theory as the Underpinning Theory. Neo-institutional theory views stakeholder engagement as a relational space </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Wooten &amp;&nbsp;Hoffman, 2013)</span></a><span class="font4"> where actors in a reporting company interact with other actors (i.e., stakeholders). They interact with one to another for collective understandings </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Scott, 2014)</span></a><span class="font4"> about the company’s sustainability issues and decide what material topics should be included in the sustainability report. The presence of new economic, social, and/or environmental issues, for example, would be a disruptive event for the existing collective rationality among the field members (actors in the company and stakeholders) </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Thornton &amp;&nbsp;Ocasio,</span></a><span class="font4"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">2008)</span></a><span class="font4">. Stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting constitutes relational space in which idea contestation with conflicting arguments and views are resolved and a new collective rationality is developed by field members </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Thornton et al., 2012)</span></a><span class="font4">. Actors would try to persuade, build mutual awareness, and gain admittance by challenging the existing collective rationality among field members. Once they receive support from the field members, the existing collective rationality would be altered, and new collective understandings would arise in the field. During the process of idea contestation, field members may respond to it differently from adoption to adaptation </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Oliver, 1991)</span></a><span class="font4">. Heterogeneity, variation, and change in the field of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting indicate dynamic process of institutionalisation of the field over time </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Scott, 2014)</span></a><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The perceived meaning of an organisational field refers to institutional logic through the neo-institutional theory lens.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Thornton &amp;&nbsp;Ocasio (2008) </span></a><span class="font4">define institutional logic as “the socially constructed, historical patterns of cultural symbols and material practices, including assumptions, values, and beliefs, by which individuals and organizations provide meaning to their daily activity, organize time and space, and reproduce their lives and experiences”. Further,</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Thornton et al. (2012) </span></a><span class="font4">convincingly argue that institutional logics account for the dynamic both material (structure and practice) and symbolic (ideation and meaning) elements of every institutional order in society. Research in institutional logics shows dialectic tension between competing logics underlying an institutional order </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Ocasio et al., 2017)</span></a><span class="font4">. For example,</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Marquis &amp;</span></a><span class="font4">&nbsp;Lounsbury (2007) examined about community logic versus market logic in banking sector while</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Dunn &amp;&nbsp;Jones (2010) </span></a><span class="font4">studied about professional logic versus science logic in medical education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The current structure and practice in the field are influenced by a dominant logic among the other competing logics </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Thornton et al., 2012)</span></a><span class="font4">. The current dominant logic may be shifted or replaced by the other competing logics such as institutional environment and the interpretation of meanings among actors may change over time </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Marquis &amp;&nbsp;Lounsbury, 2007)</span></a><span class="font4">. For example, ,</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Thornton &amp;&nbsp;Ocasio (1999) </span></a><span class="font4">find a shift from editorial logics to market logics in the field of higher education publishing. Dynamic change in institutional logics would make institutions never able to get fully institutionalised. Institutionalisation is not an end point but an on-going process because actors, interests, and interpretation of meanings may change across time hence understanding meanings in local context are critical not only to the initiation of institutional change but also to its continuous maintenance </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(T. B. Lawrence &amp;&nbsp;Suddaby,</span></a><span class="font4"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">2006)</span></a><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Institutional logics help explain how institutional entrepreneurs interpret social or cultural meanings and challenge the meanings with other actors in a relational space </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Thornton &amp;&nbsp;Ocasio, 2008; Wooten &amp;&nbsp;Hoffman, 2013). Hardy &amp;&nbsp;Maguire (2013) </span></a><span class="font4">state that institutional entrepreneurs play an important role in framing an idea and engaging in competing logics. Therefore, institutional entrepreneurs should have the ability to discover idea, communicate the idea, and convince others to manipulate institutions through shifting institutional logics from existing logic to the new one </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Thornton et al.,</span></a><span class="font4"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">2012)</span></a><span class="font4">. Entrepreneurial actors should have the power to mobilise resources and the ability to engage in contestation in meanings and practices </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(T. B. Lawrence, 2008)</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">Institutional entrepreneurship is a juxtaposing notion leading to a paradox of embedded agency </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Garud et al., 2007)</span></a><span class="font4">. On the one hand, institutions have been believed as taken-for-granted social facts with socially and culturally embedded understandings that provide specification and justification for social arrangements and behaviours towards stability and continuity </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Hardy &amp;&nbsp;Maguire, 2013)</span></a><span class="font4">. On the other hand, entrepreneurship expect changes in the existing rules, norms, and beliefs, instead of continuity </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Garud et al., 2007)</span></a><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The paradox of embedded agency in institutional entrepreneurship gives rise to two concerns </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Hardy &amp;&nbsp;Maguire, 2013)</span></a><span class="font4">. Firstly, it is unclear that actors who are embedded in the existing institutional arrangements, and have been given advantages by it, are able to generate novel ideas for institutional change. Dominant actors who hold dominant resources which are needed for transformation of institutions usually have been deeply embedded in—and given advantages by—the existing institutions and therefore they might not be able to come up with novel ideas of institutional transformation. Secondly, it is also unclear that the desired actors for institutional change are able to persuade other actors in the organisational field to institutionalise new practices. The desired actors for change are usually peripheral actors, i.e., those who are not deeply embedded in and benefiting from the existing institutions and have relatively little power and resources to promote change by realising their novel ideas. Entrepreneurial actors who initiate institutional change can be individual actors </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Dew,</span></a><span class="font4"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">2006)</span></a><span class="font4">, or collective actors, such as organisations </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Déjean et al., 2004)</span></a><span class="font4">, professions (Greenwood et al., 2002), and associations </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Demil &amp;&nbsp;Bensédrine, 2005)</span></a><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Institutional entrepreneurship may arise in any possible state of organisational field </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Hardy &amp;&nbsp;Maguire, 2013)</span></a><span class="font4">. However, a plethora of studies</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> (Child et al., 2007;</span></a><span class="font4"> Greenwood &amp;&nbsp;Suddaby 2006; Maguire et al., 2004) find that emerging fields and those in crisis are likely to have greater opportunity for institutional entrepreneurship for two reasons. First, emerging organisational fields are indicated by lack of institutionalised practices that becomes a stimulus for entrepreneurial actors to solve problems. Second, organisational fields which are experiencing crisis often show disruptive events with ambiguities and pressures up to the surface hence uncertainty, tensions, and contradictions in the crisis fields may become another stimulus for institutional entrepreneurs to initiate institutional change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Instead of focusing on who the institutional entrepreneurs or actors shaping the institution are, institutional work focuses on the actors’ actions because the central of institutional dynamic is the actions undertaken by institutional entrepreneurs</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> (Lawrence</span></a><span class="font4"> et al. 2013; Lawrence et al., 2009).</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> T. B. Lawrence &amp;&nbsp;Suddaby (2006) </span></a><span class="font4">define institutional work as “the purposive action of individuals and organizations aimed at creating, maintaining, and disrupting institutions”. There are at least two overlooked issues in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">institutional work as identified by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Lawrence et al. (2013).</span></a><span class="font4"> First, institutional work is not only about successful purposive actions in shaping institutions that may include unplanned consequences. Secondly, cognitive and emotional aspects of actors engaged in institutional work are equally as important as their skills and expertise, hence reflexive dimension (i.e., actors’ beliefs and attitudes) in institutional work is very fruitful to study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Stakeholder Engagement Defined. Stakeholder engagement is an interactive relationship between an organisation and its stakeholders in which stakeholders are viewed as “a source of value and competitive advantage” for the organisation </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(A. T.</span></a><span class="font4"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">Lawrence &amp;&nbsp;Weber, 2014)</span></a><span class="font4">. The importance of stakeholder engagement is in line with the principle of “stakeholder inclusiveness” </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(GRI, 2016)</span></a><span class="font4"> or “stakeholder inclusivity” </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(AA1000, 2015)</span></a><span class="font4"> in that the reporting companies should be able to identify who their stakeholders are and how the expectations and interests of those stakeholders are met.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The basis for determining stakeholders may vary amongst reporting companies. </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">Mitchell et al. (1997),</span></a><span class="font4"> for example, develop a model of stakeholder salience in order to determine which stakeholders the company should focus on based on three attributes, namely stakeholder’s power, legitimacy, and urgency. The more attributes the stakeholders have, the more salient those stakeholders are. Meanwhile, stakeholder engagement approaches could take on various forms </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Gao &amp;&nbsp;Zhang, 2006)</span></a><span class="font4">, such as passive engagement, listening engagement, limited two-way process engagement, and active engagement. Indeed, stakeholder engagement is a crucial point in sustainability reporting </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Manetti &amp;&nbsp;Bellucci, 2016)</span></a><span class="font4"> because it may facilitate the quality of reporting </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(KPGM, 2015)</span></a><span class="font4"> and completeness of the report </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Adams, 2004)</span></a><span class="font4">. For being accountable to stakeholders, the purpose of stakeholder engagement should be upgraded from only developing knowledge and understanding to addressing sustainability concerns as expected by stakeholders </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Bebbington et al., 2007)</span></a><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In every effort to address sustainability issues, companies should be open to criticism from stakeholders </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Hörisch et al., 2015)</span></a><span class="font4">. Ideally, there should be a platform to facilitate wider debate—not only about criticism from stakeholders which demands for quick response by company—but also debate among different stakeholder groups </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Unerman &amp;&nbsp;Bennett, 2004)</span></a><span class="font4">. However, not all companies are ready for such a situation. Several companies choose to provide internet-based platforms for stakeholder engagement with internally-generated contents </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Rinaldi, 2013)</span></a><span class="font4">. Reputational risk management over unsustainable practices becomes an important consideration of managers in designing stakeholder engagement, as noticed by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Dillard &amp;&nbsp;Yuthas (2013)</span></a><span class="font4"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">and Ardiana (2019).</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among scholarly works on stakeholder engagement, there are at least two broad perspectives on stakeholder engagement, namely strategic and holistic views </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Rinaldi, 2013)</span></a><span class="font4">. The strategic perspective focuses on engagement with relevant stakeholders, e.g., those with have power, legitimacy, and urgency </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Mitchell et al., 1997)</span></a><span class="font4"> to a company’s economic, social, and environmental issues. Companies according to this view consider stakeholder engagement as a strategic management tool for improving their competitive position (marketing tool), warding off stakeholder challenges (social tool), and/or reducing political pressure and regulation (political tool). In contrast, the holistic perspective views stakeholder engagement as an accountability mechanism for companies with regard to sustainability issues to all stakeholders, of which the engagement should be based “long-term, open, and mutually respectful relationship”</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Rinaldi, 2013)</span></a><span class="font4">. In other words, companies should not be benefiting one stakeholder group (e.g., financially-powerful stakeholder groups) while harming another group (e.g., local communities) but be open to stakeholder criticism for improvement of internal business process because building their reputation requires support from multiple stakeholder groups inclusively.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Rinaldi, 2013)</span></a><span class="font4"> and</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Rinaldi et al. (2014) </span></a><span class="font4">suggest that strategic and holistic views of stakeholder engagement are two opposite camps, of which the holistic view is the very ideal condition of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting. In practice, they found that stakeholder engagement practices lay along a continuum between these two opposite ends. Extra efforts should be undertaken over time by companies to shift the practice of stakeholder engagement towards the ideal level of accountability to all stakeholders.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Adapting literature review papers by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Curtis &amp;&nbsp;Mont (2020) </span></a><span class="font4">and</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Geissdoerfer et al. (2018)</span></a><span class="font4"> in wider sustainability topics, this paper reviews the literature on stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting. Key publications being reviewed were those listed on the Academic Journal Guide 2021 level 3 and above, published between 2011 and 2020 with keywords “stakeholder engagement” and “sustainability reporting”. They are reputable peer-reviewed journals ranked by the Chartered Association of Business School </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Guide, 2021)</span></a><span class="font4">. Appendix 1 shows the list of the key publications. Following</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Paul &amp;</span></a><span class="font4">&nbsp;Criado (2020), the ten-year period between 2011 and 2020 was determined to be able to undertake a systematic literature review leading to the conceptualisation of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since this paper is a conceptual paper, it goes beyond merely reviewing the extant literature (the key publications shown in Appendix 1). In conceptualising stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting, this paper also makes reference to sustainability reporting frameworks. The neo-institutional theory was chosen to illuminate the idea that an institution is not necessarily taken for granted and stable – it can be questioned and replaced by a new institution. Institutional entrepreneurs come with a new institution to challenge the status quo. Their institutional work strives to disrupt the existing institution and replace it with the new one. The dynamic nature of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting and how it can bring significant changes to both the reporting organisations and stakeholders can be illuminated by the neo-institutional theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Conceptualising Stakeholder Engagement in Sustainability Reporting Towards More Meaningful Sustainability Reports.

<p><span class="font4">Having considered the potential risks of stakeholder engagement, reporting companies should decide on an approach to engagement for each identified stakeholder</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">group </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Rinaldi et al., 2014)</span></a><span class="font4">.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Gao &amp;&nbsp;Zhang (2006) </span></a><span class="font4">posit that stakeholder engagement can be in the form of passive engagement (i.e., literally, the reporting companies do nothing), announcing engagement (i.e., this may include one-way communication from company to stakeholders via reports, websites, bulletins, letters, public presentations, among others, with a purpose to advocate company’s concerns to stakeholders or to inform them), listening engagement (i.e., the companies aim to monitor perception of stakeholders by asking them to provide comments and suggestions about companies’ sustainability issues), limited two-way communication engagement (i.e., the company communicates with stakeholders to consult or negotiate regarding a company’s sustainability issues, e.g., through focus group discussions, public meetings and workshops, bargaining with employees in unions, etc.), and active engagement (i.e., stakeholders are actively involved and empowered in an extensive two-way communication with the company, e.g., through partnerships, multi-stakeholder initiatives, and integration of stakeholders in the company’s governance, strategy, and operations).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Stakeholder engagement requires the support of multiple resources, such as financial, technological, and human resources. In many cases, the capacity of the resources needs to be developed and increased as a preparation for engagement with stakeholders </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(AA1000, 2015)</span></a><span class="font4">. For example, communication and negotiation skills may need to be improved before the engagement with employees, media, and other stakeholder groups. Companies may need technological devices to communicate with relevant stakeholders in different geographical areas and they may need to prepare a budget for the engagement. As a part of the planning stage, companies also need to prepare all documents to record the process of stakeholder engagement, such as minutes of meetings, memorandums of understanding, and questionnaires. These documents are very important as a basis for accountability on stakeholder engagement </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Rinaldi et al., 2014)</span></a><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After being planned, it is the time for the implementation of the stakeholder engagement. The identified stakeholder groups should be invited to participate in an engagement as planned </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Bellucci et al., 2019)</span></a><span class="font4">. The company should document the whole process as evidence and the basis of accountability. Stakeholder engagement does not end when companies received comments, suggestions, or critics from stakeholders </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Unerman, 2007)</span></a><span class="font4">. It should develop an action plan and communicate the progress with stakeholders </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(AA1000, 2015)</span></a><span class="font4">. Later, the output of stakeholder engagement, together with the agreed action plan, will be continuously reviewed in the controlling stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As mentioned earlier, planned actions which were developed in the implementation stage should be followed up by responding to inputs (critics, comments, suggestions) from stakeholders for organisational improvement </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Bellucci et al., 2019)</span></a><span class="font4">. The company should continuously monitor and evaluate current engagement for better planning and implementation in future engagements </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Kaur &amp;&nbsp;Lodhia, 2018)</span></a><span class="font4">. Last but not the least, the controlling stage is disclosing stakeholder engagement through one or more mediums for reporting, such as through stand-alone sustainability report, corporate website, and many other possible mediums, as an accountability mechanism </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Rinaldi et al., 2014)</span></a><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Quality of Stakeholder Engagement</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font4"> Stakeholder engagement is considered high quality if there is a binding commitment between the reporting company and its stakeholders. The high quality of the engagement is also shown by an integration of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">stakeholders in the company’s governance, strategy, and operations </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Adams &amp;&nbsp;Frost,</span></a><span class="font4"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">2008)</span></a><span class="font4">. The scope of engagement should be set clearly in the planning stage and implemented consistently with a focus on sustainability topics that are relevant to both</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the company and stakeholders in order to avoid the out-of-context discussions during the engagement </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(AA1000, 2015)</span></a><span class="font4">. As the essence of this engagement is an ongoing process of communication with stakeholders, for it to be good quality, it should involve the agreed decision-making process and opportunities of two-way dialogue between the company and stakeholders</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> (Bellucci et al., 2019)</span></a><span class="font4">. Stakeholder engagement should be conducted in a timely fashion for the relevance of information and should be communicated transparently so its outcome adds value to both the reporting company and stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The completeness of overall disclosures in sustainability reports has been questioned by those interested in using them. Most of the reporting companies tend to disclose only positive and neutral issues and try to hide negative issues</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> (Bellucci et al.,</span></a><span class="font4"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">2018)</span></a><span class="font4">. Disclosures in sustainability reports are complete if there is a balance of information between positive and negative issues about the company’s sustainability performance </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Rinaldi et al., 2014)</span></a><span class="font4">. In other words, complete disclosures require no omission of relevant information reflecting sustainability aspects that facilitate or influence stakeholders’ decisions. In addition, the scope of reporting (i.e., the range of economic, social, and environmental aspects) should reflect significantly all corresponding economic, social, and environmental impacts of company’s activities, strategy, and performance on stakeholders while at the same time the stakeholders are able to assess the company’s sustainability performance </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(AA1000, 2015)</span></a><span class="font4">. Complete disclosures also require clear boundaries between those material economic, social, and</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">environmental aspects, i.e., how sustainability aspects impact within and outside the company. Not only material sustainability aspects need to be disclosed in current reporting period, material future impacts also need to be disclosed in current reporting period if they are reasonably predictable and may become unescapable or unalterable </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Bellucci et al., 2019)</span></a><span class="font4">. Therefore, a higher degree of the completeness of overall disclosures in sustainability reports is indicated by more balanced information between positive and negative issues, a wider scope, and boundaries between aspects, and the inclusion current and future impacts in current reporting period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Institutional Work Towards More Meaningful Sustainability Reports. All companies certainly engage with their stakeholders in their day-to-day operations. They interact with, among others, their customers, suppliers, employees, creditors, shareholders in running their business as usual. However, companies need to communicate about their sustainability issues, initiatives, performance, and agenda with their stakeholders for the purpose of disclosing this information in their sustainability reports </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(AA1000, 2015; GRI, 2016; Rinaldi et al., 2014).</span></a><span class="font4"> Companies may decide to engage with their stakeholders in sustainability reporting through various means such as, among others, brochures, questionnaires, email correspondence, focus group discussions, project partnership </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Gao &amp;&nbsp;Zhang, 2006)</span></a><span class="font4">. Unfortunately, not all of these stakeholder engagement approaches may reflect and facilitate the conditions needed for more</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">meaningful sustainability reports as well as a means of accountability to wider stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4">To achieve a high level of accountability to a broader range of stakeholders and more meaningful sustainability reports, management of the reporting companies should be aware of and committed to the importance of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting. Commitment and awareness will only develop when managers consider the whole process of sustainability reporting as an investment instead of a cost for company </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Bellucci et al., 2018)</span></a><span class="font4">. Without such commitment, disclosures in sustainability reports are merely information in documents or on websites as a communication to stakeholders that is empty of genuine meaning hence the reporting company will not benefit optimally from the reporting and nor will the stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Stakeholder engagement practices which lead to more meaningful sustainability reports are those which add value or deliver advantages to both the reporting companies and stakeholders. Those practices which meet the main traits of high-quality stakeholder engagement practices may result in more meaningful sustainability reports. </span><a href="#bookmark14"><span class="font4">Table 3 </span></a><span class="font4">presents the meaningfulness of sustainability reports to both the reporting companies and stakeholders which arises from a high quality of stakeholder engagement practices.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font4">High quality stakeholder engagement practices should not be about the company disseminating sustainability information to stakeholders, but they are about everyone participating in the co-creation of knowledge and problem solving</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> (Rinaldi et</span></a><span class="font4"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">al., 2014)</span></a><span class="font4">. This is what transformational learning from stakeholder engagement is all about and supposed to be. It is not about a transaction that happens during stakeholder engagement (e.g., stakeholders ask for information and clarification about a company’s sustainability issues while the company responds to those stakeholders’ enquiries), but it is about changing a way both parties look at the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Diverse stakeholder engagement practices in sustainability reporting are present on a continuum of two ends created by theoretical perspectives </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Rinaldi et al., 2014)</span></a><span class="font4">. In</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">other words, there are two kinds of institutional logic in stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting through the neo-institutional theory lens, namely strategic management logic and also accountability logic.</span><a href="#bookmark15"><span class="font4"> Table 4 </span></a><span class="font4">distinguishes these two logics or perspectives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Managers in reporting companies should act as institutional entrepreneurs who are able to challenge the existing practice of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting, envision, and make convincing the new and better practice towards more meaningful reports for the company and stakeholders </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">(Hardy &amp;&nbsp;Maguire, 2013)</span></a><span class="font4">. Institutional entrepreneurship is a notion in neo-institutional theory that reintroduces the interrelationship between agency, interests, and power into institutional analyses of organisations. By definition from</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> Maguire et al. (2004),</span></a><span class="font4"> institutional entrepreneurship is “activities of actors who have an interest in particular institutional arrangements and who leverage resources to create new institutions or to transform existing ones”. Earlier, </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">DiMaggio (1988) </span></a><span class="font4">argued similarly that “new institutions arise when organized actors with sufficient resources see in them an opportunity to realize interests that they value highly”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Institutional actors who have the willingness to shift the practice of stakeholder engagement from a company’s strategic management tool to an accountability for wider stakeholders will have an institutional task to undertake in terms of disrupting the existing practice with the new proposed practice of stakeholder engagement</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4"> (T. B.</span></a><span class="font4"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4">Lawrence et al., 2009)</span></a><span class="font4">. For example, institutional actors in the company may wish to promote a new approach of stakeholder engagement through a corporate web forum</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">which allows wider stakeholders to participate in a co-creation of knowledge and problem solving on company’s economic, social, and environmental concerns by disrupting the existing approach which does not allow for dialogic engagement or to limit the level of stakeholder participation. In this case, management support and commitment for the new practice of stakeholder engagement is very necessary for the institutional work to be successful. However, in many cases, a new idea aimed at an ideal practice has barriers which come from those who are in comfort zone and/or those who are risk averse or have difficulty accepting unpopular ideas. Institutional work requires time, emotion, commitment, energy, and financial support; therefore, it is fruitful to study the story of actors willing to create, maintain, and/or disrupt institutions in their companies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting is expected to contribute to more meaningful sustainability reports, not only for the reporting companies but also stakeholders. In practice, engagement with stakeholders is interpreted and practiced in various ways but usually lies on a continuum between two ends, i.e., stakeholder engagement as strategic management tools (strategic perspective) and accountability mechanism to wider stakeholders (holistic perspective). Institutional actors in the reporting companies should promote stakeholder engagement approaches which shift the practice from strategic to holistic engagement. The institutional work of actors in disrupting existing stakeholder engagement practices plus introducing new and more holistic engagement practices indeed requires skill, strategy, and passion. A shift in along the continuum of stakeholder engagement from a strategic to a holistic perspective may contribute to more meaningful sustainability reports for reporting companies and stakeholders. Stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting should be viewed as an ongoing process involving planning, implementing, and controlling stage of dialogic engagement between a reporting company and its stakeholders about sustainability issues, initiatives, performance, and agenda. Stakeholder engagement is a venue for a co-creation of new knowledge and problem solving on sustainability which becomes a common interest for both the preparers and the users of sustainability reports. Stakeholder engagement will only result in more meaningful sustainability reports when it is based on a continuous clear-scope dialogic and agreed decision-making processes with stakeholders on recent material sustainability issues by which a reporting company along with its stakeholders should have strong commitment to integrate sustainability issues into company’s strategy, governance, and operation and disseminate the agreed sustainability topics into sustainability reports transparently.</span></p>

First, sustainability reporting is voluntary in most countries and sustainability reporting frameworks (e.g., GRI Standards, AA1000 SES) exert normative influences (what ought to be reported) rather than coercive forces (what must be reported, with sanctions for the non-compliance). Second, the neo-institutional theory assumes the non-conformity response to institutional influences/forces. The theory implies that the global conception of stakeholder engagement introduced by the sustainability reporting frameworks may be perceived differently when it is translated into local contexts. These limitations suggest that the conceptual framework in</span><a href="#bookmark9"><span class="font4"> Figure 1.</span></a><span class="font4"> needs to be adapted into companies or countries’ local contexts, instead of adopting it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This paper facilitates several avenues for future research in the field of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting by exploring the relationship between approaches to such engagement, the quality of stakeholder engagement, and the meaningfulness of sustainability reports for both the preparers and users through qualitative analysis. It is fruitful to undertake empirical research in the area of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting by utilising the proposed model in </span><a href="#bookmark9"><span class="font4">Figure 1.</span></a><span class="font4"> as a conceptual framework. Several possible research questions for a future agenda of research are outlined below, but not limited to: First, what are the meanings of stakeholder engagement perceived by the reporting companies and stakeholders? Second, how do the perceived meanings of stakeholder engagement change over time? Third, how do the perceived meanings of stakeholder engagement shape their practices? Fourth, how do the reporting companies manage tension arising from diverse and conflicting interests and expectations of stakeholders? Fifth, how do dialogic stakeholder engagement practices improve the development of knowledge and understanding between the reporting company and stakeholders about sustainability issues, initiatives, performance, and agenda? Sixth, how do the reporting companies utilise internet-based forums and/or social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, among others) to engage with their stakeholders? Seventh, how do the reporting companies respond to stakeholder criticism? Eight, how do the reporting companies deal with stakeholders which have lack of voice and are not heard? Ninth, how do managers of the reporting companies introduce new stakeholder engagement approaches which are believed to be better at capturing and responding to stakeholders’ interests and expectations? Tenth, how does the inclusion of stakeholder groups into a company’s formal organisational structure affect company’s sustainability initiative, performance, and agenda? Lastly, how do stakeholder engagement practices in developing countries differ from those of in Western world?</span></p>
