<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract— </span><span class="font3">Languages in the world have its own system, specifically in verbs classification. Indonesian has two classifications in verbs, transitive and intransitive verbs. It is similar to English that there are transitive and intransitive verbs. Therefore the translation of transitive and intransitive from English into Indonesian can be done. Thus, this research is designed to analyze the Indonesian transitive and intransitive found in the translation of an Australian classic entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Possum Magic </span><span class="font3">done by BIPA (Indonesian for Non-Native Speaker) students, the translation technique used by the students in translating the transitive and intransitive verbs in the narrative text, and the problems faced by the students in translating the transitive and intransitive verbs. The data focused on the translation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Possum Magic- An Australian Classic</span><span class="font3"> from English to Indonesian done by ten students of BIPA at La Denpasar BIPA School. The method of collecting the data in this research was direct observation method. There were two techniques used in collecting the data. The first is reading the English version of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Possum Magic - An Australian Classic</span><span class="font3"> and the translation done by BIPA students. The second technique is choosing the sentences that represent the use of transitive and intransitive verbs in Indonesian. After the data collected, they were analyzed. The techniques of analyzing the data followed three steps. First, the categorization of the verbs classification was done. Then, the translation techniques used by BIPA students in translating the transitive and intransitive verbs in the narrative text were identified. Last, the problems faced by the students in translating the transitive and intransitive verbs were analyzed. The result of the research was shown that there were variations of the English transitive and intransitive verbs translation into Indonesian done by the students, those are the English transitive (ET) translated into Indonesian transitive (IT) verbs, English transitive (ET) translated into Indonesian intransitive (II), and English intransitive (EI) translated into Indonesian intransitive (II). There were two techniques used by the students to translate the transitive and intransitive verbs from English to Indonesian, they are literal technique and adaptation technique. Most of the translations were acceptable in Indonesian, but still there are some problems faced by the students in the process of translating the transitive and intransitive verbs. The problems found in this research were categorized as linguistic untranslatability that proposed by Catford (1965).</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Languages, syntactically, or perhaps semantically, are different from one another. As</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bell argues that language are different from each other; they are different in form of having distinct codes and rules regulating the construction of grammatical stretches of language (1991:6). But some languages have similarity such as verbs classification in English and Indonesian. Both of them have transitive and intransitive verbs. According to Sneddon</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">79</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/40696-2.png" alt="" style="width:68pt;height:37pt;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(2000) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transitive verb is a verb which occurs in a transitive clause. Transitive clause is a verbal clause which has an object and which contains a transitive verb. It is the opposite of the intransitive verbs. Intransitive verb is a verb which occurs in an intransitive clause (2000:xiii). Intransitive clause is a verbal clause which does not have an object and which contains an intransitive verb.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Because of their similarity in terms of verbs classification, the translation of transitive and intransitive verbs in English and Indonesian is possible to do. Translation could be defined as converting one language (Source Language) to another (Target Language) so that the target language could convey the intended message in source language. As Larson (1998) stated that in translation the form of the source language (SL) is replaced by the form of the receptor language (RL).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Considering the possibility of the translation of transitive and intransitive verbs in English and Indonesian, this research was attempted to; (1) examine how Indonesian transitive and intransitive verbs in the translation of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Possum Magic – An Australian Classic </span><span class="font4">are done by BIPA students, (2) identify which translation techniques are used by the students to translate the transitive and intransitive verbs in the narrative text, and (3) analyze the problems faced by the students in translating the transitive and intransitive verbs. The data on this research was taken from an Australian classic entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Possum Magic</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The methods in this research covered four points of discussion, namely research approach, the data source, method and technique of collecting data, and method and technique of analyzing data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The technique of analyzing data in this research used qualitative approach. In qualitative research, inquirers employ theory as a broad explanation (Creswell, 2009). Some qualitative studies present descriptive research of the central phenomenon. Qualitative approach is used because it deals with explaining data descriptively. In addition, the goal of this research is examining the entity of the data and giving explanation verbally. For instance, the collected data classified according to the Indonesian verbs classifications, transitive or intransitive verbs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The data in this study was taken from the BIPA (Indonesian for Non-Native Speaker) students’ translation of English narrative text entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Possum Magic</span><span class="font4">. Possum Magic is an Australian classic written by Australian Author Mem Fox. It is about two main characters, they are Grandma Poss and Hush. Hush has been made invisible by Grandma to protect her from Australian bush dangers. The story details the duo’s adventures as they tour across Australia searching for the magic food that will make Hush visible once more. The narrative text is in English and it was translated into Indonesian by ten BIPA students. The students are still studying Indonesian in BIPA school namely La Denpasar. It is located in Jl. Panglima Besar Sudirman, Kompleks Pertokoan Sudirman Agung, Blok A37, Dauh Puri Klod, West Denpasar-Bali. Ten students were chosen to translate the narrative text in order to examine the Indonesian transitive and intransitive found in their translations, to identify the translation technique used by the students in translating the transitive and intransitive verbs in the narrative text, and to analyze the problems faced by the students in translating the transitive and intransitive verbs. The ten students chosen were the students who have got Indonesian grammar subject in the class. In this case, their level is Intermediate MidIntermediate High (based on ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Method and technique of collecting the data in this study deals with two things, the method and the technique. The data of this study is collected through qualitative observation method. Qualitative observations are those in which the researcher takes field notes on the behavior and activities of individuals at the research site (Creswell, 2009:181). It observes written material based on printed-out texts. It is observed directly through the BIPA students’ translation. There were two techniques used in collecting the data. They are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading. To read the English version of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Possum Magic - An Australian Classic</span><span class="font4"> and the translation done by BIPA students.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing. To choose the sentences represented the use of transitive and intransitive verbs in Indonesian.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">After the data collected, they were analyzed. The data which analyzed also deals with the method and the technique. The method used in analyzing the data is descriptive qualitative method. Data analysis involves collecting open-ended data, based on asking</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">general questions and developing an analysis from the information supplied by participants (Creswell, 2009:184). The techniques of analyzing the data followed three steps.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Categorizing. The categorization of the verbs classification was done, whether it belongs to transitive or intransitive and why</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">In this section, the translation of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Possum Magic</span><span class="font4"> done by those ten students of BIPA at La Denpasar BIPA School is analysed. There are thirty data found in the students’ translation, but there are only four data used as the representative data in this research. In each data the translation of transitive and intransitive verbs from English to Indonesian was analysed. Then the translation techniques used in translating those verbs were identified. Last, the problems faced by the students in translating the transitive and intransitive verbs were analysed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">lived</span><span class="font4"> in data 1 belongs to transitive verb in English. It is because the verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">lived </span><span class="font4">used with an</span><a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/subjects-and-objects"><span class="font4"> object </span></a><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">two possums</span><span class="font4"> that refers to the Australian bush that is affected by the action of the verb. However, it is translated into intransitive in Indonesian. It becomes </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">hidup. </span><span class="font4">The verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">hidup</span><span class="font4"> is followed by preposition di which is a sign of intransitive. Also, there is no object or patient following the verb. This translation is acceptable since it succeeds to get the closest natural equivalent in the target language, although the translator changes the sentence</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">structure. In this case is changing the English transitive verb into Indonesian intransitive verb. The word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">lived</span><span class="font4"> in the data 1 is translated into </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">hidup.</span><span class="font4"> The translation technique used in this translation is literal translation. It is because it considered as word per word translation. The translator did not get any problems in translating the verbs since his translation is acceptable in the target language. Based on London Institute of Linguistic (in Hasnawi, 2003), this is happened because the translator has practical experience in translating from related fields which is beneficial in avoiding the problems.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">thought</span><span class="font4"> in data 2 is not followed by an object, so that it belongs to intransitive verb in English. It is translated into intransitive in Indonesian, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">berpikir-pikir. Berpikir-pikir</span><span class="font4"> is intransitive verb with prefix </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ber-</span><span class="font4"> and has base reduplication. The verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">berpikir-pikir</span><span class="font4"> does not have an object or patient, so it categorized as intransitive verb in Indonesian. The translator used the translation technique of adaptation in translating verb. Based on Molina and Albir (2000), he replaced the source language cultural element with one from the target culture. In English culture the verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">thought and thought</span><span class="font4"> means to act completely in thinking of something. It is translated into </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">berpikir-pikir</span><span class="font4"> which has </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ber</span><span class="font4">- base reduplication form in Indonesian. In Indonesian, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ber-</span><span class="font4"> base reduplication means a manner of action or circumstances to form verbs which mean totally under the influence of the conditions which exist. It has similar concept both in source language and target language, so that the translation is acceptable due to adaptation technique. The translator did not get any problems in translating the verbs since his translation is acceptable in the target language. Based on London Institute of Linguistic (in Hasnawi, 2003), this is happened because the translator has practical experience in translating from related fields which is beneficial in avoiding the problems.</span></p>

The translator used the literal technique, because it is word per word translation, but he fails to present the translatability of the verb. The inability of the translator in presenting the linguistic translatability of the verb is also called as linguistic untranslatability. According to London Institute of Linguistics, it is caused by the translator doesn’t have a sense of discrimination in order to decide the most suitable equivalent term from the literature of the field or from dictionaries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It is found an empirical novelty in this research. It contributes to the development of the translation studies in applied linguistics. The empirical novelty found in this research is the new variation of transitive and intransitive translation from English into Indonesian. The new variation is English transitive (ET) translated into Indonesian intransitive (II). This translation is acceptable since it succeeds to get the closest natural equivalent in the target language, although the translator changes the sentence structure. This statement was supported by the theory from Nida and Taber (1982) whose stated that translating consists of reproducing in the receptor language the closest natural equivalent of the source language message, first in terms of meaning and secondly in terms of style. The texts in different languages can be equivalent in different degreed in respect of context, semantics, grammar, lexis, etc. In addition, the equivalence occurred at different ranks. Based on London Institute of Linguistic (in Hasnawi, 2003), this is happened because the translator has practical experience in translating from related fields which is beneficial in avoiding the problems.</span></p>

This study is only concerned with translation of English fable entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Possum Magic- An Australian Classic </span><span class="font4">into Indonesian. According to the result of analysis of this study, it may consider that this study should be continued by the researcher in the future, since the Indonesian transitive and intransitive verbs form are rich in many details and variations to analyze. The results of other researches can also contribute to the development of linguistics in general and translation studies in particular.</span></p>
