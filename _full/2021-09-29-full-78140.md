This study used documentation method in collecting the data. The data were colected through three steps: first, downloading the data from the internet; second, watched and listened carefully the music and continued to read the song lyrics repeatedly; third, finding the sign of meaning and classified the data according to their type; and for the last part, the message that stand behind the sign were analyzed. The data was using the descriptive qualitative method based on the analysis and the theory of visual communication elements proposed by Dyer (1993) and the theory of meaning proposed by Leech (1974).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menemukan pemakaian dari elemen-elemen komunikasi visual dan verbal serta korelasi antar elemen-elemen visual dan representasi verbal dengan makna dari sebuah lagu. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode dokumentasi untuk mengumpulkan data, melalui tiga langkah pengumpulan data yaitu yang pertama, mengunduh data melalui internet, kedua, menyaksikan dan mendengarkan data dengan seksama dilanjutkan dengan membaca lirik lagu secara berulang-ulang, ketiga, menemukan tanda dan mengklasifikasi data sesuai dengan tipenya dan akhirnya, pesan yang tersirat dalam tanda tersebut dapat di observasi. Data telah di analisis dengan menggunakan metode deskriptif kualitatif berdasarkan teori mengenai elemen-elemen visual yang dikemukakan oleh Dyer (1993) dan teori mengenai makna yang dikemukakan oleh Leech (1974).</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Language is an important aspect in order to communicate through spoken or written ways. Meanwhile, communication means a process of exchange information between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs or behavior. Chandler (2001: 10) state that visual sign represent a picture, to highlight the products, logo of company etc. Communication is also one of the most significant way to understand each other. Visual sign has the key elements to support communication because it can be conveyed lots of things through the representation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The use of the whole elements in order to support the verbal and visual communication in a clip can be clearly seen that a video clip that has strong meaning can be used used more visual communication elements rather than the one that has no story. From the analysis of the song lyrics which contain a message, we can found that visual and verbal communication have important impact in order to convey the message of the song even though the kind of song is a rap song. Through the observation, it is easier to understand what the music video clip need to conveyed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Guo (2017) in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Arts and Humanities </span><span class="font2">discussed about discourse analysis of advertisement based on visual-grammar. The research aimed to present the correlation between semiotic with the multimodal discourse analysis affected and reflected each other. Ming Yang (2016) in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Arts and Humanities</span><span class="font2"> also discussed about semiotic analysis. He adopted grounded theory and ethnography with applied semiotic theory to analyze the semiotic meanings of the auspicious images of Taiwanese folk region temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Knox (2007) in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">SAGE International Journals </span><span class="font2">discussed about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Visual-Verbal Communication on the Home Pages of Three English-Language Online Newspapers from Different National Cultures</span><span class="font2">. Koller (2008) also in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">SAGE International Journals</span><span class="font2"> wrote a topic about the function of color as a sign of gender and sexuality in cultural models and how the information about multimodal text also exist. The supporting semiotic forms in this article is semiotic on social and cognitive semantic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus, many researches were deal with semiotics especially in visual and verbal communication, for instance in 2016 Butchart has done a research entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Communicology of Roland Barthes’ Camera Lucida: Reflections on the Sign-Body Experience of Visual Communication.</span><span class="font2"> This research used theory of Roland Barthes’ classic book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography</span><span class="font2"> and currently discuss about communicology research. This research also stands an interpretation of the description of Barthes’ semiotic phenomenology of communication. The interpretation of the data showed on Jean Luc Nancy’s philosophy which consisting on three emergent themes in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Camera Lucida: the unseen, exposure, and death. </span><span class="font2">The discussion of these themes from a communicology perspective deepens our understanding of visual communication as a sign-body experience.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Material And Method</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The study is focused on analyzing sign and meaning of visual and verbal communication in music video clip. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Drake’s Clip entitled God’s Plan</span><span class="font2"> was chosen as the data source in this study. This video was chosen as the data source to this study because it well known as the most favorite world-wide and the most consumed video and song in January 2018. Also, this</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">music video clip reached a special history as a number one US Billboard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The method of documentation was used in collecting data of this recent study, which is the data was collected by downloading through the internet. There were three steps of collecting data, first, download the video clip on YouTube. Second, watch and listen carefully the data and continue to read repeatedly the song lyrics.

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical Basis</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">This study were used theory of visual communication elements that proposed by Dyer (1993) and the theory of meaning proposed by Leech (1974). There were several articles which discussed about semiotics especially on sign and meaning that relevant to this study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Kartika (2016) wrote an article entitle </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Verbal and Visual Signs on Airlines Advertisements: A Semiotic Study.</span><span class="font2"> This study was discussing about the form of visual aspects in Garuda Indonesia and Singapore Airlines that found in the video of their advertisement. The data were chosen because both the advertisement has good visual quality and become the representative of the best airlines in Asia. There were two theories used in this study. The first theory proposed by Dyer (1993) about visual communication elements in a book entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Advertising as Communication</span><span class="font2"> also the theory of meaning proposed by Leech (1974) which titled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Semantic</span><span class="font2">. This study chose a video clip and its song lyrics as the data source which make the study different. However, this previous study used the same theory to analyze the data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brent (2009) in his article entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Journal of the Semiotic Society of America</span><span class="font2"> from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The American Journal of Semiotics</span><span class="font2"> focused with general subject of sign system. He discovered communication and culture experienced. Different from this study which chose the data source from a video clip and its song lyrics. It is also different with the theory used with this study. There are no methodological restrictions found in this article, and the suggestion for this article it is very important to collect a semiotic theory and method relevant to this study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Astawa (2017) wrote an article entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Visual and Verbal Signs of Popular Anime Characters Memes</span><span class="font2">.

This undergraduate thesis used Semiotic theory which derived from Saussure to analyze the first problems about sign features in real character in meme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another article from Machin (2010) in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">SAGE International Journals</span><span class="font2"> the author wrote about an analysis of the semiotic used by the designers of British World War 1 monuments. This study focused to the meaning of several monuments of world war and the relations with the other factors such as political, social and the context of monuments. The review or the philosophy that used in this study comes from a letter from O’Toole’s which discussed about functional analysis (1994) of sculptures, the characteristics of the monuments and also found the textual analysis that has limitation. This study has different theory and also data source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Okta Prawiranatha (2018) discussed about the meaning and function of verbal and visual signs of advertisement in a magazine. There were three selected data to support the study analysis of this article. The differences of this study is, this study analyze only the conceptual meaning on the verbal communication analysis.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Furthermore, the analysis of the verbal representation of the meaning, it was found that there were three types of meaning used namely conceptual meaning, connotative meaning and affective meaning. The other types of meaning, such as stylistic meaning, reflective meaning, collocative meaning, and thematic meaning are not found because the findings doesn’t match with the data. The analysis is based on real point of view of individual judgment without asking the writer or the singer itself.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/78140-10.jpg" alt="" style="width:188pt;height:107pt;">
<p><span class="font2">(Scene 01:15 minutes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This scene presents five similar visual components that strongly support “God’s Plan” that mentioned several times above. The picture above clearly shows when the singer or Drake give tuition fee for scholarship to a person who needed the most in Miami.
