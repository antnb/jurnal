<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">This study aimed at determining impoliteness strategies in a talk show entitled Deddy Corbuzier podcast on YouTube. In this research, the researchers used a theory from Culpeper (1996). The researcher used qualitative method to analyse the impoliteness strategies in this study. This research used impoliteness strategies. The data source of the research was the talk show Deddy Corbuzier podcast on YouTube. This research contained utterances from the conversational dialogues in the talk show. Each utterance had several types of impoliteness strategies. In collecting data, this research used the non-participatory technique and observation method by Sudaryanto (2015). Next, the data analyzed with the pragmatic identification method. This research found 15 data examined from the type of impoliteness strategy and the results were divided into bald on record impoliteness (5 data), positive impoliteness (4 data), negative impoliteness (3 data), mock politeness or sarcasm (2 data), withhold politeness (1 data). The most common strategy used by Deddy Corbuzier podcast on YouTube was bald on record impoliteness.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Human and language are two inseparable items, without which human language is a statue that cannot carry out activities, where language is also useful for conveying ideas, emotions, and desires that are suddenly or voluntarily carried out by the human being (Sapir, 2004), it means that language has a very strong influence on human life, it can also be said to be very inherent to humans so that through language, the words issued by humans can express themselves. One of the related phenomena can be seen in a video podcast on YouTube the title is Deddy Corbuzier Podcast on June 26, 2021.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Uya( speaker): “Then, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">why did you say my son, wear a wibu shirt, use deodorant first so he does not smell like onions?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Denise (hearer): “I remind you; I've never insulted your son smelling of onions?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Uya (speaker):” but the context of your words, the direction to my son” (00:04:33- 00:05:05).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the conversation above, it can be concluded that the sentence is impoliteness in language because in the conversation the speaker feels that the listener has mocked his child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Impoliteness is not only encountered when talking directly to someone, but can also be encountered when watching a movie, in a commercial, or from a religious show on television or YouTube, human will find words that use language that is not polite even when people share messages with someone, friends, sometimes without realizing the language is not polite. According to Culpeper, (1996) there are five strategic points in impoliteness: 1. Bald on record impoliteness, 2. positive impoliteness, 3. negative impoliteness, 4. sarcasm or pretend politeness, and 5. restraining politeness. On the five strategies above, the researchers focused on negative impoliteness to understand and to become a necessity to understand the meaning of the phenomenon to be studied. Language impoliteness is currently being done very deliberately by containing inappropriate words or with unpleasant language so the listener's face uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Research on impoliteness was done by some researchers. Erza &amp;&nbsp;Hamzah, (2018) examined the strategy of impoliteness used by haters on Instagram comment artists using a pragmatic approach which aimed to find the type of impoliteness strategic and the result that the researcher found 200 comments in the artist's comment column, from the analysis of these comments there is 5 strategic impoliteness in it, namely: bald on record impoliteness, positive impoliteness. Negative impoliteness, sarcasm, or mock politeness, withhold politeness. Alias &amp;&nbsp;Yahaya (2019) found 2 problems that occurred. The first, this negative impoliteness was the most dominant type of nasty strategy used in their comments on the issue. The second, dominant type of impoliteness strategy used sarcasm or mock politeness, followed by bald-on record strategy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the previous research, there were similarities and differences from the research conducted. The similarities of the two previous research used by Culpeper's (1996) theory to explain impoliteness strategies. The second, this research used an observational qualitative method with a non-participatory technique by Sudaryanto (2015). The difference between the two previous researches used different data sources. Erza &amp;&nbsp;Hamzah (2018) used Instagram comments from male-female entertainers as a data source and Alias &amp;&nbsp;Yahaya (2019) used Malaysian netizens in responding to music videos from drag queens as a data source.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face Threatening Acts</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">C.Levinson &amp;&nbsp;Steven (1987) explained that the Face Threatening Act (FTA) is an unpleasant action that aims to make inconvenience to the interlocutor. Brown and Levinson in Stockwell (2002 p.23) divided into two types of FTA, namely positive face and negative face. Negative face is a desire that does not want to be limited in the actions taken while a positive face is an act to get along in a community.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politeness</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Sijabat (2020) stated politeness ought to have a bargain when the speaker conveyed the utterances to the listener who had a diverse course, age, and position.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impoliteness Strategies</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Strategies impoliteness is a way of listening to a speech that is spoken disrespectfully. This strategy created to let people know and understand how profanity can occur in a way that social interactions do. This strategy can be found in the activities that are done daily because everyone in the interaction association always used this strategy. This strategy is usually characterized by attacking faces first, throwing jokes at others, saying false remarks to others, not answering what others are asking, and saying profanity clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Culpeper (1996, p.356) strategic impoliteness is divided into five parts namely; bald on record impoliteness, positive impoliteness, negative impoliteness, sarcasm politeness, and withhold politeness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The face-threatening act (FTA) FTA is conducted in a direct, clear, unambiguous, and concise manner in circumstances where the face is irrelevant or minimized (Culpeper, 1996). in other words, this strategy is used to attack someone directly by using ambiguous words. Example: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“just tie him power pole, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the depraved human beings</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">”</span><span class="font4"> (Mara, 2018)</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“You eat </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shit</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">”</span><span class="font4"> (Chintiabela, 2017).</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>1.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positive Impoliteness</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Positive impoliteness tends to attack the positive face of others especially attacking the face of someone who has a close relationship with them to show disapproval. Such as; Ignore, snub the other fail to acknowledge the other’s presence; Exclude the other from an activity; Use obscure or secretive language; Seek disagreement, like selecting a sensitive topic (Mirhosseini et al., 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example: teacher: “Have you finished, Akbar, come here‟</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Akbar: ”</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Why it is always me, mam?” </span><span class="font4">(Dani, 2017).</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>1.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative Impoliteness</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The use of strategies is designed to damage the negative facial desires of the recipient such as demeaning, scornful, or mocking (Culpeper, 1996).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example: A: “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Beware you fat</span><span class="font4">. You can only cheat. That’s your habit‟ (Dani, 2017).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">B: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“only 1, Bill”.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>1.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarcasm Or Mock Politeness</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The FTA conducted using an insincere courtesy strategy, and thus remains a surface realization, or it could also be said to promote disharmony without openly insulting/acting disrespectfully towards the listener (Culpeper, 1996).</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Example: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">If only the prisoner just the ordinary citizen, law is not fair for its facilities</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">”</span><span class="font4"> (Mara, 2018)</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>1.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withhold Politeness</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The absence of politeness work where it would be expected such as, not giving thanks to what someone gives is an act of intentional impropriety (Culpeper, 1996). These strategies are expected when the speaker does not behave as expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example: Denise: (give a bucket of flowers)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Deddy: (</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">silent</span><span class="font4">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">when the speaker who should be thanking the listener, but the speaker is reluctant to say it and just stays silent</span><span class="font4">” (Mohammed &amp;&nbsp;Abbas, 2015).</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In this research, the researcher used a qualitative descriptive study by Creswell, (2014). The theory of research was impoliteness in Deddy Corbuzier podcast on YouTube. The purpose of this research described the type of strategic impoliteness on the utterances of research. The data collection carried out by the researchers used the observational method (Sudaryanto, 2015). The research used the technique to collect the data required to use non-participatory techniques where researchers was not directly involved in these activities. In analysing the data, the researcher used the pragmatic identity method, which was a method that analysed by Sudaryanto,(2015).</span></p>
