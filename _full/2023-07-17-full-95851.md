<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This study aims to: (i) analyze the tree diagram structure of sentence patterns found in the novel “The Good Earth”, (ii) analyze the types of translation shifts in sentence patterns in the translation process that were found in the data source. The novel entitled “The Good Earth” is a famous literary work that was written by Pearl S. Buck. It told about family life in a village in China before the world war I. This novel was the best seller at that time. This research focuses on The Syntax Analysis and Its Translation Found on Sentence Patterns in the story from novel entitled “The Good earth”. This study also focuses on analyzing the tree diagram structure and the types of translation shifts in translating from the source language into target language. The analysis applied the theory of sentence patterns that was proposed by Quirk and Greenbaum and the theory of translations shift proposed by Catford. The process of collecting data was started by reading the novel in order to understand the novel entitled “The Good Earth” and observe the data of sentence patterns that could be taken from the data source. In the method of collecting data, the novel was read in order to find out data </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">of complex sentences and simple sentence that were found in the novel.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The “Good Earth” was the story telling about the life of Wang Lung’s family who was very poor at that time. The House of Hwang a family of wealthy landowners lived in the nearby town. However, Wang Lung's future wife O-Lan lived as a slave in a village. Lung and his family then moved into a town and rent the old House of Hwang. Wang Lung wanted peace but there were always disputes, especially between his first and second sons, and particularly their wife. The researcher was interested in analyzing sentence patterns and the translations of shifts that were found in the data source. This novel was chosen as the data source by the researcher as it was the best seller novel and some data related to sentence patterns were found. The novel was in English-Indonesian version that enabled the researcher to analyze the translations shift occured in translating from the source language into target language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Subject, verb, complement, object and adverbial are part of the sentence. People used language in order to express their feeling, ideas, knowledge and thought and as the main instrument of communication. Therefore, it can not be separated from human being. Moreover, language is important to use as the way to express our feeling, respond the phenomena, share an idea, and criticize as well. Language has an important role as a mean of communication in daily life and doing interactions with each other. Language can be used as the media in doing communication with other people either in oral or written forms. Syntax can be used as the arrangement and relationship among words, phrases, and clauses that form sentences or larger</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">constructions based on grammatical rules. The set of rules, principles, and process that govern the structure of sentences are called as syntax in linguistics. Subject, verb, and object can be found in a sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sapir (1921) stated that the language is used as “a purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions and desires by means of a system. In a simple sentence, there are a subject and a verb. Moreover, Radford (1997) stated that syntax focuses on how words can be put together in order to form phrases and sentences. Syntactic patterns, syntactic construction, and system of rules are usually used to discuss in the syntax. Knowledge can be developed and know something by using language. Based on the phenomena, the researcher chooses the novel entitled “The Good Earth” as the data source because it contains few patterns that are analyzed syntactically. The researcher is interested in doing the research as there were some sentence patterns and translation shift found in the novel entitled “The Good Earth”. By doing this research, the researcher hopes that the reader gets the point and deeper information about syntactic analysis on sentence patterns and translation shift that were found in the novel entitled “The Good Earth”. Simple sentence and their translations found in the story entitled “The Good Earth” were analyzed by the researcher. The theory that was proposed by Catford (1965) was applied by the researcher in the translation analysis in analyzing about the shift in translation found in the novel “The Good Earth”. The theory of syntax and translation were chosen to analyze the data source as it gives deeper analysis related to the translation analysis discussed in this research study. Nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjective, adverbs, prepositions, and articles or determiners are then classified as English words. Morevover, Chaer and Agustina (2010:1) stated that there are two types in the factor of languages. In external factors, language has been related to other contexts. It had been seen from the various functions of language and the social situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are two reasons why the researcher chose sentence patterns and their translations as the object of this research, they are as follows: (1) examining the pattern of the sentence containing in </span><span class="font1">the novel “The Good Earth”</span><span class="font2">; (2) analyzing the sentence patterns by using tree diagram found in </span><span class="font1">“The Good Earth”</span><span class="font2">. Previous related studies on the sentence patterns were reviewed as the literary reviews. First study was written by Rahmawati (2003) entitled “A Syntactical Analysis on Sentence Patterns Used in David Forester’s Songs”. There were nineteen rules of the sentence patterns with Noun Phrase and Verb Phrase as the most common rules which were analyzed in this research study. Other common sentence patterns that consist of Noun Phrase, Verb Phrase, Preposition, Conjunction plus Verb Phrase or Noun Phrase were also analyzed in this research study. Finally, this research study stated that kernel sentences appear less than the transformed ones. The second research was written by Yulia, in her thesis (1998) entitled “Sentence Patterns Used in Michael Learns to Rock’s Pop Songs”. This research study stated that kernel sentence mostly appears rather than transformed sentences. The sentences are in the form of VP, simple sentence or two sentences that were combined with or without conjunction. This research study analyzed the substandard English words such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘bout, I’m, she’s, and I’ve</span><span class="font2">.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In the method and technique of collecting data of sentence patterns, this study applied observation and documentary analysis. The observation method was applied in this study in order to observe the entire data that contained sentence patterns in the source language and their translations in the target language found in the novel entitled “The Good Earth”. The techniques of collecting data of sentence patterns in the novel “The Good Earth” were used by doing note taking, reading and doing observation. In the process of collecting the data of sentence patterns, the data were read to know the story that was found in the data source and it was continued to observe the possibility of the data that were taken from data source. First, the entire story of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">novel “The Good earth” were read to get the data of sentence patterns and analyzed the syntactic structure by using tree diagram by using the theory that were proposed by Brown and Miller. After that, the researcher continued to get the data of sentence patterns based on the problems discussed in this research study. The sentence patterns found in the data source and its syntactic structure were analyzed by using the tree diagrams. Finally, it was continued to analyze the types of translation shifts of relative clauses occurred in the translation of the novel entitled “The Good Earth”. Sentence patterns are stated as the way to build sentences. Structure categories of each lexical item were classified by sentence patterns. Tree diagram is used to analyse the internal structure of words and phrases in sentence patterns found in the data source. O’Grady, Dobrovolsky, and Katamba’s (1996, p. 734) stated that the diagram “represents the details of a word or phrase’s internal structure”. Moreover, according to Radford (1997, p. 533) tree diagram is “a way of representing the syntactic structure of a phrase or sentence. The tree diagram can be used as a suitable means of showing the internal structure of sentences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Phrase structure explains about how the word can be built up the phrase and how the sentences can be structured out of phrase. It can be seen in the following rules. The example of phrase structure rules is described in constituent structure as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">S ----------H X Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The constituent structure is placed on left side. The components can be seen on the right side. The structure rules explain that the sentence consists of noun phrase and verb phrase. X and Y consist of two constituents of S. There are some forms of phrasal categories, for example PP, AP, NP, VP, ADVP. A set of elements forming a constituent can be called as phrase. There is a head noun in noun phrase.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">It was a good omen</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It can be seen from the structure in the simple sentence </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">It was a good omen</span><span class="font1"> that the simple sentence has the constituent structure of NP and VP. The VP consists of auxiliary and noun phrase. We can see from the structure as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">S-------► NP VP</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">VP -------► &nbsp;auxiliary NP</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It can be seen from the constituent structure in sentence pattern in datum 1 that structure shift occured in the translation proccess as there is a change of the position of word structure in both languages without changing the meaning of the message in the source language. As a part of simple sentence pattern, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a good omen</span><span class="font2"> in the source language was translated into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pertanda baik</span><span class="font2"> in the target language. It can be seen from the translation of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a good omen</span><span class="font2"> which is constructed by modifier (adjective, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a good</span><span class="font2">) + head (noun, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omen</span><span class="font2">) and translated into head (noun, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pertanda</span><span class="font2">) + modifier (adjective, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">baik</span><span class="font2">). Therefore, there is change of the position of word structure </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a good omen</span><span class="font2"> into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pertanda baik</span><span class="font2"> without changing the meaning of the message of the source language.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">By looking at the tree diagram in datum 2 in the sentence </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The fields needed rain for fruition</span><span class="font1">, it can be seen from the text that unit shift occurred in the process of translation. A translation shift of a word into a phrase occurred in the translation process in datum 2. As a part of simple sentence, a word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fruition</span><span class="font1"> was translated into a phrase </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">padi dapat tumbuh</span><span class="font1">. The translation equivalent in the target language occurs at a different rank into a phrase </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">padi dapat tumbuh</span><span class="font1">. This type of shift is called as unit shift that is a change in higher rank translated from a noun </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fruition</span><span class="font1"> into a phrase </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">padi dapat tumbuh</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This research study focuses on analyzing the tree diagram structure and the types of translation shifts in translating from the source language into target language. The analysis applied the theory of sentence patterns proposed by Quirk and Greenbaum and the theory of translations shift that was proposed by Catford. The process of collecting data was started by reading the novel in order to understand the novel entitled “The Good Earth” and observe the data of sentence patterns from the data source. In the method of collecting data, the novel was read in order to find out data of complex sentences and simple sentence found in the novel. The research study found that there were seven sentence patterns that were translated by applying unit shift and structure shift. The data were analyzed based on syntax analysis, types of sentences, sentence pattern, tree diagram, and relevant previous studies. It can be seen for example in datum 8 in the sentence </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Wang Lung stopped</span><span class="font1"> that unit shift occurred in the process of translation. A translation shift of a word into a phrase was implied in the translation process in datum 8. As a part of simple sentence, a verb </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stopped</span><span class="font1"> was translated into a phrase </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">berhenti melamun</span><span class="font1">. The translation equivalent in the target language occurs at a different rank into a phrase </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">berhenti melamun</span><span class="font1">. This type of shift is called as unit shift that is a change in higher rank that was translated from a word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stopped</span><span class="font1"> into a phrase </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">berhenti melamun</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
