The purpose of this study was to calculate the absolute quantity of leucocytes components of mice Mus musculus L as a biological indicator of Co60 gamma ray The sample of mice were grouped into 4 control treated with Co60 gamma ray without adaptation treated with Co60 gamma ray with adaptation I and treated with Co60 gamma ray with adaptation II In the treatment without adaptation mice were treated with the doses of 10 15 20 25 dan 30 Gy In ad
