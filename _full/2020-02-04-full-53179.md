<p><span class="font1">Bali is an island in Indonesia that is rich in culture, an example of that culture is the traditional dance. The traditional dance performance is diverse from one village to another village in Bali. The traditional Balinese dance knowledge should be captured dan documented well in a digital form so that it can be shared easily to different people and generations across the world. The use of ontology as an information representation technique is the preferred solution in this matter because ontology can be used to enhance the development of semantic applications, especially when dealing with semantic webs. In this project, the ontology was built using the Protege ontology development tool. We follow the methontology ontology development method where this methodology clearly describes each of its activities. In this study, we focus to describe variants of Balinese traditional dance. In the future, we expect that more types of dance can be documented using our proposed ontology.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Bali is one of the islands in Indonesia and has many internationally recognized panoramas. Besides that, it turns out that Bali has a myriad of cultural wealth, including traditional Balinese dances. The diversity of information regarding the various types of dance in Bali must be well described. The use of ontology as an information representation technique is the choice of the solution in this problem. Ontology on the semantic web is a catalog where the scheme uses ontology. Ontology is needed to enhance the development of semantic applications, especially on the company's semantic web, which consists of the application of semantic technology in a corporate environment. In the preparation of this ontology, it will be built using the methontology method, methontology is one of the methodologies of developing an ontology model, where this methodology has advantages related to the description of each activity that must be carried out in detail. In addition, methontology also has the ability that the built ontology can be reused for further system development. Therefore, a study is proposed to build an ontology model that represents the domain of knowledge about dance in Bali. This research is expected to be able to build ontology models that have good design quality by utilizing the methontology methodology so that it can be further implemented in the semantic web model.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Ontology is a way to represent the knowledge of a set of concepts in an information domain and the relationship between those concepts, so that ontology can be used to present information semantically also to organize and map a collection of information resources in a systematic and structured manner. This is very useful in terms of data interoperability because it can be done more effectively and efficiently [3]. There are several benefits in using the ontology, such as being able to explain a domain of knowledge explicitly, providing a hierarchical structure of concepts to explain a domain and how they related. In order to share an understanding of structured information and reuse the domain of knowledge, for example, we want to build a broad ontology, we can develop an existing ontology and integrate it with several other</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ontologies that are relevant to the ontology to be built [1-4] .</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The semantic web is an approach that was developed specifically on web technology. Semantic Web and Semantic Web technologies provide us with a new approach to managing information and process, as a creation and the use of semantic metadata. As information, metadata divided into two levels. First, explaining documents, for example, web pages or parts of documents, such as paragraphs. On the other hand, describing the entity in the document, for example, a person or company. However, what is important is that the metadata is semantic, which provides knowledge about the contents of the document (eg the subject, or relationships with other documents) or about the entities in the document [1] .</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Protege software was developed by the Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Protege software is an open source under license called Mozilla Public License (MPL). Protege software is a tool to help ontology developers to develop systems based on the Knowledge Base called System knowledge base. Protege can create, edit and save ontologies in CLIPS, RDF, XML, UML and Relational Database formats. In general, protégé makes it easy for users to make basic modeling in a simpler way that is complemented by visualization of SubClass relationships in Tree map [6] .</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">SPARQL Query is a query language for RDF. RDF Graph is composed of scripts which are formed from Subjects, Predicates and Objects. RDF can be defined in RDF Concepts and Abstract Concept Syntax. This triple can come from a variety of sources. In instance can be obtained directly from the RDF document, can be stored in the RDF script standard. RDF expressions can be stored in other formats such as XML and Relational Database. SPARQL is a query language for getting information from RDF Graph. which provides facilities such as extracting information in the form of URIs, Blank Nodes and Literals, extracting RDF Subgraphs and constructing new RDF Graphs based on query graphs [6] .</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Ontology classification of traditional dance in Bali which was built with software Protege 5.5.0 Build Beta-9 produced 11 classes, 3 object properties and 3 property data and 54 individuals. In the research above shows that the application of ontology in the case of classifying traditional dance types in bali, able to provide information well and in accordance with user requests and can represent the knowledge of a set of concepts in an information domain and the relationship between these concepts, so that the presentation of information can be done in a semantics where the mapping of information resources collection becomes systematic and structured. In the future, this research will work on the quality of ontology, especially in the classification of traditional dances because the data that continuously develop makes this research interesting to develop. Considering that ontology can also be developed from existing ontologies and integrated with several other relevant ontologies into the ontology to be developed that can be implemented into a semantic web-based system.</span></p>
