<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Introduction</span><br><br><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Background</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">Service is a very important tool in tourism activities, not only as a departure and arrival facilities people travel frequently but also with</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">regard to the image of a travel destination. Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport has just completed the development and renovation. This was done because the airport is the first contact and the last tourists encountered while on vacation to a destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Therefore, the airport facilities are a source of the first and last impression that affect the quality expectations of the tourists on holiday activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Increased tourist arrivals to Bali occurs because the appeal of nature and culture for tourists. In addition, the increase also occurs because of infrastructure and other facilities continues to grow. Ngurah Rai Airport just expand and improve its facilities with the funds of Rp 2.8 trillion, which includes the expansion of arrival and departure terminals of domestic and international. With the completion of the renovation of the Ngurah Rai Airport in 2013, increasing its capacity from 14 million passengers to 25 million passengers, an increase of 78.57%. This figure is the largest airport capacity in Indonesia today. (Special Class I Immigration Office Ngurah Rai Bali, 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bali as a world class tourism destination to develop and renovate the Ngurah Rai International Airport in order to improve the quality of its services to provide a higher satisfaction for tourists visiting Bali. Besides improving the quality of service at Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport is expected to raise the image of Bali tourism, which in turn may increase the loyalty of tourists to visit Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To continue to increase tourist arrivals, the government has issued Presidential Regulation No. 69 Year 2015 regarding Visa Free visits. In the second article explained that the visit Visa Exemption granted to a Foreigner nationals of certain countries and the government of the special administrative regions of certain countries with regard to the principle of reciprocity and the principle of benefit. According to this regulation, Foreign nationals of certain countries are exempted from the obligation to have a visit visa to enter Indonesian territory in order to visit Travel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Service is a very important tool in tourism activities, not only as a departure and arrival facilities people travel frequently but also with regard to the image of a travel destination. According to Martín-Cejas (2006) airport is not the final destination of the tour, but the airport is only a transit point between the place of origin of tourists to a tourist destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus, the airport will bring traveler's first impression will be a tourist destination visited. Therefore, existing services at the airport as a whole, must be able to foster a positive image of a tourist destination and according to result of Airport Council International (ACI) about Airport Service Quality (ASQ) that’s Ngurah Rai International Airport the best third in the world with category 15 million until 25 million passangers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The image of a tourist destination is one of the reasons tourists to visit these destinations. The existing image in the minds of tourists is not always in tune with the real conditions of the destination itself so, the image of the destination has the potential to affect the least competitive destination. (LeBlanc and Nguyen, 1996). Travel image actually can be formed from a set of beliefs, ideas, inspiration, perception and attitude of a person who obtained tourists on a tourist area (Weisesa, 2008).</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Literature Review</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">Consumer satisfaction is a particular response from consumers as a result of the evaluation of the gap between expectations and performance products Giesel &amp;&nbsp;Cote (cited by Manurung, 2009). While Mowen and Minor (2002) states that consumer satisfaction is an overall attitude shown consumers for goods or services after they obtain and use. It is an evaluative assessment post-election caused by the selection of special purchase and experience of using the goods or services.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Quality of Service</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">Service Quality is how far the difference between expectations and reality of the customers for the services they receive. Service Quality can be determined by comparing the perception of customers for the services they actually receive the service they expect. Quality of service becomes the main thing seriously considered by the company, which involves the entire resources of the company. To facilitate the assessment and measurement of service quality developed a service quality measurement tool called SERVQUAL (Service Quality). SERVQUAL is a multi-item scale that can be used to measure customer perceptions on the quality of services that includes five dimensions (Zeithami and Bitner, 2004).Zeithami and Bitner (2004) identified five (5 dimensions service quality are used by customers in evaluating quality of service. These five dimensions are tangible, empathy, reliability, responsiveness, and assurance.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Satisfaction Traveler</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">There are several definitions that are commonly used to describe customer satisfaction or customer satisfaction. Sadeh </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font6"> (2012) defines satisfaction as a postconsumption evaluation in which an alternative is selected at least meet or exceed expectations. In short, these alternatives should be carried out as good as or exceeds what is expected. According to Archana and Subha (2012); Kotler and Keller (2012), consumer satisfaction is feeling happy or upset someone who comes from a comparison between the impression of the performance (results) of a product with many hopes.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Citra Tourism</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">Tourism image is a person's beliefs, thoughts and impressions based on the amount or specific information about the purpose, feeling, and as a reflection of the general perception in the mind of the individual (Inan, 2010: 4). According Konecnik (2004) the image of the tourist area destination is a set of beliefs, ideas, and impressions of people at the place and purpose of the tourist area. Meanwhile, according to Lopes (2011) the image of a tourist destination is an expression that includes all the knowledge, prejudices, imagination and emotional mind an individual or group on specific tourist sites. According Konecnik (2004) image dimensions attractions include beliefs, ideas and concepts. Trust is a belief that the other party statements can be relied upon to fulfill its obligations. Distrust can occur in line with the lack of information in the planning and performance measurement.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Loyalty Traveler</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">What is meant by tourists loyalty is a commitment to defend in depth to re-purchase or come back to the area attractions or services consistently selected in the future, although the influence of the situation and marketing efforts have the potential to cause changes in traveler behavior (Mosahab, Mahamad and Ramayah, 2010; Som and Badarneh, 2011; Movafegh and Movafegh, 2013). From these definitions it can be said that the loyal customers who have some kind of fanaticism that is relatively permanent in the long term for a product / service or a company that has become the choice. While Saha and Theingi (2009) stated that it has become apparent that customer satisfaction is now no longer the key factor of success the company but customer loyalty is the key to a successful dominant business. Customer loyalty is defined as customers who are satisfied with the products or services of the company and they become a word-of-mouth advertisers who enthusiastically. He further expand the loyalty not only on the product or service, but also the whole portfolio products and services as part of a lifetime, or in other words, brand loyalty forever.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Theoretical framework</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">Frame of mind is the result and synthesis of theory and literature review associated with the problems encountered in the formulation of the research problem. Frame of mind in this study based on the premise that everything done by humans is always based on a certain motivation and interest, which will affect the individual's performance. According Sugiono (2012) in forming a theory group that needs to be put forward in the preparation of the frame of mind to make a hypothesis must be determined first research variables. In this study, there are four (4) research variables consisted of airport service quality, tourism image, tourist satisfaction and loyalty rating.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">problem is the formulation of the problem that does not have to be proved by testing the hypothesis, but explored through interviews to explain the rating opinion on the quality of service Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport, making this the sixth problem formulation does not require hypothesis.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Methodology</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">This study uses a quantitative research dat-supported by qualitative data. Quantitative research methods used to obtain the results of in-depth evaluation and comprehensive, this approach is used to handle data that is quantitative (numbers). While qualitative</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">methods are used to be based on the consideration that the symptoms of this research is a process that is done by studying the behavior or activities of the actors involved in it (Sugiyono, 2012). While in Tashakkori and Teddlie Creswell (2010: 77) argues that the results of quantitative research does not have to be a confirmation of qualitative research results, and vice versa. Most studies that use this approach to generate numerical data and narrative data in the same answer research questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The population in this study were all tourists visiting Bali through Ngurah Rai Airport at the time of the study conducted in August 2014 to March 2015. In accordance with modeling Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), has chosen sample of 348 respondents using purposive sampling technique. Data used in this research is quantitative data and qualitative data. Based on the source, the data of this study distinguished between primary data obtained from questionnaires, interviews and documentation as well as secondary data obtained from various sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Data were collected through questionnaires were analyzed using analysis techniques Equation Modeling Structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS program package SPSS version 22 and 21. After the data were analyzed with SEM structural equation model, the qualitative analysis through interviews and analysis description SERVQUAL consists of analysis of the conformity level, the analysis of customer satisfaction index and importance Performance Analysis (IPA).</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The results showed respondents with male gender as many as 185 people or 53.16%, while respondents with female sex as much as 163 people or 46.84%. This shows the male respondents is larger than the female respondents, but the difference was not significant. Respondents age 17-26 years as many as 69 people or 19.83%, 27-36 years as many as 127 people or 36.49%, 37-46 years as many as 96 people or 27.59% and the 46 years and over as many as 56 people or 16.09%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This shows that the majority of respondents in this study age was 27-36 years. The data show that the age of tourists who traveled in Bali highest is aged 27-36 years is 36.49%, followed by the age of 37-46 years is 27.59%. If the age range of 27-46 years are summed into as many as 64.08%, which means that the majority of foreign tourists to Bali has a productive age, which is trying to find a balance between work and leisure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Respondents with a description of a visit to Bali one time as many as 17 people or 4.89%, two times as many as 23 people or 6.61%, three times as many as 124 people or 35.63%, four times as many as 32 people or 9.20%, 5 times as many as 89 people or 25.57% and&gt; 5 times as many as 63 people or 18.10%. This shows that the majority of respondents in this study has a description of a visit to Bali three times, this is possible given the multiple increase in the quality of the existing infrastructure in the island tourist attraction, thus increasing the interest of tourists to visit. Based on the above data it can be seen foreign tourists visiting Bali more than 3 times in the top 89%. The reason they continue to visit Bali, among others: The appeal of Bali tourism and the improvement of facilities and infrastructure at Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport. While the origin of tourists who were respondents in Asia include as many as 84 people or 24.14%, Australia 98 people or 28.16%, of Europe as many as 77 people or 22.13%, USA as many as 53 people or 15.23% and the other 36 people sebnyak or 10.34%. Based on this it can be concluded that the majority of respondents in this study merupawan tourists who come from Australia, this is possible given the distance between Bali and Australia are not too far away, so tourists it easier to fill the vacation time.</span></p>

Thus, the hypothesis 1 (H1): &quot;Quality of service Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport is a positive effect on tourist satisfaction and the image of Bali Tourism&quot; supported (unacceptable). The results support the research conducted RP and Sinambela (2011) concluded that the quality of services provided Snowbay Waterpark TMII proved positive and significant impact on customer satisfaction Snowbay Waterpark this area. This means that the quality of services provided to the satisfaction felt by both customers Snowbay Waterpark. Movafegh and Movafegh research (2013) shows that service quality has positive influence on customer satisfaction in the tourism industry. The same is also evidenced by Ali and Howaidee (2012); Hossain (2012); Al-Abneh (2013) who concluded the service quality in the tourism destination affects the tourist satisfaction. Parasuraman (2009)(Parasuraman, 2009) noted with satisfaction as a customer evaluation of the service in relation to whether the service can meet the needs and expectations. Satisfaction can be associated with feelings of pleasure (pleasure) to services. It means that customer satisfaction is the degree to which the perceived service quality to meet expectations if the quality of service below expectations, customers feel dissatisfied. If performance meets expectations, then the customer is satisfied.
