Objective ACTH410Pro8Gly9Pro10 and HMG CoA reductase inhibitor had a wellknown neuroprotective effects One important process happened in head injury is apoptotic neuronal death Bcl2 is one of antiapoptotic protein inhibits the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis This study aimed to compare the effect of standard therapy ACTH410Pro8Gly9Pro10 and HMG CoA reductase inhibitor on serum Bcl2 levels and the potential effect to a better outcome and reduction of ho
