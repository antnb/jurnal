Lactic acid bacteria LAB is a microorganism that is not toxic and able to produce antimicrobial compounds namely bacteriocins This study aims to determine the physicochemical characterization of bacteriocins origin originated from lactic acid bacteria isolates 17B isolated from colon Bali cattle The research was started by recultivation of isolates 17B and continued with production and precipitation of bacteriocins Further tests were chemical and physical te
