Serving a delicious meal for the Sin Beng by children and grandchildren is considered the joy and happiness that is felt when welcoming the Lunar New Year. The same is also experienced by the ancestors in nature. In the moment it also held the burning of Jin Zhi (the money of the Spirit), Zhi Zha (clothing, home-Home, Mobil-mobilan), as a sign of devotion and reply to what his parents had done to his children. However, in lunar celebrations there is a uniqueness that is inversely proportional to the tradition of home cleaning, namely in the celebration of the day &quot;H&quot; is no longer allowed to sweep the house. This is related to the belief that the cleaning of the house that is done on the right of the lunar day is meant as an act that can clean all the sustenance, goodness and prosperity that has come in the house.

<p><span class="font2">how to eat food served at the dining table, the dishes served are not allowed to be spent at the time. There should be food left over. This relates to the belief containing connotations in contact with the notion that sustenance is not to be spent in an instant, but there must be a left to be saved until there is a provision for the entire family.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophical meaning behind various Chinese dishes</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">he thing that is not less interesting on the Lunar New Year celebrations in the city of Manado is colored by the presentation of various dishes are delicious. Various food dishes are usually brought to the shrine as a family offering to the Thian and the sin Beng or better known as offerings.

Offerings are a feast of various means, such as: Flowers, frankincense, money Recehan, and food, so that spirits do not disturb and obtain salvation. The offerings at home by the family also offered a variety of meals for the ancestors (Sin Beng).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The family also prepares a variety of food that will be eaten together with the entire core family and the relatives who come in. The tradition of visiting each other became a meeting event for colleagues and friends to be and increasingly lively with a variety of traditional Chinese food served at the dining table. Some of the compulsory food served at the lunar celebration itself has a philosophy that is believed by ethnic Chinese people in Manado city. The dishes provided in welcoming Chinese lunar celebrations consist of a variety of Chinese-style cakes, dishes with animal menus, fruits, long-life noodles, some sweets, and soups that are typically served. Various dishes are mandatory food that characterizes the lunar celebration. The presence of various variants of these foods becomes significant to ethnic Chinese. This is because every dish served always contains a philosophical meaning that is believed and useful for the continuity of the perpetration of the culprit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Chinese celebration of Manado is colored by various dishes that have been adapted to the situation and conditions. All adapted to the economic capabilities of local Chinese society. This is a factor that affects the changing menu of dishes for the Thian and the Sin Beng. The rules of the food presentation presented in the lunar calendar are not the same as the food of Chinese ancestral land in China.

<p><span class="font2">Chinese dishes so adapted to the ability of bites economics, Nyandak there is an element bapaksa for MO Presents, customize the bites PE materials that exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tuturan is interpreted as follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The dish is adjusted to our economic ability (people who celebrate the lunar), there is no element of compulsion in presenting it, adjusted also with the availability of materials around us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Referring to the speech in the interview then the Chinese community in Manado City can be found facts related to the presentation of various cakes, such as: Lapis legit can be replaced with cake balapis (lapis), as well as special cakes in the city Manado, such as: Nasi Jaha, Polote (cupcakes), which looks no longer should be pink or dark red but there is also a chocolate because the mixture is brown sugar. All with rice flour, my cake, kuebasket based on glutinous flour, brown sugar and coconut milk, and spices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Basket cakes are an icon for ethnic Chinese, and people outside the ethnic Chinese. Manado City community is no stranger with pastries, such as: Polote Beng, Balapis, my cake because these cakes can be found in everyday life and are always available in traditional markets and pastry shops. The other uniqueness in the process of making a basket cake is a long time ± 6 – 10 hours, hard work and persistence because at the time of its creation, stirring the cake dough basket must be patient patiently. When the process of making basket cake baskets can not speak coarse and the fruit until the basket cake thick textured, sticky, sweet. Kue lapis or by the people of Manado better known as a baltherapist cake made from a variety of basic ingredients that use variations of flour. Some are using rice flour, tapioca starch combined with sugar, coconut milk as well as food coloring, such as Suji leaves to produce green color or instant food coloring available at pastry material shops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Various cakes are usually dominated by red-colored cakes. Each pastry has a deep philosophical meaning. The meaning contained in the cake dish is usually related to sustenance, prosperity, harmony of life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Lapis cake is a symbol of hope for blessing and the sustenance that continues to come and the family is increasingly well established. While my cake symbolizes the hope of achievement of long life, and healthy always, it is preached with the shape of my cake which is very similar in shape to the turtle. Turtle is an animal that can live for 500 years, it is the basis of analogy for the philosophy of the Shewbread at the Chinese lunar celebration in Manado.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Especially for Chinese, animal-derived dishes, they are divided into three types of animals that also represent three natural elements, such as: water element,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Earth and Air. The water element is represented by the </span><span class="font0">鱼 </span><span class="font2">fish (Yú), the earth element by the </span><span class="font0">猪 </span><span class="font2">Pig (Zhū), as well as the air element represented by </span><span class="font0">雞 </span><span class="font2">Chicken (jī).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Trusted by the three elements of animals with each trait they possess, can represent a character that is often inherent in one's self. A </span><span class="font0">猪 </span><span class="font2">Pig (Zhū) is an animal that is one of the favorite dishes in the Imle celebration dish. Many people understand that the lifestyle of pigs is lazy and dirty. However, the fact about the animal's lifestyle is precisely a memorial to the ethnic Chinese, which is to be expected for someone who eats pork dishes in the lunar celebration will not be a lazy person in his life. Chicken is often called a greedy animal that is expected when a person is eating it on the lunar feast the nature of greed will disappear in his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">More about the animal offerings that represent the element of water, ethnic Chinese in the city of Manado adapting, with the environment.
