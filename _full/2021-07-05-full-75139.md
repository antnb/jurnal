<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Data 1</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Luther: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font3">what if we make a deal?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This utterance is performed when Luther tried to make a deal with Dr. Delbruk, who pretended not to recognize John Lark even though Ethan and Luther had said they had evidence of how he contacted John Lark via his phone.

<p><span class="font3">which belongs to question type here when the speaker asks the hearer/ addressee as to proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Data 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Walker: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“People fall for this shit? How do you intend to make Lark cooperate?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This conversation is performed when Ethan and Walker are on a CIA plane disguised as a commercial airplane. Before taking action to meet the white widow, Ethan explained to the walker that there is no way to meet the white widow without an identification bracelet that had an RFID number. So Ethan explained that walker had to find the bracelet with an RFID detector and with that, they could find Lark. Walker also asked how to make Lark cooperate on that tool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The utterance </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“People fall for this shit?

<p><span class="font3">Alan: “</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Good God, Ethan, don’t make this any harder than it already is.</span><span class="font3"> I can no longer protect you, don’t you understand that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The conversation took place when Alan Hunley met the IMF team in London to meet the courier who was going to deliver plutonium to them. However, who would have thought that Alan Hunley was there to tell the IMF team that White Widow’s meeting with the IMF team to exchange plutonium for Solomon lane was a trap because White Widow collaborated with the CIA. The CIA’s narrative states that Hunt defected and made the search for Lark is nothing but a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">cover to hide that Lark is Hunt. With solid evidence that Ethan has removed plutonium and Allan doesn’t want to make this harder, Allan decides that his (Ethan) search for plutonium stops here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The utterance “</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Good God, Ethan, don’t make this any harder than it already is.</span><span class="font3"> I can no longer protect you, don’t you understand that?” that was uttered by Allan Hunley is identified as directive illocutionary acts.
