<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>1)Background of the Study</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">In order to introduce their products to the public, the producer will use an advertisement to introduce their goods and services. There are many kinds of goods, services, restaurants, hotels, airline transportations, travel agents and many others. To sell and inform their products and services to all customer levels, they will use media or public communication by making an advertisement in the televisions, radios, news papers and some magazines. The printed advertisement is one of media that is often used by the seller because it influences thought, feeling, and lifestyle of the people in society in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some verbal and visual signs in the advertisement can make the people well informed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and have good memories in a product itself. It is necessary to choose and select the right a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">visual and verbal signs to for introduce the products to the public. Advertising is direct toward a mass audience with the aim of promoting sale of commercial products or services. It informs the kind, type and characteristics of the product and also offers the facilities of the public services in order to persuade the customers and create desire or need of them. By reading and seeing the advertisement, customers are persuaded to buy products and services. Printed advertisement in magazine is one of the advertisements using visual mediums. It consists of verbal and visual sign that can lead us to discover the meaning or message that it brings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In relation to those phenomena, I was interested in doing further study on interpreting the massage from verbal and visual sign on the advertisement at Now Bali Magazine by comparing two different advertisements from the products produced by different companies. This study attempts to investigate the similarities and differences of those advertisements. This magazine was published in October 2010 by Phoenix Communication Jakarta.</span></p>
