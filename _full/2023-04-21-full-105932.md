<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Bulung boni is one type of seaweed that grows in Indonesia. Bulung Boni is the regional name of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Caulerpa cylindracea</span><span class="font3">. This seaweed is usually used as a vegetable by the Balinese people. In the study of Julyasih (2009) stated the ethanol extract of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">bulung boni contains 37,249,000 µg carotenoids in 100 mg samples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Carotenoids are antioxidants that are very potential in protecting lipid membranes against peroxidation (Siems </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font3">., 2002). The use of antioxidant compounds has recently grown rapidly</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">along with the increasing knowledge of free radical activity against several degenerative diseases (Hanani </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font3">., 2005). Epidemiological studies shows that consuming antioxidants derived from natural materials such as vegetables and fruits shows protective effects against various degenerative diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer (Budiana, 2008). Therefore, bulung boni has the potential to be developed into processed food and medicine products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In processing a raw material, the content of the compounds in the material must be known. Phytochemical analysis is a test conducted to identify bioactive components in a material. Bioactive components are active compounds in functional foods that are responsible for metabolic reactions that benefit health (Subroto, 2008). In identifying phytochemical compounds, the solvent used in extraction is very influential on the content of compounds that can be identified. This is due to the principle of like dissolves like, which is a solvent tends to dissolve compounds that have the same level of polarity. Carotenoids are a group of compounds with low polarity so that to get this group of compounds used solvents with low polarity such as n-hexane. Based on the research of Wahyuni and Widjanarko</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">eISSN: 2655-9994 pISSN: 2303-3371 </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.24843/IJBB.2023.v10.i02.p06"><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">https://doi.org/10.24843/IJBB.2023.v10.i02.p06</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font3">(2015), the highest carotenoid content was produced by n-hexane solvent. N-hexane is mostly used as an organic solvent that is inert due to its non-polarity. There are several techniques used to analyze phytochemical compounds, one of which is using the GC-MS (Gas ChromatographyMass Spectrometry) method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Toxicity tests on a raw material are also very important and necessary before the material is processed into food or medicine. The existence of a toxicity test is carried out to determine the toxic effects of a compound and its capacity to affect an organism. Acute toxicity tests are part of preclinical tests designed to measure the toxic effects of a compound within 24 hours interval. The median lethal dose or LD</span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font3">is a statistical benchmark after a single dose administration that is often used to express the level of toxic dose as quantitative data. Clinical &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;symptoms, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physiological</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">symptoms and toxic mechanisms as qualitative data (Jenova, 2009).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the description above, until now there has been no report on the level of safety in the use of bulung boni and what compounds are contained in the n-hexane extract of bulung boni. So it is important to conduct toxicity testing of n-hexane extract of bulung boni and its phytochemical analysis. This is due to the possible content</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of bulung boni n-hexane extract is harmful to humans if consumed at doses that are not recommended and in long term use.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The data generated from GC-MS analysis is processed in-silico by matching the compounds in the chromatogram with the compounds in the literature. The data collected in the toxicity test research on mice is primary data from the observation of experimental animals, both control group and treatment groups. The data obtained are qualitative data and quantitative data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Qualitative data was obtained by observing the clinical symptoms experienced by the mice. Quantitative data was obtained by calculating the LD</span><span class="font1">50</span><span class="font3">, which is the number of mice that died and those that were still alive in each group.

<p><span class="font3">The experimental animals used were male mice aged 60 days. The mice used</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">were healthy as many as 24 mice with a weight 20-30 g. Mice were divided into 6 groups, namely group 1 as control and groups 2-6 as treatment groups. Previously, the mice were acclimatized first for 1 week to adapt the mice's living environment to the laboratory environment. Mice were also fed (can still be given a drink) for 14 hours before treatment. Each group of mice was put into 1 cage. Each group was treated as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(K) given 1% Na-CMC</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(P1) given 100 mg/30 g BW of extract</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(P2) given 200 mg/30 g BW of extract</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(P3) given 300 mg/30 g BW of extract (P4) given 400 mg/30 g BW of extract (P5) given 500 mg/30 g BW of extract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The treatment was given orally (single dose) to mice using a sonde. The observation parameters in this study were the number of mortality mice after 24 hours of administration n-hexane extract bulung boni and toxicity symptoms experienced by mice for 14 days. Symptoms of toxicity observed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were hypersalivation,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">convulsions, diarrhea, behavioral changes, and tremor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Observation of hypersalivation toxicity symptoms was indicated by the continuous salivation of mice. Observation of hypersalivation toxicity symptoms in the treatment group did not show any symptoms, therefore salivation in mice in the treatment group and control group was normal. Symptoms of convulsion toxicity was indicated by uncontrolled muscle contractions on mice. In the observation of the symptoms convulsions also showed normal conditions in both the treatment and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">control groups. Symptoms of diarrhea toxicity are indicated by the condition of liquid feces and repeatedly. Observation of diarrhea in this study also showed no symptoms in the treatment groups and control group. Changes in behavior and activity of mice in the treatment groups and control group also showed normal condition. Tremor toxicity symptoms were observed on 1 mice in the 500 mg/30 g BW dose treatment group. This symptom was indicated by the trembling of the mice's</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">body at the time of rest and activity. Mice with tremor occurred in the first 20 minutes after being given the test preparation. Tremor may be caused by a disturbance in the neuromuscular system of mice after administration of n-hexane extract of bulung boni at a dose of 500 mg/30 g BW. Neuromuscular occurs due to a failure of interaction between motor nerves and muscle cells which causes muscle contraction disorders (Lu and Kacew, 2002). Mice that experience tremors then return to normal the following day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Determination of the LD</span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font3">value is based on the presence or absence of death in the test animals. The results of observations made during 14 days showed no deaths. The data that has been obtained from each group within 24 hours until day 14, then used to calculate the LD</span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font3">value using the Thomson and Weil formula. With no death of test animals, it shows that there is no f factor obtained from the Thomson and Weil table, so the calculation of the LD</span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font3">value cannot be continued. This is in accordance with the criteria for acute toxicity tests conducted to assess LD</span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font3">that based on the agreement taken by experts, if the maximum dose given does not cause the death of test animals, then the LD</span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font3">is expressed with pseudo LD</span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font3">or not the real</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">LD</span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font3">(Loomis, 1978). According to Armansyah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font3">., (2016) in the acute toxicity test that has been carried out does not cause the death of test animals after giving a single dose of test substance, so to determine the LD</span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font3">value of the extract, the highest dose given to the test animals is used. Based on this statement, the apparent LD</span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font3">value of bulung boni n-hexane extract in this study is 16.6 g/ kg BW and bulung boni n-hexane extract is included in a practically non-toxic category. If up to a dose of 5000 mg/ kg BW does not cause death, then the test does not need to be continued using a higher dose of test substance (BPOM, 2014). In general, the smaller the LD</span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font3">value the more toxic the compound, and vice versa the greater the LD</span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font3">value the lower the toxicity.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The n-hexane extract of bulung boni (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Caulerpa cylindracea</span><span class="font3">) mostly contains fatty acid derivative compounds. The most abundant compound contained in the extract is the compound </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester</span><span class="font3"> with an AUC value of 35.21%. The n-hexane extract of bulung boni (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Caulerpa cylindracea</span><span class="font3">) at a dose of 500 mg/30 g BW did not result in death in 50% of the test animals. The LD</span><span class="font1">50 </span><span class="font3">value determined was a pseudo of 16.6 g/ kg BW</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and fell into the practically non-toxic category.</span></p>
