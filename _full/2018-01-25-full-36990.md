<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Abstract</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The images of teenagers in the world, especially in South Asia and Southeast Asia have less information about reproductive and sexual health because of the assumption that it is unnecessary even considered harmful if they knew it. It’s not surprise that the teen birth rate is still quite high. previous research in Indonesia on adolescent premarital sexual behavior, obtain a yield of about 25% - 51% of teens have sex before marriage. (Utomo ID 2009; 40 (2) :. 133-46.). Studies in Bali obtain the results of teenage boys in high school (SMA) and junior high school (SMP) more premarital sex (40.3% and 29.4%) than girls (3.6% and 12.5%). Teenage boys in Bali more permissive toward premarital sexual behavior than girls and about 5% of teens have sex before marriage (Faturochman 1992; 1 :. 12-7) Adolescents have a right to a healthy life. They need to have access of the tools that can protect their health, such as condoms, contraception and youth-friendly health services are comprehensive. Governed by Law no. 36/2009 Article 4 and 5, which states that everyone has the same right to gain access of health and this rule does not see marital status. The purpose of this study was to describe the general perception of access and use of contraception among adolescents in the city of Denpasar.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Teenager is considered as the group of society that easily affected by information whether it is positive or negative. The most influenced ones are those that disseminate by mass media such as magazine, newspaper, tabloids, as well as electronic media like radio, television, and internet. As stated in various data that collected in SKRRI 2007 about the information that mostly liked by teenagers, the information delivered to teenagers should be entertaining in nature. The sexual and reproductive health problem is considerably important for teenagers since they are considered to be sexually active. The term sexual and reproduction health was first described in International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) which was held in Cairo in 1994.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In research conducted by Foumane et.al (2012) among female teenagers in Senior High School in Cameroon urban area, it was found that as teenagers get older, the more likely they had active sexual habit. This problem is clearly lead to undesirable effect in the future. The teenagers that have been introduced to sexual intercourse and drugs tend to have higher risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. In addition, undesirable pregnancy is also the consequence of active free sex behavior that mostly ignored by teenagers. Undesirable</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">pregnancy can be defined as pregnancy that occurred because of several factors so that it is not desired by the mother or family. The associated factors are inadequate knowledge about pregnancy process, rape, and failure of contraceptive or others methods of pregnancy prevention., Family planning is one part of Reproductive Health Program. The knowledge about device/method of family planning in &nbsp;Indonesian &nbsp;teenagers in the &nbsp;Teenagers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Reproductive &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survey</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(SurveiKesehatanReproduksiRemaja/SKRRI) &nbsp;2007 was</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">obtained by &nbsp;asking the &nbsp;respondent to &nbsp;mention the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">device/method of family planning that can be used by married couple to prevent pregnancy. Almost all respondents had ever been known about at least one of the modern device/method of family planning, The knowledge of family planning was little bit lower among male and female teenagers compared to married female respondent aged 15-49 years and male respondent aged 15-45 years that were interviewed in Indonesia Health and Demographic Survey (Survei Demografi dan Kesehatan Indonesia/SDKI) 2007. Injection, pils, and condom were commonly known by female and male teenagers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Indonesia, the teenager birth rate in rural areas is almost two times higher than in urban areas with 62 births per 1000 people compared to 35 per 1000 in urban areas. While the contraception has been introduced in the same time as family planning program, there are still a lot of rumors and stigma about contraception including pregnancy. Family planning includes two categories namely communication, Information, Education, and Counseling aspects and contraception device service aspect. According to SKRRI 2007, both aspects were attracting the interest of unmarried teenagers. Nevertheless, providing contraceptive devices for unmarried couple is not part of National Family Planning Program. To understand about the desire of the respondent to use family planning device/methods, they are asked whether they would use the devices/methods in the future. Through this further analysis, it also observed whether the female and male teenagers want the device/method of family planning to be available for those who are not yet married when they need it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From August 2002 until August 2003, KISARA PKBI Bali had conducted a survey about the dating attitude and behavior and sexual activity in grade 3 students of Junior High School and fist grader of Senior High School (Those who were ≤ 17 years old) in Denpasar, Badung, Tabanan, and Gianyar. It revealed that 526 (23.75%) respondent had ever been dating from 2215 respondents. However, none of them agreed about sexual intercourse before marriage. The same results were obtained in the question whether petting, anal sex, or oral sex is allowed before marriage. 44.15% respondents indeed agreed that masturbation is allowed and acceptable while other agreed that lips kiss (21.58%) and forehead/cheek kiss (55.85%) are allowed. However, when asked about the activities that they had conducted before (among those who had girl/boyfriend), 2.28% were found to had sexual intercourse and 0,57% had conducted petting, anal sex, or oral sex. 13.12% had been had lips kissing, 26.24% had forehead or cheek kissing, and 51.63% of male respondent had masturbation while only 3,32% female respondent had masturbation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The aforementioned findings indicate that today’s teenagers had high risk sexual behavior and even having unwanted pregnancy. Until June 2014, 18.237 of teenagers had HIV &amp;&nbsp;AIDS(Ditjen PPM &amp;&nbsp;PL Depkes RI). Meanwhile, until June 2014, the cumulative percentage of AIDS in 20-29 years age group was 32.9% (Kemenkes RI, 2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The most important thing that needs to be delivered together with contraception is education/knowledge. Nowadays, the knowledge of reproductive health is still considered as taboo for teenagers while the opposite phenomenon occurred in the society. The reproductive health information should not only contain sexuality and contraceptive but also</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">how to manage sexual desire and how to prevent violence and healthy relationship that would be beneficial when they married. It also includes how to select appropriate contraception methods, the promise of couple supports, and who will use the contraception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Teenagers have right to live a healthy life. They need access to devices that could protect their health such as condom, contraception, and comprehensive friendly teenager health services. As stated in government act no 36/2009 article 4 and 5, every person has the same right to access to health service and this regulations does not mentioned about marriage status. According to aforementioned problems, the authors aim to evaluate the perception about contraceptive access and utilization among teenagers in Denpasar.</span></p>
