<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Humans have their ways to express their feelings. One of the ways to express it is through language. Humans will never be able to escape from language. People utilize language to express an idea, thoughts and feeling by utilizing sounds, motions and flags for various purposes and reasons. Foley (1997:27) stated that language is usually defined as a system of signs.</span></p>

The music video and its song lyrics are closely related and are used to convey the meaning of a song and produced for promotional or artistic purposes. Kim Nam-Joon is better known by his stage name RM is a South Korean rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is one of the best songwriters with his beautiful and good lyrical meaning. In 2017 he do a collaboration song entitled &quot;Change&quot; with an American rapper named Olubuwale Victor Akintimehin better known by his stage name Wale.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The analysis related to the elements and types of the meaning of Visual and Verbal Signs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Visual Communication Elements in Visual Sign</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/73551-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:171pt;height:84pt;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fig. 1 (02.13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Kim Nam-Joon (RM) the rapper can be identified as a person who wears a black hat, white t-shirt, black ripped jeans, black long coat, and black boots shoes. He used a necklace on his neck. His facial expressions show an ironic smile. Kim Nam-Joon touches his hat very often, this can also be a sign that he wants to close his eyes from the world that is too harsh to describe. Olubuwale (Wale) as the rapper can be identified as a person who wears a white t-shirt with &quot;Wale&quot; names written on it, white ripped jeans, a black bomber jacket, and black sneakers. In other scenes, he also wears a yellow tartan shirt. He used a cross necklace on his neck and black glasses on his face. His facial expressions show an ironic smile. In one of the scenes, Wale is shown standing on the podium, indicating that he is conveying important messages and he wants to be heard by the audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Verbal Representation Elements Used in the ‘Change’ Music Video.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(RM)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Oh, tell me that dark can never win the light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the lyrics, RM refers to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dark</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">light</span><span class="font0"> to state wrong and right which can then be identified with certainty from the following line, making the use of these two words the connotative meaning of Leech (1983). As is well known, RM performed the song Change to tell a story about life and he expressed the wrong in life and the right in life using </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dark</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">light</span><span class="font0"> words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(RM)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In this crazy world, after patience, can we get the (pearl)?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">But this world which teaches, me preaches, me how to curl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is a collocative meaning in the lyrics, which can be seen from the use of an expression of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">this world which teaches, me preaches, me</span><span class="font0">. In this case, the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">teaches</span><span class="font0"> is defined as teaching to provide experiences, such as learning from the teacher. The word teach is usually used in formal teaching or the classroom and refers to education, but in this case, RM uses it as a use of the word to teach something to gain experience as a lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(RM)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Divided spaces and forever lasting stresses Everybody's mad</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kill people with fingers on twitter</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">More than a gun, more than a knife</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An affective meaning can be found in the lyrics above, which is when RM expresses </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lasting stress</span><span class="font0">es. It expresses the feelings that RM has as a singer, the feelings of listeners, and the feelings of everyone who has to live in a chaotic world. The word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stresses</span><span class="font0"> are defined as a person's emotions caused by various pressures received from life or aspects that bother the person. In addition, there is a reflected meaning in the lyrics, which is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">to kill people with fingers on twitter</span><span class="font0">. The word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">kill</span><span class="font0"> in the lyrics reflects the description of hurting people and, in one sense, does not mean killing people with the finger on social media. The word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">kill</span><span class="font0"> can contain various conceptual meanings, such as hurt, suppress, or kill, but are combined into one word that can reflect these various meanings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Wale)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When it's time to vote the people turn to mannequins</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Challenge that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wale uses a collocative meaning in the lyrics of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">people turn to mannequins</span><span class="font0"> because the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">turn</span><span class="font0">, in an actual environment, especially when referring to people, can be carried on with one's character. For example, He turns to be a good person. But in this case, Wale uses the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">turn to </span><span class="font0">as a substitute for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">change into</span><span class="font0">, so that a more suitable word be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a change into mannequins</span><span class="font0">. However, the use of turn to is used to offer a different kind of appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(RM)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Praying for better pace for you and I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I see some grass growing in winters eyes</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I think I think too much now and drink too much now</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">To numb it cause I don't wanna die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RM uses the collocative meaning in the lyrics </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">to numb it</span><span class="font0">. This can be seen from the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numb, </span><span class="font0">which can be referred to as numbness that arises due to natural reactions. Example: Numb is used to describe how a person's fingers feel numb from prolonged exposure to cold air. While in this case can be created by individuals or occurs in nature. The word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numb</span><span class="font0"> can also be included in a reflected meaning. Natural </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numb</span><span class="font0">ness, as explained, is the body's reaction to its surroundings, giving rise to a feeling of numbness. Meanwhile, in RM's lyrics, he creates the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numb</span><span class="font0"> to oppress his depressed feelings and thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Wale and RM)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I believe that real friends love you to no limit</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I believe that real change lies in the mirror</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wale and RM use a reflected meaning in the lyrics above, which is in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">real change lie in the mirror</span><span class="font0">. The word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mirror</span><span class="font0"> can be categorized as selfreflection, meaning that when someone wants to change, the change can be done by oneself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Wale and RM)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Not stopping day by day, night by night</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">It's on you and I</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Moonz and the ARMY right</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wale and RM convey social conditions literally in lyrics </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">not stopping day by day, night by night</span><span class="font0">, making this is included into a social meaning. It can be seen that day and night happen in social life and this is used as a link to the message Wale and RM want to convey as singers to song listeners.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSION</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">From the analysis of the previous chapter, it can be concluded that fifteen out of fifteen elements of visual communication are found. In the appearance category, six elements are found including age, gender, national and racial, hairstyle, body and size, and looks. In the manner category, four elements are found including expressions, eye contact, pose, and clothes. Furthermore, in the activity category, three elements are found including touch, body movement, and positional communication. Next, one element is found in props and the setting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As far as the analysis of verbal representation is concerned, one conceptual meaning, two connotative meaning, two social meaning, four affective meaning, three reflected meaning, three collocative meaning, and one thematic meaning are found. The analysis of this music video clip is based on my point of view and uses textual analysis, which means the meaning of the song is analyzed without asking the writer or the singer.</span></p>
