Palm oil fiber has its potency as feed fiber source for ruminant but contains high lignin and causes limited digestibility This research was carried out to find the effect of soaking palm oil fiber in filtrated palm oil fruit bunch ash FPOFBA on in vitro digestibility This experiment used a completely randomized design that repeated for 4times Palm oil fruit bunch ash was mixed in water and entered into container for 24 hours within concentrations consists o
