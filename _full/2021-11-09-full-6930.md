<p><span class="font1">Advertising is a form of communication for marketing and is used to encourage, persuade, or manipulate an audience (viewers, readers or listeners; sometimes a specific group) to continue or take some new action. In the current era of globalization advertising has become a very important thing. As well as news, advertisements are also used separately to convey a message or purpose. The message can be either moral or commercial messages. But unlike the news, advertising is more attractive because it is attractively packaged and also uses persuasive language. Commercial advertisers often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through &quot;branding, &quot;&nbsp;which involves associating a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. Non-commercial advertisers who spend</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">money on advertising items other than a consumer product or service include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may rely on free modes of persuasion, such as a public service announcement (PSA).

Heineken then make some creative commercial ads to attract the consumer’s attention. This beer advertisements made all that interesting and contains a hidden message. Therefore, Heineken printed advertisements were chosen for analysis because it is very interesting and creative.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The collected data were analyzed qualitatively based on the theories proposed by:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leech (1977) who classifies meaning into seven types and declares five most important communicative functions of language.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Advertisement 1</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis of Message</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font1">5.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verbal Sign</span></p></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The verbal aspect in the first advertisement is “for a Fresher World Heineken”. This phrase is the only verbal sign found in this advertisement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">5.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual Sign</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The visual aspect in this first advertisement consists of colour, shape, sign and background.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colour in the first picture is dominated with green colour, used as colour of the bottle of beer and the wall. Beside that main colour there is colours that exist in the picture, there are yellow, white, brown, and red. Yellow is the colour of the candle’s fire. White is the colour of the candle. Brown is the colour of the table and candle’s pot. Red is the colour of the back chamber.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the bottle of beer in particular, is a glass with green colour. Beside the bottle of beer, there is white candle. The candle melts and surrounds the bottle of beer.</span></p></li>
<li>

This beer can be the best friend for the people who need serenity, calmness, and relaxing time. As clearly illustrated in the first ad that has the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">atmosphere of a dark green background, but the background light beer like a candle light that illuminates when dark.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The verbal message in this ad is good enough and clearly understandable “For a Fresher World (star symbol) Heineken”.

This explains that if consumers need something to fresh their mind like forgetting their problems because of the effect from this beer, it can be the best choice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The two Heineken beer advertisements that were analysed contain visual and verbal aspects. However, the more dominant was the visual aspect rather than verbal aspects to deliver a message to the readers or customers. Both signs have meaning and function in their presentation. Connotative meaning, and conceptual meaning were used in this type of advertisement, because the signs conveyed about information, facts, instruction and persuasion. They were conveyed through message or content of the advertisement. The informational function of the ad was used by the advertiser.</span></p>
