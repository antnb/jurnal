<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BACKGROUND</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Language is a means of communication and it cannot be separated from the society. Language is one of human cultures that cannot be separated from life, as it is a part of human behavior. It is used to communicate, to interact to one another and to express one’s feelings. In literature, the language or words, which are used by the writer or poets in their works sound artistically but sometimes ambiguous, and rarely strengthen the meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Literature includes all thoughtful writing about human concerns. It deals with human experience, it treats important ideas, and its wording is often beautiful and exact. Figurative is used in particular way to explore the fake through the known. It is so accustomed to figure of speech in our everyday reading and conversation. It is the best therefore to have kinds of figurative language in mind, add their names to our critical vocabulary. This study was focused on analyzing figurative language that is used in poems, because it is one of the interesting things that by knowing the figure of speech in the poems and explores the deepest meaning in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PROBLEM OF THE STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Based on the background as stated above, the problems of research can be formulated as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>METHOD</span></h2>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Research Method</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">In doing a scientific research, research method is very important. The method is a procedure to be applied in a research in accordance with the approach used. The success or failure of the analysis depends on how relevant the method being used in the writing. The methodology that is used in doing this research includes the determination of data source, data collection and data analysis as further described below.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Data Source</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">The data were taken from the poems “Ah, Are You Digging On My Grave” and “The Man He Killed” written by Thomas Hardy. These poems were chosen as the data source because the construction of these poems contains many figurative languages.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Method and Technique of Collecting Data</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">The method and technique of collecting the data consist of two phases. This method was conducted by reading the selected literary works, especially those about poem in order to get enough information about the relevant data for the topic. The data were collected through selecting the poem, which contains many figurative language. The data also needed to be read thoroughly after being collected, and this was continued by reading the poem itself and taking necessary notes while classifying the data based on the types of figurative language in order to get appropriate information related to the topic. In addition, the collection of some other information about the poet from his biography could help better understanding of the poem, especially that having to do the figurative language.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Method and Technique of analyzing Data</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">The data was presented descriptively and analyzed based on the theories of figurative language proposed by Knickerbocker and Reninger (1963) and theory of meaning by Leech (1974). In analyzing the data of the poems, the semantic theory written by Geoffrey Leech was used. Based on the theory mentioned in the theoretical framework, the main concern of this paper is to find out the whole meaning of the poems through line by line analysis in order to discover the meanings of the figurative language that used in the poems.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>ANALYSIS AND RESULT</span></h2>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Poem “</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ah Are You Digging On My Grave</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Stanza 1</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Ah, are you digging on my grave,</span><span class="font1"> (1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">My loved one? — </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">planting rue?&quot;</span><span class="font1"> (2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">— &quot;No: yesterday he went to wed</span><span class="font1"> (3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">One of the brightest wealth has bred.</span><span class="font1"> (4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">'It cannot hurt her now,' he said,</span><span class="font1"> (5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">'That I should not be true.'&quot;</span><span class="font1"> (6)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irony</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In line 2, “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">My loved one? — </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">planting rue?&quot;”,</span><span class="font1"> this sentence is using figure of speech of irony to describe an expression of sorrow felt by one who lost the dead person. Rue is actually a kind of shrub which is widely known as symbol of sorrow. Planting rue over someone’s grave means we mourned the loss of someone we know quite well or perhaps the one we loved. Initially, the woman seems to feel that her death has caused sorrow for the loved one and that she remains strong in his memory.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synecdoche</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In line 4</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">,” One of the brightest wealth has bred”,</span><span class="font1"> the poet is using an expression of synecdoche. In real context, there is no way wealth able to breed. The use of word ‘bred’ here is actually describing the man which is woman’s presumably former husband’s wealth has increased. This was indicated by the use of the third-person “he” to refer to the man. The voice explains that the woman’s loved one—perhaps a husband or lover—has married another woman.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Then who is digging on my grave,</span><span class="font1"> (1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">My nearest dearest kin?&quot;</span><span class="font1"> (2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">— &quot;Ah, no: they sit and think, 'What use!</span><span class="font1"> (3)</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperbole</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In line 2, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">My nearest dearest kin?&quot;,</span><span class="font1"> the poet using the expression of hyperbole in order to strengthen the meaning of the sentence. The word ‘kin’ itself means family or someone who we know or friend. the word ‘nearest’ is superlative of `near' or `close' which means within the shortest distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In line 4, “</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What good will planting flowers produce</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">”,</span><span class="font0"> this sentence is using figure of speech of hyperbole which is describing that what benefit for grieving upon her is. The poet giving some kind exaggeration that flower will something else that its bloom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In line 5 and 6, “</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">No tendance of her mound can loose </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">— </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Her spirit from Death's gin</span><span class="font1">”, the poet using the of figure of speech of hyperbole, this sentence is explaining of no matter what kind of actions will not prevent her from. This sentence is also strengthen by previous line, “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">What good will planting flowers produce?”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Stanza 3</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;But someone digs upon my grave?(1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">My enemy? — </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">prodding sly?</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot; (2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">— &quot;Nay: when she heard you had passed the Gate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(3)</span></p>

The ‘prodding’ itself means to squat down or lean lower. From here, we can imagine that the ‘rival’ comes to her as sign of a ‘mockery’ of her death.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">b. Personification</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In line 3 and 4, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Nay: when she heard you had passed the Gate — That shuts on all flesh soon or late,”</span><span class="font1"> the poet using figure of speech of personification. The poet uses the word “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the Gate</span><span class="font1">” because he wants to give human sensibilities and human characteristics to the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Gate</span><span class="font1">”, so this word as if acts like life-like being. the gate described as if its moving on its own and could swallow and devour all flesh ( note; human).</span></p>
