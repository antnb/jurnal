<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Bali Island is an island known as the Island of the Gods or the Island of a Thousand Temples. The existence of temples in Bali is an attraction for tourists worldwide, thanks to its uniqueness and beauty. [1] One of the potential and development of Bali Island is in the tourism industry, one of which is the Tanah Lot Temple Tourism Object, which is located in Beraban Village, Kediri District, Tabanan Regency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tanah Lot Temple offers uniqueness and beauty for tourists, including the temple building built on a boulder in the middle of the sea. The beauty of the sunset adds to the attraction of tourists visiting Tanah Lot Temple. Many tourists visit Tanah Lot Temple Tourism Object to see the uniqueness or want to take pictures in front of the building. Still, many of these tourists also do not know information about the building's name, layout, and function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on these problems, a technology-based information and communication media is needed that is able to explain and provide information about building information and building layout in Tanah Lot Temple to domestic and foreign tourists with a complete and attractive</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">presentation of information. AR (Augmented Reality) is currently experiencing rapid development, where Augmented Reality technology has touched various areas of life, especially in advertising, education, and tourism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Research on the application of Augmented Reality in various fields has been carried out, one of which is the research by Adi Ferliyanto Waruwu in 2014. This research discusses AR technology as a medium for providing information about Temple in Bali. DewataAR uses Android as a platform and is designed using the Vuforia SDK to produce applications that can display 3D objects, the information in audio and video. [2]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another research is a study by I Ketut Gede Darma Putra in 2019, which discusses Augmented Reality in the field of education. This research uses books as markers. The final result of this research is the augmented reality application that displays 3D objects and the appropriate music so that reading Lubdaka folklore is more enjoyable. [3]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Augmented Reality application in the introduction of objects in the form of buildings has been carried out in research by Anak Agung Ngurah Hary Susila and Dewa Made Sri Arsa in 2019. The research discusses augmented reality technology as building introduction media in Penglipuran Traditional Village, in this study using the Vuforia library and brochures as markers. The final result of this research is designing an augmented reality application that can provide information about the traditional buildings of Penglipuran Village in the form of 3D animation, text, and audio narratives. [4]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Augmented Reality's application and implementation in this study touch the field of tourism and education on promoting and presenting Tanah Lot Temple to tourists in an attractive form using a smartphone or tablet. This research is designed to use the Wikitude library on Android smartphone devices and web hosting to store application data so that the system in this study is dynamic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Augmented Reality application with real object markers of Tanah Lot Temple produces output in the form of 2D objects of building information and location points and is clarified with audio explanations of each building's details. The use of the method of presenting information with Augmented Reality technology is expected to be more attractive to tourists and facilitate and pamper tourists in knowing building information at Tanah Lot Temple by giving more attractive information.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The method used in application design uses the waterfall method, where the stages are carried out in four stages, namely the stages of analysis, design, implementation, and testing. Research data collection is the initial stage carried out. Sources of research data are obtained from scientific journals, books, ebooks, official websites, and published papers downloaded via the internet. The method used in this study is the Markerless Method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The markerless method is a method in augmented reality, wherein this method users no longer need to use a marker to display digital elements. Even though it is called markerless, the application is run by scanning objects or markers, but the scanned scope is more comprehensive than conventional augmented reality markers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the design stage, a design is carried out to describe an overview of the system, use case diagrams, design the application display design, and website display design. In the coding stage, the application is made using JavaScript, Java, HTML, and PHP. The programming languages Javascript, Java, HTML, and PHP, were chosen because they are compatible with the Android Studio and Wikitude programs for developing Augmented Reality Applications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the testing phase, detection testing was carried out using several smartphone devices with different light intensity conditions to determine the application's success rate in identifying and displaying object information with different device specifications and conditions.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System Overview</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The system overview displays the interaction process that occurs between the device and the user. With an overview of the system, it is expected that users can easily understand using the system and applications. An overview of the Augmented Reality application system with the real object marker of Tanah Lot Temple is shown in Figure 1.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/67541-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:360pt;height:249pt;">
<p><span class="font1">Figure 1. System Overview</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 1 is an overview of the system starting from the preparation, manufacture, and use of the augmented reality application with real object markers of Tanah Lot Temple. There are two entities in the system overview: Admin and User. Admin has a function to process and manage data to be inputted into the application. The first stage begins with the admin searching for information data and taking photos of buildings from various sides that will be used as target objects, then the admin can upload the building images to the Wikitude studio, at the Wikitude studio the building drawings are processed into target objects in the form of wto files.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The wto file that is obtained can be uploaded on the website to proceed to the next process. In the next process, the admin inputs data in the form of text, information on the target object and location data on the website. The data will be stored on the database server and encoded into JSON. JSON data and WTO file name is sent to the application to make it easier for the application to scan data and display information to the user.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The system overview also shows the interactions that occur between the user and the application. Users can interact directly with an Android smartphone equipped with an Augmented Reality application with a real object marker for Tanah Lot Temple, supported by the Wikitude library. First-time users can activate the cellular data network and GPS for easy operation of the app. Users can select features available in the application, such as real object features, point of interest features, and AR request features.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The output obtained by users is different for each feature. Real object features allow users to directly interact with the application by pointing the Android smartphone towards the target object. The output displayed is information in the form of narrative text accompanied by an explanation of the target object's sound. Another result obtained by the user is that the application can display location points around the area if users select the point of interest feature. Users can request a specific location to be displayed on the application by selecting the request ar feature. With the various features contained in the application, it is hoped that it can make it easier for users to find out the information contained in the Tanah Lot Temple Tourism Object.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augmented Reality</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Augmented Reality (AR) is one of the innovations that arise from technological developments. Augmented Reality is a technology that can make two-dimensional and threedimensional objects appear to be in the real world and interact with humans. Augmented reality technology helps simplify real objects by carrying virtual objects so that all users can receive that information.[7] Augmented Reality has two methods for identifying markers, namely markerbased tracking and markerless. Marker-based tracking is a technique that gives commands to a computer to track markers that have been created and placed in their proper positions. The markerless method is different from marker-based tracking, which does not require a marker to trigger the object's appearance. Research that applies the markerless approach in his study is found in a study conducted by I Wayan Andis Indrawan in 2017. [8]</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Wikitude is a software development kit that can build, maintain, and monitor Augmented Reality environments. Wikitude in 2008 included image recognition, 3D model rendering, location-based AR, and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) technology that allows object recognition and object tracking without the need for markers. The Wikitude SDK features the Wikitude Studio, a website-based studio designed to produce and manage the Wikitude Image Collection (wtc) and Wikitude Object Collection (wto) and create and publish augmented reality experiences. Wikitude uses commonly used programming languages, such as</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. Wikitude first released the Software Development Kit (SDK) in 2008. Wikitude SDK can run on Android and IOS operating systems.[9]</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>3.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Android</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Android is an operating system that runs on smartphones. Android provides an open platform (open source) for application developers to create various kinds of applications. The origin of Android occurred when Google Inc. bought shares of Android Inc., a newcomer who made software (software) for mobile phones. Then Android developed and formed the Open Handset Alliance, a combination of 344 hardware, software, and telecommunications companies including Google HTC, Intel, Motorola, Qualcomm, TMobile, and Nvidia.

<p><span class="font1">Figure 14. Test Results on Vivo with Afternoon conditions</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Figure 13 shows the results of the Redmi device with afternoon conditions that can still detect and display target object information completely and correctly with a distance of 10 meters and with a time of 15 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 14 shows the results of Vivo devices with afternoon conditions that can still detect and display target object information completely and correctly with a distance of 8 meters and with a time of 12 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Table 1 is the test result of each device in the daytime and afternoon conditions. The application testing process is carried out to determine the Wikitude system's accuracy and each device's system. The test results with daytime conditions on each device show very good results and fast detection time. This is because there is sufficient light in daytime conditions so that the target object detection process carried out by each device runs very well. Meanwhile, the testing process in the afternoon conditions showed quite good results. Testing with conditions in the afternoon, each device can still display information but a closer distance and longer time in the detection process. This is due to the minimal lighting obtained by the camera of each device for detection. Other factors that can affect the device in detecting the target object and displaying the location points are the shooting factor and each device's signal strength factor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Application assessment is carried out by distributing a questionnaire of 25 sheets. There are six questions in the survey, each of which has grades 1-4 with information from less useful / less easy to very good / very easy. The results of the survey are illustrated with a diagram, which can be seen in Figure 15.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the tests that have been carried out, the results are in the form of conclusions from Augmented Reality Design research with the real object markers of Tanah Lot Temple. This study was designed using the Wikitude library on Android smartphone devices and web hosting to store application data. The Augmented Reality application with Tanah Lot Temple real object markers can be dynamically functioned, making it easier to add information without modifying the application program code. Overall the application runs well on Android devices and can recognize target objects and display data in various conditions. Application appraisal is done by distributing questionnaires containing six questions aimed at 25 respondents. The results of the assessment based on the questionnaire analysis carried out get a percentage value of 60% at level 3.</span></p>
