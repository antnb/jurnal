  - "friction pressure 15 kg/cm2 andthresure 70 kg/cm3 can be concluded that frinction time that is recomended is 35 second.Friction weldingmethod can be applied for the joining low carbon steel pipe. The microstructure in the joining was found notsignificant change that mean there is no change in mechanical properties"
