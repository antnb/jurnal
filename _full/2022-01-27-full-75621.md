<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ABSTRACT</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">This study aims to analyze the effect of liquidity, managerial ownership and use of derivatives on corporate risk of manufacturing companies on the Indonesia Stock Exchange IDX.. This research was conducted using a quantitative approach. The population in this study are all manufacturing companies listed on the IDX. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling method. The companies included in the sample of this study are manufacturing companies that use derivative instruments and are always listed on the IDX from 2016 to 2018. A total of 12 companies can be used as final samples in this study. Based on the results of regression analysis and mediation test, it can be concluded that the managerial ownership variable has a significant positive effect on the Usage of Derivative Instruments. The variable Usage of Derivative Instruments has a significant negative effect on company risk. The Usage of Derivative Instruments is able to mediate the relationship between managerial ownership and corporate risk.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The companies have a very important role for the economy of a country. The companies are also the main factor that determines the movement of the business world. In 2019, a total of 606 companies were listed on the Indonesian capital market, namely the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). Of all the companies listed on the IDX, 28% are manufacturing companies. But now, the main challenge for the company is how the company is able to face the increasing risk. Globalization, liberalization and technological advances cause companies to have various kinds of risks that must be faced such as exchange rate risk, risk of changes in interest rates, market risk, credit risk, operational risk, technology risk,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">credit risk, liquidation risk, risk of changes in commodity prices, risk of global financial crisis and others (Saunders &amp;&nbsp;Cornett, 2014). These risks are difficult to avoid, can occur at any time and at worst can result in bankruptcy for the company. The volatility of the company's stock returns can be used to measure all risks faced by the company (Bartram et al.</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font10"> 2009). Research on how to deal with corporate risk is very important to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Based on previous research, liquidity, managerial ownership and usage of derivative instruments are important factors that can affect company risk </span><span class="font4">(</span><span class="font10">Biase &amp;&nbsp;Apolito, 2012; Capozza &amp;&nbsp;Seguin, 2003; Gatopoulos &amp;&nbsp;Louberge, 2013). Liquidity is a financial ratio that reflects the company's ability to meet its short-term needs by using the company's current assets. The higher the liquidity of a company, the lower the risk because the company has ability to meet its short-term needs (Biase &amp;&nbsp;Apolito, 2012). Managerial ownership is the number of shares owned by management from all share capital in the company. Managerial ownership has important role to invest in assets that have lower risk and decide to use lower proportion of debt, thus the total risk of the company tends to decrease (Capozza &amp;&nbsp;Seguin, 2003). Derivative instruments are a tool for companies and other users to reduce company risk (Gatopoulos &amp;&nbsp;Louberge, 2013). When a company reduces its risk exposure by using derivatives, this is referred to as hedging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Besides, liquidity and managerial ownership also can influence the usage of derivatives by the company as a hedging instrument (Lantara, 2010; Biase &amp;&nbsp;Apolito, 2012; Tufano, 1996). When the companies have problem with their liquidity, they tend to use derivatives instrument to overcome this probrem (Lantara, 2010). The companies with a lager proportion of managerial ownership tend to have a greater motivation to use derivatives as risk management tools (Tufano, 1996). Therefore, it could be observed that the usage of derivative instrument could have a mediation role. This study aims to analyze the effect of liquidity and managerial ownership on the Usage of Derivative Instruments and corporate risk in manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). In-depth research on the influence of liquidity and managerial ownership on the Usage of Derivative Instruments and corporate risk is still very much needed in Indonesia. The implementation of this research is expected to help companies in Indonesia in tackling corporate risks, so that companies are able to survive and contribute to the Indonesian economy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Risk can be defined as an adverse event (Hanafi, 2014). The types of risks faced by the company are physical asset risk, employee risk, legal risk, interest rate risk, currency exchange risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and country risk. Meanwhile, according to Horne &amp;&nbsp;Warchowicz (2008) company risk is categorized into three types of risk: business risk, financial risk and total risk. Aggregate company risk can be measured by calculating the volatility of the company's stock returns (Guay, 1999). Thus, the risk of the company referred to in this study is the volatility of daily stock returns for one year in manufacturing companies on the IDX for the 2016-2018 period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Liquidity reflects the company's ability to meet its short-term needs by using the current assets of the company Horne &amp;&nbsp;Warchowicz (2008). The level of liquidity in a company also affects the company's ability to take available investment opportunities. If the company is unable to take the investment opportunity due to short-term liquidity constraints, then the company tends to use derivative instruments by means of hedging to overcome this problem (Froot, 1993). Research by Carter &amp;&nbsp;Sinkey (1998) concludes that liquidity problems in a company are closely related to the need to use derivatives as hedging instruments. Research by Lantara (2010) proves that the company's liquidity is very influential on the Usage of Derivative Instruments negatively and significantly. The company's liquidity level can be measured by calculating the company's Current Ratio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hypothesis 1: Liquidity has a negative and significant effect on the Usage of Derivative Instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ownership structure is an important factor of corporate governance that can affect the use of derivatives. In his research, Lantara (2010) stated that companies that have a greater proportion of shares held by managerial, then company leaders have a greater motivation to use derivative instruments in order to reduce risk and increase company value. This is because the management of the company is part of the shareholders so that it has the same goal as other shareholders, namely to increase company value. Research by Tufano (1996) found empirical evidence that managers who have larger shareholdings tend to use derivatives as a hedging tool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hypothesis 2: Managerial Ownership has a positive and significant effect on the Usage of Derivative Instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The level of liquidity measures the company's ability to meet its short-term needs by using the company's current assets. Low corporate liquidity indicates the company's inability to meet its short-term needs Horne &amp;&nbsp;Warchowicz (2008). It can be observed that the low level of liquidity of a company indicates the company's financial performance is not good. When the company has a high level of liquidity, this shows that the company does not have financial problems, so the company's risk decreases. Research by Beaver et al.</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font10"> (1970) examined the effect of market factors and accounting factors on the company's systematic risk and found a negative significant correlation between the level of liquidity and the company's systematic risk. In addition, empirical research by Biase &amp;&nbsp;Apolito (2012) concluded that the level of liquidity has a negative and significant effect on the risk of bank companies in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hypothesis 3: Liquidity has a negative and significant effect on company risk</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Managerial ownership in the company is believed to improve company performance because with managerial ownership the company's leaders (board of directors and board of commissioners) will be encouraged to carry out their duties properly and conduct supervision efficiently </span><span class="font4">(</span><span class="font10">Brickley et al.</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font10"> 1988). When the company has managerial ownership, the board of directors and commissioners are also part of the shareholders, so they have the same goal as other shareholders, namely increasing company value and reducing risk. Jensen &amp;&nbsp;Murphy (1990); Chung &amp;&nbsp;Pruitt (1994) concluded that board's ownership can improve company performance. In addition, research by Chen et al.</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font10"> (1998) found evidence that managerial ownership can reduce market risk. Furthermore, Capozza &amp;&nbsp;Seguin (2003) stated that companies that have a higher proportion of insider ownership tend to invest in assets that are not risky and use a lower proportion of debt in their capital structure, so that the total risk of the company tends to decrease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hypothesis 4: Managerial ownership has a negative and significant effect on company risk</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Modigliani &amp;&nbsp;Miller (1963), developing the classical theory of funding decisions, revealed that corporate risk management is irrelevant because shareholders are able to create a well-diversified stock portfolio under the assumption of a perfect capital market. However, this does not happen because in the real world there is no perfect capital market. Smith &amp;&nbsp;Stulz (1985) developed a theory of corporate hedging which states that imperfect capital markets create a condition that hedging is economically justified. Research by (Guay, 1999) found that companies that use derivatives for hedging, experience a significant reduction in corporate risk. There are several types of derivatives that the company could use for example interest rates, foreign exchange and commodities derivatives. Each types of these derivatives could be employed to manage each types of risk for example interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and investment risk. This study tried to capture the total amount and all types </span><span class="font4">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">of derivatives used by the company. The use of derivatives by means of hedging is able to reduce company risk by reducing expectations of financial distress costs and reducing tax costs (Gatopoulos &amp;&nbsp;Louberge, 2013). Therefore, it is clear that the use of derivatives is very beneficial for the company to reduce cost, maintain and maximize the firm value which is shown by the company stock price, and by then the company risk could decrease (Guay,1999). The company risk is measured by the total risk which is calculated by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock returns over years (Guay, 1999).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hypothesis 5: The Usage of Derivative Instruments has a negative and significant effect on company risk</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As previously explained, liquidity is suspected to have a negative influence on Company Risk. Company liquidity can be used as a measure to assess the company's financial performance. Good financial performance, as measured by the liquidity ratio indicates that the company has a good health condition, so that the risk of the company also tends to decrease (Chun &amp;&nbsp;Ramasamy, 1999; Hardwick &amp;&nbsp;Adams, 1999; Biase &amp;&nbsp;D'Apolito, 2012).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Liquidity is also suspected to have a negative effect on the Usage of Derivative Instruments. In the course of its business, the company, of course, has experienced financial difficulties or problems. The company's liquidity can be a reference or an assessment of whether the company has financial problems. Poor financial performance, which is reflected in the level of liquidity ratios, indicates that the company is facing various financial problems such as short-term liquidity, financial distress, cash shortfalls (Froot et al., 1993; Bartram et al., 2009). This financial problem can be solved by using derivative instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Usage of Derivative Instruments is suspected to have a negative effect on the Company's Risk. The purpose of using derivative instruments is as a tool to manage company risk through hedging techniques (McDonald, 2006). Companies that are able to manage their risk by using derivative instruments through hedging have a tendency to decrease the risk faced by the company (Guay, 1999).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Based on the elaboration of several empirical studies, it can be concluded that the Usage of Derivative Instruments has a mediating role in this study. Liquidity variables affect the use of derivative products (Froot et al., 1993; Bartram et al., 2009). Liquidity variables affect firm risk (Hardwick &amp;&nbsp;Adams, 1999; Biase &amp;&nbsp;D'Apolito, 2012). Variable Usage of Derivative Instruments affects the company's risk (Guay, 1999). Some of these studies can build a new concept where the Usage of Derivative Instruments has a mediating role between liquidity and company risk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hypothesis 6: The Usage of Derivative Instruments is able to mediate the relationship between liquidity and company risk</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Managerial ownership is one of the indicators in corporate governance that affects the success of a company. Poor corporate governance, one of which is reflected in the level of managerial ownership, can result in various problems such as financial pressure, possible bankruptcy and agency conflicts (Elloumi &amp;&nbsp;Gueyie, 2001; Daily et al., 2003). This causes the Company's risk to tend to increase (Bukley et al., 2007; Salhi &amp;&nbsp;Boujelbene, 2012). Previous research also explains that managerial ownership is related to the Usage of Derivative Instruments. As the number of managerial ownership in a company increases, the company has a better ability to make all decisions that are best for the company, one of which is the decision to use derivative products (Borokhovich et al., 2004). This is because the company's managerial acts as a shareholder so that it has the same goal as other shareholders, namely to maximize the value of the company. Therefore, managerial ownership is suspected to have a positive effect on the Usage of Derivative Instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Empirical research has revealed that the Usage of Derivative Instruments can reduce corporate risk (Guay, 1999; Zhang, 2009). Derivative instruments have a function as a company risk management tool through hedging techniques (McDonald, 2006). Companies that hedge with derivative instruments aim to reduce risk (Hull, 2009). Based on the elaboration of several empirical studies, it can be concluded that the Usage of Derivative Instruments has a mediating role in this study. Managerial ownership variables affect the use of derivative products (Borokhovich et al., 2004; Osuoha, 2013). Managerial Ownership variable affects company risk (Bukley et. al.</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font10"> 2007; Salhi &amp;&nbsp;Boujelbene, 2012). Variable Usage of Derivative Instruments affects the company's risk (Guay, 1999). Some of these studies can build a new concept where the Usage of Derivative Instruments has a mediating role between managerial ownership and company risk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hypothesis 7: The Usage of Derivative Instruments is able to mediate the relationship between managerial ownership and company risk</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The study uses a causality design to prove the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. This study was designed to determine the effect of liquidity and managerial ownership on the Usage of Derivative Instruments and company risk. The object of research is the company's risk in manufacturing industrial companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2016-2018. The Usage of Derivative Instruments and company risk are the dependent variables in this study. Liquidity and managerial ownership are independent variables in this study. The research design in this study can be seen in Figure 1.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/75621-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:361pt;height:162pt;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Figure 1. Research Design</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This research was carried out in Indonesia, namely on manufacturing industrial companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) for the period 2016 to 2018. This location was chosen because the Indonesia Stock Exchange is the only stock exchange in Indonesia and all companies listed in Indonesia through Indonesia stock exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All data in this study are quantitative data. Quantitative data is data in the form of numbers. Secondary data is data that has been collected by certain parties for other purposes (Saunders et al., 2016). This study uses secondary data, where all data such as liquidity, managerial ownership, Usage of Derivative Instruments and company risk can be obtained from the annual financial statements of each company published on the Indonesia Stock</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Exchange website and for company risk data can be obtained by collecting stock price data. company through the yahoo finance website.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The population in this study are manufacturing companies on the Indonesia Stock Exchange listed from 2016 until 2018, in total there are 136 companies. The sampling technique in this study is the purposive sampling method. Purposive sampling method is a sampling technique based on criteria determined by the researcher. The sampling criteria used in this study are manufacturing companies that use derivative instruments that are always listed on the IDX for the period 2016 to 2018. There are 12 manufacturing companies that meet the sample criteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The following is the definition of all variables used in this study: Liquidity (CR) is a financial performance that shows the company's ability to meet its short-term needs. The company's liquidity in this study is measured using the current ratio, which is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities in manufacturing companies on the IDX in 2016 - 2018. The scale of this data is a ratio and the unit is percent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Managerial Ownership (MO) is the proportion of the number of shares owned by the board of directors and commissioners in the company compared to the total number of shares of the company. This proportion is measured by dividing the number of shares owned by the board of directors and commissioners by the total number of shares in manufacturing companies on the IDX in 2016 - 2018. The scale of this data is ratio data and the unit is percentage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Usage of Derivative Instruments (DERIV) is the value of derivative instruments used by companies or the amount of funds issued in the Usage of Derivative Instruments as risk management tools by manufacturing companies on the IDX in 2016 - 2018. The value of derivatives used by the companies cover all types of derivatives used. The total value of derivatives used by companies in this study was obtained from the annual reports of the sample companies, by adding up the fair value of the derivatives displayed in the financial statements, namely the company's balance sheet. This variable is measured by calculating the natural logarithm of the company's total value of derivatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Usage of Derivative Instruments = </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ln (total value of derivatives)</span><span class="font10"> .......................... (2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Corporate Risk (RISK) used in this study is the daily stock returns volatility in manufacturing companies on the IDX in 2016 - 2018. This measurement refers to previous research by Guay (1999); Bartram et al.</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font10"> (2008) which says that the measurement of risk in the aggregate can be measured using the volatility of stock returns</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The first data analysis conducted in this study was descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is a data analysis method used to describe or describe the data that has been collected (Sugiyono, 2017). Descriptive statistics in this study will calculate the average, standard deviation, percentage of sample data for all variables with ratio data such as liquidity, profitability ratios, managerial ownership, Usage of Derivative Instruments, and company risk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The second data analysis conducted in this study is inferential analysis. Inferential analysis is used to test the hypotheses formulated in this study. The inferential analysis technique used in this study is multiple linear regression analysis to test the hypothesis using</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the SPSS program. Multiple linear regression analysis technique can be used to test how the influence of the independent variables on the dependent variable in the empirical research model. Multiple linear regression equation model is the most appropriate regression model to analyze the empirical model of this study, because in the empirical model there are 2 independent variables and 2 dependent variables. Furthermore, this study uses the method of path analysis (path analysis). Path analysis is used to determine whether the independent variable has a direct or indirect effect on the dependent variable. To determine the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable used regression analysis. The multiple linear regression equation from the empirical model of this study can be written in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">following equation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">DERIV = b</span><span class="font6">11</span><span class="font10">CR + b</span><span class="font6">12</span><span class="font10">MO +</span><span class="font11">ε</span><span class="font10">1 ..........................................................................(4)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Equation 1 model is used to explain the effect of CR and MO, on the DERIV. Equation 2 model is used to explain the effect of CR, MO and DERIV on RISK.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Path analysis for mediation testing can be observed with the following explanations: 1). If X is significant to Y1 and the hypothesis is accepted, and Y1 is significant to Y2 and the hypothesis is accepted, and X is significant to Y1 and the hypothesis is accepted, then the Y1 variable is a half-mediation variable. 2). If X is significant to Y1 and the hypothesis is accepted, and Y1 is significant to Y2 and the hypothesis is accepted, while X is not significant to Y2, then Y1 is a full mediating variable. 3).

<p><span class="font10">The results of the VIF test resulted in the VIF value for all independent variables less than 10, so that all independent variables were free from the problem of multicollinearity. The results of the multicollinearity test in Table 3 presents the VIF value for each independent variable less than 10 (VIF &lt;&nbsp;10), so it can be concluded that all independent variables included in the regression model are free from multicollinearity problems. The results of the heteroscedasticity test as presented in Table 3 show that all independent variables included in the regression model are not statistically significant (sig = &gt;&nbsp;0.05) have an effect on the residuals, so the regression model is free from heteroscedasticity problems. Testing for the presence or absence of autocorrelation symptoms in the regression model was carried out using the Durbin-Watson test. The values of dL, dU, 4-dU, and 4-dL samples are 36 with = 0.05 are 1.3537 (dL), 1.5872 (dU), 2.4128 (4-dU), and 2.6463 (4-dL). So, if the Durbin-Watson value lies between dU to 4-dU or 1.5872 to 2.4128 the regression model is free from autocorrelation symptoms.

<p><span class="font10">Regression testing is done by using multiple regression and using the SPSS program. A summary of the results of the regression testing on the equation 1 model can be seen in Table 8. Based on Table 8, the regression equation can be written as follows: DERIV = 0.062CR + 0.557MO. The Liquidity Ratio (CR) coefficient value of 0.062 (positive) means that the liquidity ratio has a positive effect on the Usage of Derivative Instruments (DERIV). The coefficient of managerial ownership (MO) is 0.557 (positive), meaning that managerial ownership has a positive effect on the Usage of Derivative Instruments (DERIV). Managerial ownership has a statistically significant positive effect on the Usage of Derivative Instruments at the level of significant 1%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The magnitude of the R-square 0.27 and the F-count 7.466 with a sig-F value = 0.002 indicates that the ability of the independent variables included in the model is able to explain 31.2 percent at the level of significant 1%, while 68.8 percent is explained by other variables outside the model. This means that the Usage of Derivative Instruments is influenced by the Liquidity Ratio (CR) and Managerial Ownership (MO) of 31.2 percent, while the remaining 68.8 percent is caused by other external factors, such as: company characteristics, economic conditions, culture and others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Regression testing was carried out with multiple regression and the SPSS 21 program was used. A summary of the results of regression testing on the equation 2 model can be seen in Table 9. Based on Table 9, the regression equation can be written as follows: RISK = -0.035CR - 0.117MO - 0.416DERIV . The Liquidity Ratio (CR) coefficient value of -0.035 (negative) means that the liquidity ratio has a negative effect on Company Risk (RISK). The coefficient of managerial ownership (MO) is -0.117 (negative), meaning that managerial ownership has a negative effect on Company Risk (RISK). The coefficient value of the Usage of Derivative Instruments (DERIV) is -0.416, meaning that the Usage of Derivative Instruments has a negative effect on Company Risk (RISK). The Usage of Derivative Instruments has a statistically significant negative effect on the use of company risk at the level of significant 5%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The magnitude of the R-square 0.126 and the F-count 2.533 with a sig-F value = 0.025 indicates that the ability of the independent variables included in the model is able to explain 12.6 percent at the 1% level of significance, while 87.4 percent is explained by other variables outside the model. This means that the Usage of Derivative Instruments is influenced by the Liquidity Ratio (CR), Managerial Ownership (MO) and the Usage of Derivative Instruments (DERIV) by 12.6 percent, while the remaining 87.4 percent is caused by other external factors, such as: company characteristics, economic conditions, culture and others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Table 10 is a summary of the calculation results of the path analysis of the empirical model that can be tested with the hypotheses that have been made. As for testing the existing hypothesis, it can be seen from the Liquidity variable that it does not have a significant effect on the Derivative Instruments variable. So, Hypothesis 1 which states that liquidity has a negative and significant effect on the Usage of Derivative Instruments is rejected (H1 is rejected). Managerial Ownership has a significant direct influence on Derivative Instruments. It can be concluded that Hypothesis 2 which states that Managerial Ownership has a positive and significant effect on the Usage of Derivative Instruments is accepted (H2 is accepted).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Liquidity variable does not have a significant effect on company risk. So, Hypothesis 3 which states that Liquidity has a negative and significant effect on Company Risk is rejected</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(H3 is rejected). The relationship between Managerial Ownership and Company Risk was found to have no significant effect. It can be seen that Hypothesis 4 which states that Managerial Ownership has a negative and significant effect on Company Risk is rejected (H4 is rejected). There is a significant direct effect between the Usage of Derivative Instruments on corporate risk. Hypothesis 5 which states that the Usage of Derivative Instruments has a negative and significant effect on company risk is acceptable (H5 is accepted).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An insignificant relationship occurs in the liquidity variable to the derivative instrument variable and also the company risk variable. The results of the calculation analysis show that the indirect effect (liquidity on company risk through the Usage of Derivative Instruments) is smaller than the direct effect (liquidity on company risk). Then it can be seen that Hypothesis 6 which states that the Usage of Derivative Instruments is able to mediate the relationship between liquidity and company risk is rejected (H6 is rejected). The direct influence of the managerial ownership variable on the company's risk is not significant, but if it is through the Usage of Derivative Instruments, the result of the indirect effect is greater. So, Hypothesis 7 which states that the Usage of Derivative Instruments is able to mediate the relationship between managerial ownership and company risk is acceptable (H7 is accepted). Judging from this, there are three accepted hypotheses, namely the second hypothesis, the fifth hypothesis, and the seventh hypothesis. While there are four rejected hypotheses, namely the first hypothesis, the third hypothesis, the fourth hypothesis, and the sixth hypothesis. The results of this study can provide input to the company's management that managerial ownership plays an important role in the company's decision to use derivatives in an effort to reduce the company risk. This research also support the theory of corporate hedging by Smith &amp;&nbsp;Stulz (1985) that hedging is economically justified by finding the important role of derivatives usage in reducing the company risk.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font10">The results of the suitability test and the strength of the model in this study indicate that the regression model used is very good because it is proven to fit the data. Based on the results of the regression analysis and mediation test, it can be concluded that the managerial ownership variable has a significant positive effect on the Usage of Derivative Instruments. The variable Usage of Derivative Instruments has a significant negative effect on company risk. The Usage of Derivative Instruments can mediate the relationship between managerial ownership and company risk. The company must pay attention to the role of managerial ownership and usage of derivatives instrument in reducing company risk. The limitation of this research is in the period of the study which is limited for 3 years. The longer study period may provide a better insight. The future research may include the other factors into the analysis such as company characteristics, economic conditions and culture.</span></p>
