<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">This research is aimed at investigating the Rhetorical Structures used by the authors in the introduction section of research articles published by two different journals, namely Journal of Pragmatics and Journal of English for Academic Purposes. This research examined whether introduction section of the selected research articles follow the essential moves and steps according to CARS model by Swales (2004). In so doing, ten introduction sections in the research articles were selected in this research. The articles were purposively chosen in the amount of five research articles from each of the journals. The result showed the introduction sections in both journals employed most of the moves and steps of CARS model proposed by Swales (2004).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Introduction such as to give a logical reason for the article and to provoke readers to read it. As Bisri (2016) stated, introduction must include some aspects. Firstly, rational reason that makes the problem deserved to be researched based on the facts, data, reference, and discovery on the previous research. Secondly, problem complexity which means if the problem is not solved immediately. Next is a brief explanation about the position of the problem that is going to be researched in the field of the researcher’s scope. The last one is brief explanation about in what field the problem of the research. Introduction section includes many crucial aspects of the research article. Readers may want to know whether it is own discovery, or maybe it is continuing a previous study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Successful publication in international community obliges the scholars to acquire awareness of move variation in text structure. Text structure or Rhetorical Moves is a pattern that used as ways to organize information from the writing in order to convince and influence the readers with the message of the writing. In spite of the function of Rhetorical Moves is important within writing, but most people who write something academically ignore Rhetorical Patterns. The study of rhetorical moves was authentically developed by Swales (1990 and 2004) to describe a part or section of Research Articles. The move analysis of a genre aims to assign the communicative purposes of a text by categorizing various text units based on the particular communicative purpose of each unit. Several studies in Research Articles (RA) introduction rhetorical patterns have been conducted in various contexts. In the last decades, the study of introduction sections has received a lot of attention from many researchers. Regarding the writer’s background, there are several studies focusing on Non-Native Speakers rhetorical patterns in writing introduction sections of RA (see Ahmad &amp;&nbsp;Yusof, 2012; Arsyad, 2013; Adika, 2014; Arsyad &amp;&nbsp;Wardhana, 2014; Chahal, 2014; Suryani et. al, 2014; Abdullah, 2016; Parnawati et. Al., 2017; Samad et. al., 2017; Muangsamai, 2018; Pujiyanti, 2018). Also, there are several studies conducted in focusing on the difference of rhetorical moves in RA introduction parts with particular concerns for Native Speaker and Non-Native Speaker writers (see Khany &amp;&nbsp;Tazik, 2010; Sheldon, 2011; </span><span class="font2">GEÇİKLİ, 2013; </span><span class="font4">Agrawal 2015; Wannaruk &amp;&nbsp;Amnuai, 2016; Farnia &amp;&nbsp;Barati. 2017; Samanhudi, 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not surprisingly, RAs written in English the main research’s focus with irregular concentration given to RAs of other languages, especially from the perspectives of rhetoric. However, the recent attention is dominantly given to the introduction section of the research article because it is considered as an essential part used by the writers to attract the readers and persuade their interest toward the research topic discussed in the research article (Lim, 2012). In addition. Numerous rhetorical studies in other parts of research article and other type of academic texts have examined using genre-based approaches (Ren, 2011; San, 2012; Fazilatfar, 2016; Vazifehdan &amp;&nbsp;Amjadiparvar, 2016; Zamani &amp;&nbsp;Ebadi, 2016; Ebadi et. al. 2019). These previous studies above suggests that most of introduction of research article is rarely employed the patterns of rhetorical. However, the rhetorical pattern of English Academic is barely found. This present research aimed to examine the rhetorical pattern in introduction section of research article in two disciplines of journal written by English Academics. Moreover, this study used CARS Model by Swales (1990) to examine the rhetorical patterns of English Academic RA introduction section. Through these present findings, it is expected that the author of research article will comprehend in organizing and sequencing the content of introduction section of research article.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">This study employed a mixed method approach which involved quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data. This present research also used content analysis to analyze the data. The quantitative analysis involved simple descriptive statistic of frequency count of moves and steps. In qualitative analysis, the linguistic realizations of the moves and steps were identified based on</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the communicative intent of the moves and steps. This study adopted a qualitative approach based on small number of texts and textual unit therein (Arsyad, 2013). The corpus of research articles was selected purposively from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal for Academic Purposes</span><span class="font4"> from SCIENEDIRECT. The researcher purposively took two different disciplines of journal in order to see whether any significant differences found from it. The article set included total of 10 RA written by English Academics. The instrument used is checklist contains of moves and step using CARS Model proposed by Swales (1990,2004). There are several procedures had been done to identify each moves and steps from the data study; collecting introduction section from chosen journal, reading the whole introduction section, identifying the clue that represent each move and step, classifying the data found which had been given the code for each introduction and the final step is presenting the result in the table.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Table 1 above shows the frequency of Move 1 and its steps in RA introduction of two different discipline of journal. Move 1: Establishing a Research Territory consist of three steps namely, Step 1: Claiming Centrality, Step 2: Making Topic Generalization and Step 3: Reviewing Previous Research. In this study, three of the steps was found in both of the journal discipline </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes.</span><span class="font4"> Step 1: Claiming Centrality is intended to Describe the research problem and providing evidence to support why the topic is important to study. Here is the example from the analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example 1: “A gap between theory and practice has been repeatedly observed in EAP. On the one hand, some EAP research has been criticized for “fad[ing] away before offering well-articulated pedagogical applications (B5)” (Walkova, 2020)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The example above is taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal for Academic Purposes</span><span class="font4">. The example 1 above belongs to Move 1 Step 1: Claiming Centrality because “had been repeatedly observed” indicates that the issue or phenomena is significant to do. For the steps 1 of move 1, both of journal’s discipline have each of the steps. so, there is no difference between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, for step 2: Making Topic Generalization is intended to Provide statements about current state of knowledge, consensus description of phenomena. Here is the example of the step founded in research articles analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example 2: “ADM is “a systematic approach to the mental process used by aircraft pilots to consistently determine the best course of action in response to a given set of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">127 </span><span class="font4">circumstances” A key part of ADM, situation awareness is “the perception of the elements …. (A4)” (Tuccio, 2020)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The example above is taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics.</span><span class="font4"> The example 2 above belongs to Move 1 Step 2: Making Topic Generalization because the statement is about definition of the researcher area. For the steps 2 of move 1, both of journal’s discipline have each of the steps. so, there is no difference between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For step 3: Reviewing Previous Studies is intended to synthesize prior research that further supports the need to study the research problem. Here is the example of the step founded in research articles analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example 3: “Most notable in this regard is Sorjonen and Raevaara's (2014) groundbreaking study of how customers in Finnish kiosks in a systematic and orderly fashion format and time the production of their requests in close coordination with their progression towards the counter and the service provider. Sorjonen and Raevaara (2014) thus convincingly demonstrate that the spatial and temporal relationship between a customer and a service provider has a direct impact on what linguistic …. (A1)” (Fox, 2020)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The example above is taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics.</span><span class="font4"> The Example 3 above belongs to Move 1 Step 3: Reviewing Previous Studies because it is clearly stated the previous research done by Sorjonen and Raevaara's (2014) in study of how customers in Finnish kiosks in a systematic and orderly fashion format and time the production of their requests in close coordination with their progression towards the counter and the service provider. Steps 3 of Move 1 is existed in all of the RA in both of the journals. So, there is no difference between them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Table 2 above shows the frequency of Move 2 founded in research articles’ introduction in both of the journal’s discipline. Move 2: Establishing A Niche consists of three steps in it such as Step 1A: Indicating A Gap, Step 1B: Adding to What Is Known, and Step 2: Presenting Positive Justification. Based on the analysis have done by the researcher, not all of the steps in Move 2: Establishing A Niche were founded in both of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes.</span><span class="font4"> This move was revised in CARS model was revised by Swales (2004) from the previous CARS model (1990). In the previous model, move 2 consist of four steps such as Step 1A; Counter Claiming or, Step 1B: Indicating A Gap or, Step 1C: Question Arising or, Step 1D: Continuing Tradition. Then, in the latest Swales (2004) CARS model the steps were combined and added. He particularly changed the steps in Move 2 (Establishing a Niche), combines Step-1A (counter claiming) and Step-1B (indicating a gap) into a new Step-1A (indicating a gap). Also, Step-1C (raising question) and Step-1D (continuing tradition) are merged into a new Step-1B (adding to what is known). He also adds an optional step or Step-2 (presenting positive justification) in Move 2. In this article, the researcher only found a smaller number of the new steps revised by Swales (2004).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For Step 1A in Move 2: Indicating A Gap was found in three research articles in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics,</span><span class="font4"> meanwhile, in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes,</span><span class="font4"> only one research articles found for having Step 1A: Indicating A Gap. This step is intended to Develop the research problem around the gap or understudied area of the literature Here is the example from the analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example 4: “Eight years since DePalma and Ringer theorized about adaptive transfer, however, transfer scholarship in composition studies and that of EAP and L2 writing still appear separate entities despite greater general attention within composition studies to the presence of multilingual students in institutions of higher education in the United States (B2)” (Wilson, 2020)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The example above is taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes.</span><span class="font4"> The example 4 above belongs to Move 2 Step 1A: Indicating A Gap because the word “however” and “still appear” that indicates the previous studies or previous theory still have a lack. For </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics,</span><span class="font4"> half of the research articles that analyzed state the gap from the previous study or theory. On the other hand, in the articles from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic purposes,</span><span class="font4"> the researcher only found 1 article that state the gap, which is given as example above. Instead of giving a gap, most of articles in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes</span><span class="font4"> only use the word “However” or “Therefore” which to be know these words as the transition in a clause to contrast with the previous sentence. Yet, these words are not enough to indicate the gap without stating what have not been done or the lack from the previous theory or research. So, for Move 2 Step 1A, the two disciplines of journals have a significant difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To complete the statement of gap, Step 1B: Adding to What is Known is needed. This step is intended to emphasize the gap in the existing territory. Surely, the gap that stated need supporting statement to emphasize the reader that the issues taken is significant to be researcher. Here is the example of the step founded in research articles analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example 5: “While adaptive transfer has the potential to bridge this divide, it has so far received only limited theoretical engagement (Donahue, 2018; Hendricks, 2018) and empirical examination (Alexander, DePalma, &amp;&nbsp;Ringer, 2016; Baird &amp;&nbsp;Dilger, 2017). Others, such as Grujicic-Alatriste (2013), have questioned if a methodology for empirically examining adaptive transfer is possible to design at all. (B2)” (Wilson, 2020)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The example above is taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes.</span><span class="font4"> The example 5 above belongs to Move 2 Step 1B: Adding to What is Known because the statement is supported by expert’s citation to emphasize the gap stated in the previous sentence. With expert’s citation, the gap or understudied problem or research area will ensure reader that the research problem or research area is significant to be researched. This step is found only in one research articles in both of the two journals discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Move 2 Step 2: Presenting Positive Justification is none to be found in both of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes</span><span class="font4">. The Step 2: Presenting Positive Justification is intended to follow some gap in the existing literature to justify the present research. However, based on the revised CARS model by Swales (2004), this step is optional. So, this step was not found in any of the research articles researched.</span></p>

Based on the analysis have done by the researcher, most of the research articles’ introductions in both of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes</span><span class="font4"> employed the steps in move 3 proposed by Swales (2004).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first step of Move 3: Occupying the Niche is Step 1A: Outlining Purposes. This step was found in three research articles’ introduction of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics</span><span class="font4"> and in all of the research articles’ introduction of Journal </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of English for Academic Purposes.</span><span class="font4"> This step is intended to Answer the “so what?” question. Here is the example of the step founded in research articles analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example 6: “This paper therefore aims to illustrate and give examples, in an impressionistic way, of this apparent divergence between EAP research and practice” (B3) (Oakey, 2020)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The example above is taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes.</span><span class="font4"> The example 6 above belongs to Move 3 Step 1A: Outlining the Purposes because the authors clearly stated the purpose of the research by stating “this paper therefore aims”. The research articles’ introduction in both of the journals mostly employed this step. Nevertheless, all of the research articles in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes</span><span class="font4"> used as the data in this research employed this step. On the other hand, only half of research articles in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics</span><span class="font4"> employed this step.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, the second step in Move 3 is Step 1B: Announcing Present Research. This step was found in three research articles’ introduction of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics</span><span class="font4"> and in all of the research articles’ introduction of Journal </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of English for Academic Purposes.</span><span class="font4"> This step is intended to Describe the purpose of the study in terms of what the research is going to do or accomplish. Here is the example of the step founded in research articles analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example 7: “From this epistemic perspective, the article addresses two questions. The first is: how do persons with Alzheimer's “do remembering,” or more precisely “do forgetting,” in their interactions with the examining clinician? The second question is: how does “doing forgetting” morph over the progression of the disease: from interactionally troubled, but benign, in early stages to (something like) interactionally pathological in late stages?” (A2) (Schrauf, 2020)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This example 7 above is taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics.</span><span class="font4"> The example 7 above belongs to Move 3 Step 1B: Announcing Present Research because the sentence “the article addresses two</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">questions” indicates in the present research there are two problem that need to be solved. This step was found in all of the research articles’ introduction from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes.</span><span class="font4"> However, this step was found only in three research articles’ introductions from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, the third step in Move 3 is Step 2: Announcing Principal Findings. This step was mostly found in both of the research articles’ introduction of two journal discipline. The Step 2: Announcing Principal Findings is intended to Present a brief, general summary of key findings written. Here is the example of the step founded in research articles analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example 8: “The results, similarly to Cowley-Haselden and Monbec (2019), show a rather low application of theory in EAP textbooks, suggesting that learners’ issues with transition markers might be reinforced by unsuitable teaching materials, as suggested by Lei (2012, p. 273).” (B5) (Walkova, 2020)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The example 8 above is taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes.</span><span class="font4"> The example 8 above belongs to Move 3 Step 2: Announcing Principal Findings because the author states the brief of the result by stating “the result, similarly to….”. The result is usually stated in section result and discussion. However, in introduction section of research articles, the brief of the results or findings also is also existed in it in order to give short description in how the result from the problem will come out. This step was found equally in both of the two discipline journals. So, there is no difference between two discipline journals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The last step in Move 3 is Step 3: Indicating RA Structures. This step also mostly found in both of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics and Journal of English for Academic Purposes.</span><span class="font4"> This step is intended to state how the remainder of the paper is organized. Here is the example of the step founded in research articles analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example 9: “The structure of the paper is as follows. After a brief discussion of data and methodology (Section 2), I turn to the history of each DDM, first by the way, by far the most frequent and richly diversified DDM (Section 3.1), then by the by(e) (3.2), incidentally (3.3), and parenthetically (3.4)” (A3) (Traugott, 2020)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This example 9 above is taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics.</span><span class="font4"> The example 8 above belongs to Move 3 Step 3: Indicating RA structures because the author clearly stated and explained the structure of research articles. “The structure of the paper is as follows” sentence become the sign to know that it is describing the research article’s structure. This step was found in four research articles’ introductions from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics.</span><span class="font4"> Meanwhile, this step was only found in three research articles’ introductions from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of the examples above are explaining the steps of each move from CARS model by Swales (2004). The results also show the different number on both of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journals of English for Academic Purposes.</span><span class="font4"> All steps in Move 1: Establishing a Territory was found in all of the research articles. It can be interpreted that this move is regarded as an obligatory move by English Academic in their writing. It can be happened because this step is crucial part explaining and stating the important of the problem which is become an initial step in doing research. This is also happened in previous research by several researchers (Adnan, 2009; Arsyad, 2013; Parnawati, 2017) that conducted research about rhetorical moves in Introduction section by Indonesian Speakers. It can be seen that both Indonesian speakers and English Academics regard Moves 1 as Obligatory move. Meanwhile, Swales (2004) also classified this move as obligatory move and the possibility of cycling patterns in the introduction section. In the other hand, all steps in Move 2: Establishing a Niche was found in not half of the total number of research articles’ introduction from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes.</span><span class="font4"> Even, step 2 in Move 2 was found in none of the all-research articles’ introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">both of journal’s discipline. It can be interpreted that this move is regarded as an optional move by English Academics in their writing. It may be happened because the authors of RA refer to avoid the lack or understudied problem in the research area. Instead, most of the author just use research problem to justify the research instead of stating the gap of knowledge. Lastly, move 3: Occupying a Niche was found in most of the research articles’ introduction from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes.</span><span class="font4"> It can be interpreted that move 3 is regarded as an obligatory move by English Academics in their writing. It can be happened because this move is the part to describe the present research that will be done, also the authors try to attract the reader with the content of the research articles, as introduction is the first part to be read. In both of the journals’ discipline that were analyzed by researcher, there is no significant different in the patterns of rhetorical proposed by Swales (2004) in his CARS model. Only, there is a slight difference in how the authors sequence the moves and steps. In </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Pragmatics</span><span class="font4"> the author tends to put move 1, especially step 1 which is claiming centrality as the beginning of their introduction. In the other hand, in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of English for Academic Purposes, </span><span class="font4">the author tends to write the beginning of the introduction with outlining the purpose of present research.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Novelties</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The novelty in this study is the findings of rhetorical patterns used in research article’s introduction written by English Academics. By recognizing the patterns of introduction of research article, it can be helpful for both author and reader to comprehend the organization of introduction. Moreover, there are some new findings from this study that can be useful for students or scholars in writing introduction section in order to publish the article to national or international journal.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">From the analysis conducted by the researcher that aims to know the Rhetorical Patterns in Introduction section of Research Articles written by English Academics, there are several conclusions can be drawn. First, it is found that English Academics in both of the journal discipline regard Move 2: Establishing a Territory as an obligatory move that must be included in every introduction section. Second, it is found that English Academics in both journals’ discipline regard Move 2: Establishing a Niche as an optional move, as the most of writers tend to use research problem to justify their research. The last, it is found that English Academics in both of the journals’ discipline regard Move 3: Occupying a Niche as an obligatory move as the author wants to describe their present study. Generally, it can be concluded that the use of rhetorical patterns is not depended on how goo the authors in mastering written language of the research. Instead, the author must have the rhetorical realization in writing their introduction. Considering the importance of rhetorical structures in academic writing, the findings of this research is significance to help the students or scholars who want to write research article. By recognizing the use of rhetorical patterns in their writing, it is expected that the author understands better in organizing and sequencing the content of their introduction of research articles, as this part is the first part to be read and should be written persuasively to attract reader to read the rest of article. Furthermore, lecturer is also expected to give material about rhetorical structures for their students the urgency of writing an article is increasing.</span></p>
