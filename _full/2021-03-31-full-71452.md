The location is not so far from the capital city of Jakarta and the ease of accessibility becomes an advantage for this tourist village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Marketing is the spearhead of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">number of consumers (in this case tourists) who come to visit and spend time and expenses in an area. One of the purposes of this is to be able to convey or provide information to the public about a product or tourist attraction that of course is expected to attract tourists to visit. If the information needs have been met then the satisfaction of tourists can also be met (Anshar and Batubara, 2019).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The number of forms of promotion is not a benchmark for the success of a marketing activity. Choosing the right media according to the characteristics and beha-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">vior of the market segment is important. Continuous modernization requires that the promotional forms placed through the right media are placed through the right media.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">E-tourism is one form of media or promotional tool on the rise now. The ease of accessing information through the internet as well as the increasing use of social media coupled with the large number of internet users in Indonesia makes this promotional media very useful.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LITERATURE REVIEW</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Village Tourism</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Village tourism is one form of application of community-based and sustainable tourism development. Tourist villages as a form of rural tourism can provide many benefits to the development efforts of various resources owned by rural areas (Sugiarti, 2008). The development of tourist villages can have a positive impact on the villagers themselves, such as the new employment land for the community so as to lower the unemployment rate in the village. In addition, the tourism village that carries the concept of ecotourism will make a village able to maintain the sustainability of nature and culture of the village. Another thing is, a tourist village can make a village into an independent village because it can provide alternative jobs that can be entered by the local community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Related to the concept of tourism village development, Pearce (1995) interprets the development of tourist villages as a process that emphasizes ways to develop or advance tourist villages. More specifically, the development of tourist villages is interpreted as efforts to equip and improve tourist facilities to meet the needs of tourists. Rural tourism is a tourism consisting of a whole rural experience, natural attractions, traditions, unique elements that can overall attract tourists (Joshi, 2012), and every tourist must have different motivations and desires between one and the other which makes their motivation background in determining where to do tourist activities (Sari, 2019).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Promotion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Promotion is any form of communication used by the company to inform, persuade, or remind people of the products, services, shadows, ideas or involvement of the company and the public with the intent to accept and perform the actions as desired by the company (Sigit in Wardana, 2015). What a company or business entity wants is the sale of products that they own in the form of goods or services so that they can benefit in the form of economic benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The economic benefits that will be gained of course come from the spending made by tourists during their visit and spending time in the destination of tourism, the higher the amount of money spent, it will automatically impact the increase in income from the tourism sector of a region (Sari, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Promotion is a process of introducing products to consumers in an interesting way. The promotion is included in marketing that has the principle of communication to attract the public’s interest in the objects offered. The purpose of the promotion is to influence and inform the public that there are products offered (Marpaung and Bahar, 2002). To be able to attract tourists</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">is by displaying the tourist activities that have, without the activity will not be able to attract tourists to be able to visit (Sari, 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus the promotion of tourism is an effort made by the tourists to be able to attract the attention of tourists by putting together a tourism product that is appropriate to be sold to tourists. A form of tourism promotion activity is carried out in a relatively short time by prioritizing activities for the main purpose of increasing the appeal of tourist products to prospective tourists.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Promotion Media</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Media is one of the containers of distribution of works so that it can be seen and felt by consumers. Media can be interpreted as a supporting tool to conduct an activity. Promotion is an effort to tailor travel products to the demand of tourism, so that the products offered become more attractive. Tourism promotion activities can be done through various media such as print and electronic media. Promotional media that can be used are leaflets, booklets, catalogs, videos, advertisements, newspapers and others (Marpaung and Bahar, 2002) and promotions are one of the four basic elements of marketing on the website (Stankov, Ćurčić and Dragićević, 2010).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The official website of a destination is one of the important elements that is now attached to the destination itself. The use of the internet is massif, making the relationship between tourism and the internet as one of the promotional media platforms. Promotional media is created to influence consumers to buy products offered and packaged in such a way as to look perfect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The advantage of using electronic media in the form of a website for a travel agent is that they can display images and videos from almost any destination in the world (Stankov, Ćurčić and Dragićević, 2010), the hotel can display the rooms it has, as well as the utilization of the website</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">for promotional activities of a destination, the tour destination manager can display images of all the resources it has.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In promotional media in the form of websites, the basic use and level of use of the destination’s official website is a must-note. In detail, which should be considered more observantly in the form of domain name (adequacy of domain name, adequate TDL, existence of country code), basic year of website site, website type, credibility and functionality of website site (website owner existence, copyright and data quotation, update), quality of content presentation (navigation – menu bar in all website sites, navigation function, quick search and sitemap-, color contrast , availability of foreign languages), visibility and search engine devices, internet promotion techniques (the presence of links, link structure (travel and tourism sectors, non tourism sector, banner presence), online PR (news section, chat, forums, online polling), the presence of email marketing elements, the presence of ratings - based on the number of visitors and the region of the ranking of origin, country) (Stankov, Ćurčić and Dragićević, 2010).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>E-Tourism</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">E-tourism is a form of travel recommendation, but it can also be in the form of an application that can help to organize and organize the user’s travel (Sebastia </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font3">, 2009). The Minister of Tourism at the opening of the Cultural Festival in Bali pointed out that e-tourism is a digital platform that connects all tourism stakeholders, facilitates the licensing process, integrates all tourism activities and provides convenience for all tourists exploring the charms of Indonesia through an easy-to-use app, anytime and anywhere (Noviyanti, 2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every tourist destination, including Cimande Tourism Village certainly competes with other similar tourist destinations in an effort to attract tourists to visit, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">can reach all layers of community with the most minimal obstacles, therefore the use of means of communication and promotion such as official website is very important (Fernández-Cavia </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font3">, 2014). The official website of a destination can also be used to provide accurate information and have several advantages and advantages. Excellence content in travel services is an important strategy in an e-tourism web design to attract tourists (Ku and Chen, 2015).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to provide clarity of information and promotion of e-tourism in the form of a website, the official tourist destination, then there must be some important aspects that must be fulfilled. On any website must include several aspects, namely: 1) technical aspects (homepage, ease of use and access, and positioning), 2) communicative aspects (number of content or selection and use of language, 3) relational aspects (interactivity, social web, mobile communication), and 4) persuasive aspects (marketing, branding, discourse analysis) (Fernández-Cavia </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font3">, 2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">METHODS</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The technique used to analyze is a descriptive technique, i.e. all collected data is analyzed and searched for common thread with theories available so that it can interpret and draw conclusions based on the description of answers given by the source about the activities, media and messages stated in the promotion. Primary data is taken from tour participants, local governments and local communities, while secondary data is obtained through literature studies, past research and others.

<p><span class="font3">views, documentation and litelature study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Cimande Tourism Village website has a domain name desawisatacimande. com. This name is selected because it is considered memorable by the user. Ciman-de Tourism Village website was created on</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">December 27, 2019 and will end on December 27, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a representation of the form of etourism, the official website of Cimande Tourism Village must and should have ru-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">les or meet the standard criteria of a website. Stankov, Ćurčić and Dragićević (2010) explained that there are at least a few things to note in the creation of the website including visibility and ranking of search engines, promotion techniques through the internet, online public relations, and elements of e-mail marketing as well as ranking / order of visitors.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Visibility and Search Engine</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Visibility in the website is the visibility of the site on search engines (Handayani, Febriyanto and Shofwatullah, 2019). This visibility should and should be optimized to achieve the level of website user visits desired by the tour village website manager. The visibility of a site is influenced by factors such as keywords and search engines used. Cimande Tourism Village website has a fairly good level of visibility. With the keyword “Cimande Tourism Village” then at least Cimande tourism village website how many on the 5 largest searches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The search engines used in the author’s observations are Google, Yahoo and Bing. The determination of this search engine is considered a frequent use by tourists. On Google search engines, Ci-mande tourism village website is ranked 16th and is found on the second page of the search engine (Figure x). Thus it can be known that Cimande tourism village website search on Google search engine is considered bad. This is due to the lack of updates made by the website manager as well as the lack of information provided by the website manager so that internet users prefer to search for regional information to other websites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On Yahoo and Bing search engines, The Cimande Tourism Village website is in first place. Website rankings on a search engine may vary due to several factors. The ranking factor of a website in search engines is influenced by the algorithm of website ranking, search activity, websites</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">visited up to the device used (Andri, 2009; Santoso, 2009). This is because each search engine records all search traces performed by the user of the device so that later when the user searches for an information will always be associated with information related to the previous information.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/71452-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:169pt;height:87pt;"><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/71452-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:117pt;height:38pt;">

<p><span class="font3">Figure 3. Search engine by Bing</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Basically a lot of ways are done so that website managers can put their website at the top of the rankings. In Handayani, Febriyanto and Shofwatullah (2019) revealed that the implementation of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) can improve search engine results pages (SERP) websites in search engines, the volume and quality of traffic visits from google search engines by</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">up to 70 percent. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a systematically performed technique and process to optimize website visibility or visibility. This technique aims to increase the number of visits to a website by utilizing search engine algorithms.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">due to the absence of special officers in managing the website every day and the lack of sufficient funds for the availability of the website, the manager still relies on the available website only. Therefore, the author recommends that managers work with other institutions or institutions to meet human resources needs in improving knowledge and skills related to the promotion of especially websites. In addition, the manager can also ask the relevant institutions or institutions to cooperate in the promotion activities of Cimande Tourism Village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Cimande Tourism Village conducts promotional activities in the form of public relations and publicity and direct marketing. Research shows that Cimande Tourism Village website has a fairly good level of visibility by using search engines namely Google, Yahoo and Bing. Promotional techniques are carried out by linking information related to tourism, namely information about the activities of Cimande</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tourism Village itself. Online public relations are not yet available. Email websites are available even though they are still minimal in use. The manager has not recorded the visitors so the ranking related to the visitor does not exist.</span></p>
