There are many factors of motivation that affect how a manager views his role in CSR. In line with this,</span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5"> Jang and Ardichvili (2020) </span></a><span class="font5">suggest that HRD must have a link with CSR to ensure its sustainability. This is why an investigation into the motives of managers with regards to their role in CSR is crucial for HR practitioners within CSR. CSR can take on a variety of distinct meanings in different nations or industry sectors, depending on the legal, social, and economic environment; as a result, it is difficult to define an organization's &quot;Social Responsibility&quot;</span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5"> (Tukur, Shehu, Mammadi, &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">Sulaiman, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">.

<p><span class="font5">may be related to the existence of CSR laws requiring companies to practice CSR</span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5"> (Zainal,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. Because of this obligation, we might conclude that legal motivation is an important factor in the role of the CSR manager. However, we can not overlook the company's economic importance in CSR, such as obtaining a social license from the community, ensuring operational safety, and improving the company's reputation or image </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Cesar, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, the direct and indirect effects of globalization, such as the expansion of CSR waves, the spread of multinational corporations (MNCs) to developing countries, may raise ethical issues for managers involved in CSR implementation </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Chambers, Chapple, Moon, &amp;&nbsp;Sullivan, 2003)</span></a><span class="font5">. As a result, the CSR manager's role is challenging, as they must meet the expectations of both their organization and the community. As a result, it is critical to investigate the factors that influence the CSR manager's role. Specifically, CSR is identified by its underlying strategic purposes (e.g. legitimacy, responsibility for social externality, and competitive advantage), its drivers (e.g. market, social regulations, and government regulations) and its domain motives (e.g. economic, legal, and ethical) </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Visser, 2008)</span></a><span class="font5">. The third attribute, namely, the manager’s domain motive to CSR responsibilities, is one of the focuses of this study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This article is based on</span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5"> Schwartz and Carroll (2003) </span></a><span class="font5">CSR model, which proposed three domains of influence on managers' decisions to implement CSR. These are as follows: (1) economic, (2) legal, and (3) ethical. This theory is relevant to the context of studies that question the motives of CSR managers in the existence of CSR legislation. This model was derived from</span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5"> Carroll's (1991) </span></a><span class="font5">CSR pyramid; however,</span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5"> Schwarts and Carroll (2003)</span></a><span class="font5"> removed the philanthropic domain from their model because business philanthropic activities such as charitable giving can be motivated by either an ethical or an economic motive. Economic motivation implies that managers use CSR as an economic tool to help businesses achieve their profit goals </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Friedman, 2007)</span></a><span class="font5">. Legal motivation in the Indonesian context can be related to companies' obligations to CSR laws, such as Law No. 40/2007 on Limited Liability Companies, which require them to conduct CSR during their operations. While ethical responsibility is associated with company activities and practices that are expected or prohibited by society when conducting business </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Gjølberg, 2011)</span></a><span class="font5">. Ethics appears to have the least influence on CSR activities in developing countries </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Visser, 2008)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CSR has been a significant focus in Western countries, but unfortunately, CSR in Indonesia is far less studied. According to</span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5"> Kemp (2001) </span></a><span class="font5">CSR in Indonesia was a reasonably new concept prior to the fall of the &quot;new order regime&quot; in the mid-1990s, during which time a few companies only used it. Local districts have successfully requested more autonomy and authority from the central government after experiencing thirty-two years of being under a highly centralized government regime. This also includes any demand for contributions from the company, which previously went to the federal government in Jakarta under President Suharto. Businesses and firms that are involved in natural resources have had to implement CSR requirements, which was an impetus for the government to mandate CSR legislation. Some of the world's first laws on CSR are No. 25/2007 and the LLC Law No. 40/2007, both of which were passed in 2007 </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Zainal, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. Following the resignation of President Soeharto in 1999, all of Indonesia's CSR laws were instituted. CSR practices in Indonesia are now mandatory because of these laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the context of mandated CSR laws in Indonesia, the purpose of this study is to determine the motivation that drives managers to take on CSR role. In the context of this mandated CSR, the perspective of CSR managers from mining companies should be investigated. For these reasons, the following research questions are addressed in this article The main research question is “What is the influence of economic, legal and ethical motivation to manager to take a role on CSR in mining companies?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This study will help advance our understanding of CSR and HRD. It is, first and foremost, designed to supplement the framework developed by</span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5"> Hemmingway and</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">Maclagan (2004) </span></a><span class="font5">who formulated the notion of &quot;locus of responsibility&quot;. CSR is a method that helps to fill the gaps that emerge when a company competes in a competitive environment and places requirements on managers from various stakeholders. The above statement suggests that CSR motives need to be analyzed to comprehend CSR roles. Also, the manager in charge of CSR serves as a human resources manager who is tasked with connecting the corporation to the community. It follows that it is essential to evaluate what his motivations are when it comes to CSR implementation. The data would help establish CSR policies and programs that respect all interests, including the interests of the corporation, the community, and the government. Third, since CSR was created with the purpose of practising socially responsible HRD, managers have a duty to implement and execute every facet of social responsibility activities, including education for businesses on social responsibility and to use HRD strategies to foster socially conscious business practices </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Jang &amp;&nbsp;Ardichvili,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">2020)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three CSR domain motives defined as this study attempts to identify the motivations of CSR managers, whether it is based on legal motive as an obligation to implement the legislation, or there are other factors that motivate them.</span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5"> Schwartz and</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">Carroll (2003) </span></a><span class="font5">model offered three domains on a company manager decision to apply CSR. There are three of them: (1) economic, (2) legal, and (3) ethical (see</span><a href="#bookmark3"><span class="font5"> Figure 1.</span></a><span class="font5">). </span><a href="#bookmark3"><span class="font5">Figure 1.</span></a><span class="font5"> demonstrates how the three areas of economic, ethical, and legal duties overlap and interact. However, CSR efforts are rarely motivated purely by one domain.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/79588-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:260pt;height:209pt;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Figure 1. Three domain motives of CSR</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5">Source : Adopted from</span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5"> Schwartz &amp;&nbsp;Carroll (2003)</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ideal overlap is found in the model's centre, when economic, legal and ethical responsibilities are all met simultaneously. Other pure domains and overlapping domains in the model may reflect real-world business circumstances that must be studied and examined to demonstrate the problems that business decision-makers encounter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In respect to</span><a href="#bookmark3"><span class="font5"> Figure 1.</span></a><span class="font5">, using these three CSR domain in this research may help to discover the internal motivation of mining company managers to take on CSR roles. This study questioned whether the existence of CSR law became the dominant domain in influencing CSR manager roles in Indonesia. This model provides other motivational domains, such as economics and legal that can also affect CSR manager roles. Study of </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">Ismail, Kassim, Amit, &amp;&nbsp;Rasdi (2014),</span></a><span class="font5"> which takes CSR orientation, consisting of economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic, as a predictor in identifying CSR manager roles in companies in Malaysia mentions that economic responsibility has a higher ranking in the orientation or motivation of CSR managers in Malaysia. Meanwhile, legal responsibility is the lowest orientation or motivation for CSR managers in Malaysia. CSR is concerned with human behaviour, and it is a complex process involving a wide range of organizations with varying business models and stakeholders. As a result, CSR has evolved into a concept encompassing corporate social responsiveness and all social activities in which corporate executives play a significant part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The economic domain often connects a company's CSR to its performance or profit. This regards CSR solely as a tool for the corporation to achieve its financial goal, which is profit </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Berger, Cunningham, &amp;&nbsp;Drumwright, 2007; Dare, 2016)</span></a><span class="font5">. This domain is also known as the narrow CSR perspective, in which businesses will only engage in CSR-related activities if there is a clear link to financial performance, and CSR is a tool to achieve this economic goal (Dare, 2016; Maas &amp;&nbsp;Liket, 2011). This realm of CSR states that CSR initiatives from firms are primarily evaluated in a purely economic manner to pursue a clear link to financial performance. So, hypothesis 1 can be developed from this domain motive.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">H</span><span class="font1">1</span><span class="font5">: Economic domain motive has a significantly positive influence on CSR manager role in Indonesian mining companies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The Legal domain discusses why firms want to practice CSR in order to obey or comply with the law. The law is a form of 'codified ethics,' which means that it is a way of fairness developed by legislators after taking into account diverse societal values </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Schwartz &amp;&nbsp;Carroll, 2003)</span></a><span class="font5">. Given Indonesia's CSR regulations, it is reasonable to infer that CSR is exclusively motivated by the company's compliance with the legislation </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Zainal, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. However, whether, if so, and why each firm handles CSR differently when executing the same legislation should be asked. Based on this concept, hypothesis 2 is developed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">H</span><span class="font1">2</span><span class="font5">: Legal domain motive has a significantly positive influence on CSR manager role in Indonesian mining companies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, the ethical domain is frequently associated with a broad view of CSR or a normative approach to CSR. In general, the ethical domain refers to firm operations consistent with the community's expectations and other important stakeholders both locally and globally </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Karaosmanoglu, Altinigne, &amp;&nbsp;Isiksal, 2016)</span></a><span class="font5">. However, it is seen to be impossible to incorporate all stakeholders' expectations because societal norms vary and rely on context. Hypothesis 3 is built from this perspective.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/79588-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:211pt;height:137pt;">

<p><a href="#bookmark4"><span class="font5">Figure 2.</span></a><span class="font5"> explains the theoretical framework of this study. Figure explained that the motivation of managers to take CSR roles is influenced by three motivations, namely economic domain motive, legal domain motive and ethical domain motive. This study will look at the domains that are the largest in conjunction with CSR managers in mining companies.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Research Method</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Selected CSR managers and representatives from mining companies operating in South Sumatera Province, Indonesia, participated in the study. The number of coal mining companies operating in the area is 114 companies which become the population of this study </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Dinas ESDM Provinsi Sumsel, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. As a result, it was projected that there were 114 managers or staff related with CSR function in those companies. This is because not all companies have CSR managers and CSR functions are held by other parts such as public relations or operational managers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the early stages, we produced a list of the company and the manager's name and the connections received from coworkers who knew the manager's references. Then, all contacts are contacted using Whatsapp and email apps. Hardcopy questionnaires are mailed, and researchers attempt to maintain contact with firm contacts to inquire about questionnaire completion status. Finally, the entire questionnaire can be completed and returned, or it can be taken immediately by the researcher</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The research tool is a questionnaire with four sections covering questions on the economic, ethical, legal, and role in CSR as perceived by CSR managers. Questions about the role of CSR managers were adapted from Ismail,</span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5"> Kassim, Amit and Rasdi (2014) </span></a><span class="font5">while questions about CSR motivation were adapted from</span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5"> Schwartz and Carroll Model (2003).</span></a><span class="font5"> Each question in the first four sections required a response based on a scale of 1-7, with 1 being &quot;totally untrue&quot; and 7 being &quot;completely truthful.&quot; Because it increased the variety of the answers, the 7-point Likert scale was chosen over the 5-point Likert scale </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Joshi, Kale, Chandel, &amp;&nbsp;Pal, 2015)</span></a><span class="font5">The first portion on CSR role has eight tasks designed to measure the manager's role on CSR. &quot;The CSR manager should assume responsibility for developing a formal policy on sustainable actions toward the community,&quot; as an example. The second segment, which contains 29 elements, is concerned with CSR</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">approaches to CSR's economic, legal, and ethical domains. The following are examples of questions from each category: (1) Economic domain: &quot;Each company must retain a strong competitive position”, (2) Legal domain: &quot;It's critical to be a law-abiding business citizen”, (3) Ethical domain: “It is critical to perform in a manner consistent with cultural mores and ethical norms.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The data collected will be analysed by SEM PLS using smart PLS 3. This analysis will produce an output in the form of a model about the influence of CSR motivation on the CSR role of managers. The analytical steps to be carried out in this study are </span><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font5">(Purwanto, Asbari, &amp;&nbsp;Santoso, 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">: (1) Forming the initial model; (2) Check the loading factor of each indicator used in the initial model; (3) Perform iteration steps that aim to abort indicators that are under the rule of thumb; (4) Checking the validity and reliability of the model formed as a result of the iteration process; (5) See the significance of the model that has been made by bootstrapping; (6) The final model of the influence of CSR motivation on the CSR role of managers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The initial model that is constructed in this study has three independent variables of CSR motive domains: economic, legal, and ethical.

<p><span class="font5">After eliminating the indicators that do not qualify,</span><a href="#bookmark9"><span class="font5"> Figure 3.</span></a><span class="font5"> is produced. It can be seen; of the three independent variables used in this study, only two variables qualified the adequacy of indicators to be analyzed in the study, namely variable economic domain motive and legal domain motive. While the ethical domain motive can not be used because there are not enough indicator adequacy requirements, which only leaves 1 reflective indicator. For dependent variables, the role of CSR manager can still be used because it has qualified the adequacy of indicators with three reflective indicators.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5">above can be seen only two variables that affect the role of CSR managers, namely, economic domain motive and legal domain motive. From smart PLS, regression models can be generated from the influence of CSR motives on CSR role managers, as follows: Y = a + 0,736 X1 + 0,182 X2 + Ɛ.........................................................................................(1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Y : Role of CSR Manager</span></p>

Validity is seen from the Average Variance Extractive value, which shows the results for all variables in the model above 0.5 which means all variations in the model are valid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reliability is seen from three values: Cronbach's Alpha, Rho A, and Composite Reliability. For various economic domain motives obtained two values from cronbach's Alpha and Rho A are below 0.7 which means invalid. However, for composite reliability values are above 0.7 which means valid. We concluded that variable economic domain motive is valid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Likewise, for variable legal domain motive and role of CSR manager, all assessments of both Cronbach's Alpha, Rho A, and Composite Reliability show reliable values above 0.7. These two variables; legal domain motive and role of CSR manager, are considered reliable.</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark12"><span class="font5">Table 2.</span></a><span class="font5"> shows the significance between the path of economic domain motive to the role of CSR manager t-statistics worth 14.530, which means greater than the t-table of 1.96.

<p><a href="#bookmark14"><span class="font5">Table 3. </span></a><span class="font5">shows which is more important than the two dependent variables; economic domain motive and legal domain motive. From the path coefficient analysis, obtained variable economic domain motive is statistically more important than the legal domain motive in driving the role of CSR manager. This means that the motivation of managers in taking on the role of CSR manager is more due to economic motives, such as profit, not because of the mandate of the Law.</span><a href="#bookmark13"><span class="font5"> Figure 5.</span></a><span class="font5"> shows that managers in this study are more likely to have economic domain motive in their role of CSR manager which is worth 0.736, while the legal domain motive is only worth 0.182 less than the economic domain motive.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The study has found important findings for understanding managers' behavior, especially what motivates them to take on CSR roles within companies. This is coupled with the Indonesian context, which has CSR Law that mandates CSR to be carried out by companies, including mining companies. From the findings and discussions in the previous section, it can be concluded that only two factors motivate managers, namely economic domain motive and legal domain motive. While variable ethical domain motive is not significant in the results of this study. This means economic motive factors, which direct managers to implement CSR with the aim of profit motive more dominantly influencing managers in CSR roles. Meanwhile, the legal motive factor based on managers' compliance to implement CSR law, although significantly influential, has an important performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These results indicate that policies carried out by the government to require companies to implement CSR cannot be separated from the economic motives of the business to benefit. This means that even though the CSR Law is aimed at improving the welfare of the community, but in practice it cannot be separated from the motives of economic profits of the company, such as building an image, ensuring the company's operations and even getting a social license from the community.</span></p>
