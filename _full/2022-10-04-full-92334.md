<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Chili is an important and popular commodity in Indonesia which has a high economic value. This spice is one of the most widely used for household consumption, industry, and in food processing (Ismawati, 2016). However, the average productivity of chili in Indonesia is low. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics (2022), in 2021 national chili production in Indonesia decreased by 8.09% compared to the production in 2020. The national chili production decreased to 1.39 million tons in 2021 while in 2020 the national chili production was 1.5 million tons. One of the factors that lower chili production in Indonesia is because of fusarium wilt disease invasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Wilt disease on chili commonly caused by the fungal infection </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fusarium oxysporum</span><span class="font2"> f. sp </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">capsici</span><span class="font2">. The use of synthetic fungicides to control </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">F. oxysporum</span><span class="font2"> f.sp. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">capsici</span><span class="font2"> has been widely practiced and proven less effective in controlling this fungus. Besides, an excessive amount of applied synthetic fungicides lead to severe environmental pollution. One of the efforts that become a moral responsibility for us to reduce the use of synthetic fungicides is to utilize a more environmentally friendly approach like Rhizobacteria that potentially act as bioprotectants and biostimulants. As bioprotectants Rhizobacteria can produce substances that have biological activity as antimicrobials that act to protect plants from pathogents. While as biostimulants, Rhizobacteria can increase plant growth because they produce substances that have biological activity as growth promoters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The purpose of this study was to examine the potential of Rhizobacteria as</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">bioprotectants by challenging their ability to inhibit the growth of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">F. oxysporum</span><span class="font2"> f.sp. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">capsici</span><span class="font2"> in vitro and to examine the potential of rhizobacteria as biostimulants by testing their ability to produce IAA compounds and mediated the growth of chili.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Test of Rizobacterial Potential as Biostimulant</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The potential test of rhizobacteria as biostimulants was conducted by testing the ability of rhizobacteria to produce IAA compounds and testing their ability to increase the growth of chili plants. The test of the ability of rhizobacteria to produce IAA was conducted by colorimetric method based on Wahyudi et al. (2011). Rhizobacteria were grown for 48 hours in Nutrient Broth medium added with 1 mM L-tryptophan. The rhizobacterial culture was centrifuged at 1610 x g for 30 min, then the supernatant was separated from the bacterial sediment and filtered with Millipore filter paper (0.45 mm). Furthermore, IAA content in the filtrate was detected using Salkowski reagent (1 ml 0.5 M FeCl3 and 49 ml 35% HClO4). A total of 1 ml of rhizobacterial filtrate was put into a 2 ml eppendorf tube and then 1 ml of Salkowski reagent was added. The eppendorf tube containing the solution was incubated in a dark room at room temperature for 30 minutes. A change in the color of the solution in the eppendorf</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">tube to pink indicates that the rhizobacteria produce IAA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Test the ability of rhizobacteria in increasing the growth of chili plants was carried out by invigorating chili seeds with 2% suspension of each rhizobacteria. The 2% concentration was obtained from 2 ml of culture in PPDC media (5 g potato extract, 5 g peptone, 10 g dextrose, 1000 ml Coconut water) per 100 ml of water. The design used in this study was a randomized group design (RAK) with 5 treatments and 5 replicates. The treatments were control (KTRL); seed invigoration with P. agglomerans TR78 suspension (PAGS); seed invigoration with K. pneumoniae KC66 suspension (KLPE); seed invigoration with K. pneumoniae SW04 suspension (KLPN); seed invigoration with S. maltophilia KC29 suspension (STMA). Each replicate consisted of 10 plants. Seeds were then planted in pots that had been filled with planting media. Growth parameters observed were plant height, number of leaves, root dry weight, crown dry weight, root length, leaf area, and leaf chlorophyll content. Measurement of leaf chlorophyll</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The results of colorimetric tests on rhizobacterial cultures showed that 4 tested rhizobacterial cultures experienced a color change from clear to pink (Figure 2). Meudt and Gaines (1967) reported that Salkowski reagent contains 35% HClO4 and 10 mM FeCl3 and when reacted with rhizobacterial cultures containing IAA there will be a color change from colorless to pink indicating that IAA is oxidized by HClO4. Rahman et al. (2010) reported that the color change to pink indicates that IAA is oxidized by HClO4 and then oxidized IAA reacts with FeCl3 to form tris-(indole-3-acetato) iron (III) complex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Kamnev et al. (2001) reported that the compound tris-(indole-3-acetato) iron (III) complex has the molecular formula FeC30H24N3O6 or Fe[(C8H6N)-CH2COO]3). Meudt and Gaines (1967) reported that IAA, 5-Hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, and indole-3-acetamide compounds will be pink when reacted with Salkowski reagent. Colorimetric method can be used to determine the concentration of IAA, where the pinker the test solution, the higher the concentration of IAA in the solution. This is because one molecule of Fe will bind three molecules of IAA to form a tris-(indole-3-acetato) iron (III) complex.</span></p>
