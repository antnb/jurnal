<p><span class="font7">Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi live in a symbiotic mutualism with plant roots and helps plant absorb nutrients and also able to live in various places. The study aimed to identify arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in rizhosphere of several grass and cacao through microscopic method based on morphological characteristics and was conducted from December 2013 to March 2014. The methods used in this study were spore isolation using wet sieving and root staining techniques.

<p><span class="font9">P</span><span class="font8">roduction and productivity of crops in last 10 years, significantly declines were primarily due to ecological degradation of soil fertility and significantly increase of fertilizer price (Nasaruddin, 2012 . Efforts to overcome limitation of fertilizer and environmental damage are through application of soil biotechnology such as soil microbe services and technologies of natural fertilizer. One of the biotechnological developments in soil microbial fertilizer is by utilizing the symbiotic microbe such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is a fungus that lives in a symbiotic mutualism manner with plant roots and grow in the root cortex cells (Bundrett </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font8">, 1996 .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Almost 100 percent Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi observed in grasses of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gramineae</span><span class="font8"> family and 70% found in the rhizosphere of plants such</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">of cacao (Nasaruddin, 2009 . Gramineae grasses that can grow in a critical region allows better mycorrhizal fungi growth. The grasses mention above namely Bahia grass, Elephant grass, and Nut--‐‑grass. While the number of mycorrhizal fungi in cacao currently found lower than in grasses, because cacao is commonly a cultivated crop that maintained soil fertility resulted in lowering mycorrhizal fungi diversity. Khan (1993 mentions that mycorrhizal fungi can protect plant from certain toxic elements such as heavy metals and according to Wright and Uphadhyaya (1998 , arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi producing glycoprotein glomalin that is very correlated with soil aggregate stability. This study aims to identify arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in rhizosphere of grasses and cacao and also to determine whether or not arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi infection in root tissues of grasses and in cacao.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>MATERIALS AND METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The research was conducted from December 2013 to March 2014. Rhizophere soil sampling and grass roots done in Penelokan village, while soil sampling and roots of cacao taken in Kintamani village and identification of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi conducted in the Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Molecular Biology, Udayana University.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Materials needed in this study were 100 grams of rhizophere soil and root samples from the Cacao Cacao (</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Theobroma cacao</span><span class="font8"> L. and 4 species of grasses namely Bahia grass (</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paspalum notatum</span><span class="font8"> , Reed grass (</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Imperata cylindrica</span><span class="font8"> , Elephant grass (</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Pennisetum purpureum</span><span class="font8"> , and Nut--‐‑grass (</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cyperus rotundus</span><span class="font8"> , hydrogen peroxide, lactic acid 90%, glycerol, potassium hydroxide phosphate, and sterile water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Necessary tools in this study were the autoclave, sieve size of 1 mm, 500 µμm, 212 µμm, 106 µμm, 53 µμm, tweezers, petridish, shaker, electric scales, erlenmeyer, micro tube, compound microscope and a stereo microscope, a water bath, slide glass and cover glass, and pasteur pipette.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>PROCEDURES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Sampling of soil and roots were taken at each of the selected plants at 3 points in a depth of 30 cm from the base of the stems of plants, 100 grams of sample was weighed, and collected in a paper bag with its root sample, labeled and stored in a refrigerators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Isolation of spores from soil samples, performed with wet filter technique. A total of 100 grams of dried soil samples were given water up to volume 1000 ml, stired for 2 minutes and filtered with a 1 mm sieve, 500 µμm, 212 µμm, 106 µμm and 53 µμm. The precipitate remaining in the sieve of 500 µμm, 212 µμm, 106 µμm and 53 µμm were sprayed with tap water and poured into centrifuge tubes. The precipitate was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was then poured into a petri dish and then examined</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">under a stereo microscope for spore counting and making preparations for the identification of spores. Spores were theb observed under compound microscope and documented with a camera and spores identification was conducted based on spore photos and explanation that available in </span><a href="http://www.INVAM.wvu.edu.com"><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">www.INVAM.wvu.edu.com</span></a><span class="font8"> website (INVAM, 2005 ..</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Observation of the structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization of plant roots were conducted through root staining technique. Root segment was cut in a length of 5 cm, and then washed with water. Root sample was introduced into a solution of 10% KOH and heated at 250˚C for 10 minutes in a microwave oven and cooled at room temperature for 24 hours so that the roots will be white in color. KOH solution was then discarded and root samples were washed in running water for 10 minutes. Furthermore, the root samples were stored in a solution of 1% HCl and allowed to stand for one night and then HCl solution discarded. Root samples were then stored in a solution of 0.05% Trypan blue solution and replaced with lacto glycerol for color reduction process (destaining for one day. Then, the root pieces are covered with a cover glass and observed under compound microscope with magnification of 100 times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Variables observed and analyzed in this study are spore morphological characters include shape, color and substanding hyphae. Genus determination was based on the morphological characteristics of each spore. Analysis of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi infection seen through mycorrhizal structures (arbuscule, vesicule, and hyphae in roots after staining.</span></p>
