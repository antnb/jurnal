<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract*</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pan Balang Tamak text is one of famous Balinese texts in Balinese community. However, the popularity of the text has declined since more than years ago especially in the youth. This is because of more interesting and modern entertainment. This phenomenon made the stakeholders feel worried because it led it to get extinct therefore, the stake holders anticipated it. One of the efforts to prevent from the extinct was to write Pan Balang Tamak text. The text was written in some version with their own styles. However, the essence of all variances is similar. The text belongs to be narrative text therefore it needs more abstract comprehension to find the character of the figures, message and ideology of the text. Most of the communities comprehended the text from literal point of view. This was the reason why the text was viewed to have different interpretation about the characters of the text. Besides that, the clauses within the complexes were not comprehended well based on the functions in the clauses complexes. To find the characteristic of the figures of the text, expansion clause becomes prime concern. This paper analyzed the clause functions within the expansion clauses. The data were taken from Satua satua Bali Pan Balang Tamak (2014). The theory used to analyze the data was the theory of clause complex proposed by Halliday. The method hired for this research was library research by syntactical technique. The finding of the research suggested that all kinds of expansion clause be hired in the text such as: elaboration, extension and enhancement. Enhancement clauses were found in the most varieties. Elaboration and expansion in paratactic clauses indicated that Pan Balang Tamak did something different from others did while enhancement clauses in hypotactic indicated that Pan Balang Tamak became target.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">makes the stakeholders feel worried about this situation. Many efforts have been done to make the text keep existing in the community. One of which is to write the spoken text into written text. Some writers rewrite the text with their own language styles such as: structure of the clause, lexical choice, mood system and many others. This effort aims to ease the community to reach and understand the text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The existence of the text is accepted faster by the community from different level of background. The different background of the readers and different versions in language used in the text make different interpretation for the text. Therefore, the text is comprehended differently. The language used in the text plays an important role create certain meaning for the readers. Text is written by Supatra (2014) is the most popular text accepted in the community because the text uses the simplest clause structure hence the text is easy to comprehend. In addition, the text uses certain lexical choices which people are easy to get the point of the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Clauses play an important role in the text because clauses are used to describe chronology of events, the characters of figures and the involvement of the participants. Those identifications are brought through clauses based on their own functions within clause complex. In others word, clause understanding creates internal and external contexts. Internal context refers to context that focuses on language stratum. External context refers to the relationship between language and non-language to create certain meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Unfortunately, the clause functions in the text are not always caught holistically by the communities. Therefore, the semantics of the text is interpreted in some versions. Some communities view that Pan Balang Tamak serving as the main figure in the text has good character, wise, clever, diligent and helpful. Some communities think that Pan Balang Tamak has bad character such as: tricky, selfish, lazy, intolerant and many others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From that phenomenon, this paper analyses the clauses applied based on the functions in the text by using Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) approach. The theory used to analyze the clause functions is clause complex theory proposed by Halliday (2014). The aims of this analysis are to know how far the theory is applied in the text and what kinds of function have significance in determining context of situation.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The research used qualitative research method by describing the result of the research descriptively. The theory used to analyze the data was the theory of expansion clause, a part of clause complex proposed by Halliday (2014). The data source was taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pan Balang Tamak </span><span class="font4">text (Supatra, 2014). Suptra text was chosen because the text written used the simplest clause structures and the most familiar lexes in the text. The concern was viewed to be very important to achieve the readers’ understanding. The original data were written in Balinese language, the data were accompanied with the translation in English. The method was used to take the data is library research (Subroto, 2007) by reading </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pan Balang Tamak</span><span class="font4"> text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All clauses found in the text were collected to become populations, the simple clauses found in the text were ignored since they are not relevant to the analysis. The focus on the analysis was only the clause complexes especially expansions clauses. The technique used to analyze the data was syntactic. The clause complexes were spread into simplex clauses based on the functions they were analyzed by using the theory of clause complex proposed by Halliday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The results of the analysis were presented in description and supported by tables in two languages Balinese and English. Balinese language was placed in the first line as original data and English language was written in the second line as translation language. Each clauses was given code based on the function within the clause complex.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the research, the text of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pan Balang Tamak</span><span class="font4"> applies expansion clauses in each category. The clauses found in the text are presented as bellow:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">4.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elaboration, elaboration clauses were found in the text. The elaboration clauses were found such as repetition, clarification and exemplification.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. Repetition</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">Clause I</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pan Balang Tamak koné jelema &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meawak muané cekak-cekok meplutlutan</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">adané, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cenik,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pan Balang Tamak is his he has small body his face is wrinkle face name</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The name of Pan Balang Tamak is the Theme of the first clause, the second and the third clauses function to elaborate </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pan Balang Tamak’s</span><span class="font4"> characteristics embedded in his body. The second clause uses substation released with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">jelma</span><span class="font4"> which can be interpreted as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font4"> and the third clause uses </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">muane</span><span class="font4"> which is translated into </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">his face.</span><span class="font4"> Pan Balang Tamak is substituted into pronoun in the second clause and possession in the third clauses. In other word, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pan Balang Tamak</span><span class="font4"> is repeated in different ways.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">Clause II</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cetik totonana tuah duén ratu Agung di puri </span><span class="font4">The poison is possessed by the king</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">cetik totonan tunase tekén krama banjaré </span><span class="font4">the poison is asked by the commoners</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">= 2</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">cetik totonan anggona nyetik ia I Pan</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Balang Tamak</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the poison will be used to kill Pan Balang Tamak</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">=3</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Clause II is similar to clause I. The second and the third clauses in the clause II use the lexes </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">cetik</span><span class="font4"> (poison). The words </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">cetik totonan</span><span class="font4"> (that poison) come in the second and the third clause and they function as Theme. Those mean that the writer thinks that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">cetik totonan</span><span class="font4"> is viewed to play an important role in the text. The poison is viewed to be able to kill Pan Balang Tamak.in other word, the function of the second and the third clauses are to emphasis the function of the poison owned by the king released by the first clause.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">Clause III</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kéto pamunyin Pan Balang Tamak &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ane ngaé kliané kapelek makeneh</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That is Pan Balang Tamak said &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which makes the leader blocked</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">α &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= β</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">Clause IV</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kéto dayan Pan Balang Tamak &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ané ngaénang basing gedeg</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That is Pan Balang Tamak’s behaviour &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that makes the communities angry</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">α &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;β</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Clause III is different from clause I and II, clause III has unequal status. The clause III consists of a main and a subordinate clauses. Therefore, it is called hypotactic clause since the second clause functions to elaborate the first clause by emphasizing nominal group </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">pamunyin Pan Balang Tamak.</span><span class="font4"> That nominal group is clarified by adjective clause hence the nominal group has more significant meaning. The existence of the clause complex above guides the reader(s) to comprehend well about what Pan Balang Tamak said. The needed comprehension must be more abstract about whta Pan Balang Tamak already spoke in previous occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Clause III is similar to clause IV, the second clause of the clause IV constructed by relative clause functions to elaborate nominal group </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">dayan Pan Balang Tamak.</span><span class="font4"> The emphasis in the clause III is speech, while in the clause IV is behavior. In other word, the speech and behavior made by Pan Balang Tamak were hated by the communities.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clarification</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Clause V</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lantas Pan Balang Tamak tulungina megat dadiné buung ia kena danda maboros tukadé totonan</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, Pan Balang Tamak is assisted to pass the in other word, he escapes from the river &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fine</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The expansion clause V is the clarification of the first clause. For those who pass the river will escape from the fine. The leader needs the communities to pass the river whether they can pass by themselves or get passed. In this case, Pan Balang Tamak passes the river since one of the commoners gave assistance to pass the river. Therefore, Pan Balang Tamak can be prosecuted to pay fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Clause VI</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cicinge ngengsut ditu di punyan kétkété ané bet tusing nyidang makiba</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The dog is trapped in luxuriant thorn tree &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dog can not move</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The second clause above serves as clarification of the first clause. The dog which is trapped on the luxuriant thorn tree can not move because the thorns stick the dog skin and the dog feels pain so the dog does not want to move to avoid pain. The second clause serves to elaborate the dog condition released by the first clause. The second clause serving as clarification clause plays an important role to give more detail information.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemplification</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Clause VII</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Makejang cicingné pada ada ané maan ada ané maan kékér, lubak, semal, kiuh galak nguber buron alas &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kedis, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tur ané lénan</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">all of the dogs are ready to &nbsp;some of them some of them get wild chicken, weasel,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">pursue preys in the forest &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get birds &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;squirrel and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=3</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first clause is elaborated by two clauses, the two of expansion clauses are parts of what the dogs obtain from hunting. In other word, clauses 2 and 3 are parts of the preys gotten from hunting. In other word, the second clause and the third clauses are example of preys gotten by the dogs during the hunting. Because of those reasons, the second and third clauses are categorized as elaboration clause in paratactic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Clause VIII</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Di arep petiné to lantas jero mangku kairing ngaturang prama suksma antuk tekén para pemedek ngaturang bhakti, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kelédangang Ida Betara mapaica</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in front of jero mangku who is accompanied say thank you because of the God by the prayers do pray, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kindness to bless</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 2</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The first clause suggests the activity be done by jero mangku and the prayers in front of the temple. There are many kinds of activity can be done to say thank you to the God because of his blessing for the community. One of the ways done by the community is by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">prama suksma </span><span class="font4">(ceremony to say tank you with special offering for the God in the temple). The second clause is a form of activity done by jero klian and the prayer to say thank you for the God. The second clause is viewed as one of the examples which can be done to express gratitude to the God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">4.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extension clauses, there are three kind of extension clauses found in the text, namely: adversative, addition and variation.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adversative</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Clause IX</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Makejang anaké mejalan ke alasé &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sakéwala Pan Balang Tamak mejalan sidori</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of the commoners go to forest &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Pan Balang Tamak goes late</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The second clause functions to contrast to the first clause. The second clause is used to describe what Pan Balang Tamak does. The activity done by Pan Balang Tamak is totally different from what the communities do. The second clause plays very important role to value that Pan Balang Tamak does good activity while the community do bad habit. The second clause suggests that only Pan Balang Tamak does something good. The reason why Pan Balang Tamak goes to the forest late because he does not want to hurt animals living in the forest. He thinks that hurting animals is bad behavior, it can destruct natural ecosystem in turn it leads to bad effect for human life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addition</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Clause X</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kéwala Pan Balang Tamak sing ja kodag-kodag baan lengit, tur liu pesan dayané pripitné,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, Pan Balang Tamak is very lazy, considerably &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he has a lot of idea</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The second clause functions to add information about Pan Balang Tamak hence the information about Pan Balang Tamak’s possession is more complete. The second clause has the same status with the first clause so the clause complex is called paratactic. Both of the clauses are the same process in relational processes, but the first clause is attribute and the second clause is possession. The information brought trough the text becomes coherence by the existence of the second clause using conjunction functioning as extension </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tur.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substitution</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Clause XI</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cicingné lantas kaing-kaing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boya ia ngongkong</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The dog cries &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of barking</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The clause XI above belongs to be paratactic clause complex, the first clause functions to state what the dog experiences because of situation that happens to it. The second clause functions to state what the dog should be done in the forest during hunting. The second clause is called substitution because it states what the dog is not doing because of certain situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Clause XII</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sujatiné, ané darae teken Pan Balang Tamak sing ja tain kéwala ento tuah jaja cicing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iwel</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Actually, what Pan Balang Tamak ate is not dog’s feces &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is Iwel cake</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first clause of the clause XI states that Pan Balang Tamak does not do it, it is only trick or strategy to deceive jero klian and the commoners. The second clause functions to state the exact entity eaten by Pan Balang Tamak.

<p><span class="font4">Expansion clauses played an important role to create meaning because chronology of events was described through expansion clauses. There were some expansion clauses functioning to guide the reader(s) to define the character of jero klian, namely hypotactic elaboration such as:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">-</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kéto pamunyin Pan Balang Tamak ane ngaé kliané kapelek makeneh</span><span class="font4"> (that is Pan Balang Tamak’s Speech which make klian trapped)</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">Both clauses above suggested that whatever Pan Balang Tamak did made the communities dislike him very much. The anger to Pan Balang Tamak was released by some efforts to punish him with fine.

<p><span class="font4">The three purpose clauses above suggested that jero klian and the communities have deep anger to Pan Balang Tamak and never forgive him. Therefore, conflict between Pan Balang Tamak and jero klian was found in the community. The conflict was exaggerated by contradictory behavior done by Pan Balang Tamak. The contradiction was released by adversative clauses. The activity done by Pan Balang Tamak was expressed by negation clauses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Based on the research, the text employed three kinds of expansion clauses, namely elaboration, extension and enhancement. Elaboration was used to elaborate nominal group. Paratactic elaboration clause functioned to (i) give repetition about Pan Balang Tamak’s physic, (ii) clarify that Pan Balang Tamak was free from fine and Pan Balang Tamak’s dog can not move from the thorn, and (iii) exemplify the activities done by the communities. In hypotactic clauses were used to elaborate nominal group concerned to Pan Balang Tamak speech and behaviour. The extension clauses were also found such as: adversative (contradictory clause), additional (giving an additional information) and substitution clauses (change into what should not be done). Enhance clause was the most complete varieties found in the text. Such as: reason, purpose, time, place, result, manner and source.</span></p>
