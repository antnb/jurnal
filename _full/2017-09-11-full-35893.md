<p><span class="font3">Aviation and space technology is one of the leading technology for developed countries, especially in the field of rocket technology and charge. Countries that are capable of mastering these technologies will be respected by countries all over the world. Indonesia as the island nation and the State's large and extensive maritime already should have independence in mastering rocket technology and charge, therefore the required continuous efforts to achieve independence, only through the efforts of cultivate the sense of love of aviation technology and space technology, particularly at early stages of the rocket and payload.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In its development of a rocket payload forward the results of this architecture can be a forerunner of the birth of Indonesia satellite and rocket launcher works of Indonesia nation independently. While EDF rockets, especially the control technology, of course on a more sophisticated scale can be developed into the forerunner of Satellite Launcher Rocket. Besides Indonesian”s rocker community (KOMURINDO) also can increase the sense of unity about the importance of maintaining the dignity and sovereignty of the Indonesian aerospace through the mastery of aviation and space technology, especially rockets and cargo. In</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">addition, it can also shorten the distance difference of flight science and space technology and can expand its spread among universities across Indonesia Method</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this research, there are several stages that are done from the beginning of the study until the end of the study. The first stage is checked or check out the equipment used, the tools used must comply with the existing problems, namely can make a rocket payload (pay-load) Graphic Monitoring Test Rocket Launch Payload Attitude to find out directions from the plan of direction from the payload .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Other support tools also prepared i.e. by installing some software such as the Arduino IDE and application of ground station. The second piece of software that will be used to create programs that will run on sensor Accelerometer ADXL345, henceforth will be visualized in the form of graphs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Arduino IDE is useful of the Arduino software as the compiler for the Arduino microcontroller type using C language for programming. On the Arduino IDE software for this program will be created that contains instructions that will be executed by the Arduino microcontroller. Program that will be created will arrange communication between Arduino with Accelerometer ADXL345 using the I2C communication as well as setting work on the accelerometer ADXL345. In a program that made this microcontroller will only read the data axis acceleration x, y and z from the measurements performed by the accelerometer ADXL345 and further the acceleration results data will be sent to your computer. This is done by way of making the microcontroller just read the output to address acceleration axes x, y and z on the accelerometer ADXL345.
