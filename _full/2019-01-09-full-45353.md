Fresh goats milk has more complete nutrition and some bioactive components that play a role in maintaining body health but leng storage at room temperature will affect the nutritional content and level of food safety An important aspect in assessing milk quality is physical chemistry and microbiological properties therefore this study aims to determine the physical chemistry and microbiological milk of Etawah Crossbreeds goats during storage at room temperature The study was conducted from 29 June to 2 August 2018 The milk used in this study was Etawah Cros"
