<p><span class="font3">This study aims at exploring the application of conceptual metaphors in the parable texts found in the Gospel of Luke and various strategies applied in the translation of conceptual metaphors from English into Bahasa Indonesia. The research utilizes qualitative method in the form of text analysis to analyze the translation product based on a parallel corpus derived from the English version of the New Living Translation Bible published in 2008 by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lembaga Alkitab Indonesia</span><span class="font3"> and its translation into </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bahasa Indonesia</span><span class="font3">. Metaphorical expressions in sub-corpus were identified using data reduction technique in the form of parable texts found in the Gospel of Luke, which were collected, selected, simplified and abstracted. The findings emerged from this study. Firstly, from the conceptual mapping all three categories of conceptual metaphor were discovered including orientational metaphor, ontological metaphors, and structural metaphor. Secondly, to overcome the problems of translating conceptual metaphors, the translators applied methods closely oriented towards target language (TL) based on a number of conceptual metaphors translation procedures. Translation techniques employed include the communicative translation method.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Introduction</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">In translation studies, translation is seen as both a process and a product (Hatim and Mason, 1990:3-4). As a product, translation can be seen as the result or outcome of translating certain text from source language (SL) into target language (TL). Furthermore, the current study aims to explore the product of parable translation found in the Gospel of Luke from English into Indonesian. The aspects being researched are the research outcome (objective aspect) and the effects on the target readers (affective aspect).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The choice of research object in this study, as the basis for research on the manifestation of conceptual metaphor in the parable texts found in the Gospel of Luke, is made firstly because the parables in the Gospel of Luke illustrate the various aspects and reality of daily lives in the time of Jesus Christ that are still relevant today. The parable texts mentioned make up the core of Christ’s teachings (i.e., the principles of truth in Christianity) with their inherent cultural richness, which requires interpretation in the reading of the passages. Parables as texts consist of signification and interpretation systems that must be done on the signs or realities that occurred in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The manifestation of metaphor can be traced through language or metaphorical expressions used to communicate based on the same conceptual system, at least within one language system. Several experts on culture argue that metaphors through conceptual mapping is universal (Newmark, 1988; Schäffner, 2004; Kὂvecses, 2005), and can be found across languages and cultures. However, each culture has specific conceptual mapping (Lakoff, 1992:40, 1993:245). For example, in concept of ‘The Kingdom of Heaven’ (Luke 13:18) in English is expressed through conceptual mapping (henceforth called CM): </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">KINGDOM OF GOD IS A MUSTARDSEED</span><span class="font3">, as in the sentence ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom of God is like a mustard seed.ʼ</span><span class="font3"> This concept in Indonesian is also presented in the same metaphorical expression with the Source Text (henceforth called ST), which is “</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kerajaan Allah”</span><span class="font3"> as in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Vol. 10. Na. 2 July 2016</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Accreditation:--</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">sentence ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kerajaan Allah seumpama biji sesawi.ʼ</span><span class="font3">The difference of CM in SL and CM in TL is in the form of metaphorical expression used to convey the same concept (Kὂvecses, 2002).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Theoretical Background</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The essence of metaphor is how readers can comprehend and experience (based on first-hand encounters) a thing or a concept through another concept, as suggested by the following quote: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“the essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another”</span><span class="font3"> (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980:5). This quote implies that metaphor is one way for readers to understand one domain of experience (SD) through another domain of experience that is more easily understood or more readily familiar (TD). In other words, metaphor is an inter-domain relation in human conceptual system (Lakoff, 1993:203).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Translation theories, particularly the one developed by Newmark (1988) and Larson (1998) are used to analyze the second question in this research. The theory of metaphor translation developed by Newmark (1988), supported by related theory by Larson (1998), is used to analyze the questions in this study, which includes: (1) procedure, (2) technique, and (3) method in the translation of metaphors.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Methodology</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The method used in this research is the qualitative method in the form of textual analysis, comparative analysis based on a comparative model focusing on types of metaphors from the three categories of conceptual metaphors (orientational, ontological, and structural) in the parable texts from the Gospel of Luke when translated from English into Indonesian. The qualitative research is supported by cognitive approach (as stated by Lakoff and Johnson, 1980), which is a cognitive linguistic approach, particularly in the domain of lexical semantics that applies to conceptual metaphor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This study is also a corpus-based research, involving a list of keywords that became the initial data from concordance and from the examples on the use of metaphorical 88</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">expressions in various contexts in the form of sentences or paragraph, identified and then interpreted. The significance attained from this method is the ability to compare ST sub corpus in the Gospel of Luke, as the main sub corpus being research, with the sub corpus found in the Gospels of Matthew and Mark (as comparative corpus).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Orientational metaphor is one category of conceptual metaphor that refers to the spatial concept, explicating the spatial range of an abstract knowledge with relatable, real human experience. Examples include: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">UP-DOWN, IN-OUT, FRONT-BACK, ON-OFF, DEEP-SHALLOW, CENTRAL-PERIPHERAL</span><span class="font3"> (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980:14). Metaphors in the following data are considered to have the orientation of social status because the verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ʻstandʼ</span><span class="font3"> in SD is a metaphoric expression that can be interpreted through CM as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Pharisee </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">stood </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">and prayed thus with himself, “God, I thank You that I am not like other men-extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess</span><span class="font3">”. (Luke 18:1112)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">b. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">And the tax collector, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">standing afar off</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">, would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, “God be merciful to me a sinner!” </span><span class="font3">(Luke 18:13)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In data (1a), the verb ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stood</span><span class="font3">’ is the past form of the verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ʻstandʼ</span><span class="font3">, which is in the form of an informative verb. This verb is an abstract entity from the perspective of cognitive linguistics that partly forms the symbolic system in Christianity, which is ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">exalt</span><span class="font3">’ as SD, as a metaphysic concept used to define ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">exalt</span><span class="font3">’ (Neville, 2001). The concept of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ʻstandʼ</span><span class="font3"> that is conceptualized into ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">exalt</span><span class="font3">’ as SD can be mapped through CM: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">EXALT IS DOWN</span><span class="font3">. It can be inferred that the verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ʻstandʼ,</span><span class="font3"> which denotatively contains the literal meaning of ‘getting up’ or ‘looking up’, in conceptual metaphor is analogous to ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">exalt</span><span class="font3">’ (putting oneself in a higher position).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Metaphorical coherence in the source domain of the metaphor itself is taken from daily lives as a symbolic system that refers to the reality of life, which refers to the Pharisee as a group of Jews that maintained and held on to strict religious traditions at the time. However, aside from strong religious tendencies, they became arrogant and stressed on overt formality that often resulted into ignoring basic principles of morality that is seen as more humane than strict adherence to religious rules (Hillyer, 1999:299-300). This is seen in the parable from Luke 18:11-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The conceptual mapping </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">EXALT IS DOWN</span><span class="font3"> is based on the characteristics that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">EXALT</span><span class="font3"> has similar characteristics possessed by the Pharisees, which is to place themselves at a higher position </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(EXALT)</span><span class="font3"> in the target domain. Conceptual correspondence is shown because of the similar characteristics between the mental domain of the source and the target can be explained by the expression ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stood</span><span class="font3">’, which has the literal meaning of ‘getting up’or ‘looking up’, conceptualized to be analogous with ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">exalt</span><span class="font3">’ to become a metaphor. With the expression ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stood</span><span class="font3">’, it can be inferred that the writer conceptualized ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stood</span><span class="font3">’ as having similar characteristics with ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">exalt</span><span class="font3">’ (praising oneself) through the expression, “</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I am not like other men-extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.”</span><span class="font3"> These expressions are clearly expressions of self-adornment and undermining of others (tax collectors).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In data (1b), the adverbial phrase ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">standing afar offʼ</span><span class="font3"> as SD, which forms a verbal phrase, is an abstract entity from the perspective of cognitive linguistics that produce the TD ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">humble</span><span class="font3">’ (to lower oneself). The meaning created from this abstract entity, which partly forms the symbolic system of ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">humble</span><span class="font3">’ in Christianity as TD, is a metaphysical concept used to define ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">humble</span><span class="font3">’ (Neville, 2001). The concept ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">standing afar offʼ</span><span class="font3"> when conceptualized into ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">humble</span><span class="font3">’ as TD can be mapped through CM: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">HUMBLE IS UP</span><span class="font3">. In other words, the adverbial phrase ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">standing afar offʼ</span><span class="font3"> in terms of conceptual metaphor is analogous with ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">humble</span><span class="font3">’ (to lower oneself).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Metaphorical coherence in the source domain of the metaphor itself is taken from</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(Jews) who collected taxes and retribution for Romans as at that time the Jewish territory were colonized by the Romans. Then, the Jews worked for their colonizers. The tasks of tax collectors included gathering and collecting tithes and various direct taxes. From the beginning, they had the tendency to extort and misuse the tax revenues. From the implicit confession of Zacchaeus (Luke 19:8), tax collectors were considered sinners (Hillyer, 1999:285-286). The parable found in Luke 18:11-13 refers to this concept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the conceptual mapping of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">HUMBLE IS UP</span><span class="font3">, it can be seen that the verbal phrase ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">standing afar offʼ</span><span class="font3"> as an abstraction in SD is portrayed as or analogous to lowering oneself </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(HUMBLE)</span><span class="font2">. </span><span class="font3">Thus similar characteristics possessed by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">HUMBLE</span><span class="font3"> are also possessed by the tax collectors who lowered themselves as the target domain. The similarities or characteristics in the two components of meaning become the basis of metaphor, in which the tax collector who stood afar off and positioning himself lower will be elevated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Conceptual correspondence is shown due to similar characteristics between the mental domain of source and target, explained through the expression ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">standing afar off</span><span class="font3">’, which literally means standing at a distance from something can be equated with ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">humble</span><span class="font3">’ as a metaphor. With the expression of ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">standing afar off</span><span class="font3">’, it can be inferred that the writer conceptualized ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">standing afar off</span><span class="font3">’ as having similar characteristics with ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">humble</span><span class="font3">’ (to lower oneself). In the text, it is clear that lowering oneself is the concept being presented, through the expression, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“[he] would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ʻGod, be merciful to me, sinner that I amʼ.</span><span class="font3">” These expressions are clearly the expression of someone who is placing himself at a lower position.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Ontological metaphor represents the effort to explain abstract concepts and human knowledge such as events, activities, emotions, and ideas—manifested in words and sentences that refer to objects and physical substances that are physically clear and real.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Ontological metaphor conceptualizes thoughts, experiences, and process or other abstractions into something with physical characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Metaphor in data (2) is considered ontological metaphor because ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a garment</span><span class="font3">’ as SD takes the form of metaphoric expression. This portion of the research is focused on the interpretation of meaning and signification form the story (parable).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one puts a piece from a new </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">garment </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">on an old </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">; otherwise </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the new makes a tear</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">, and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old.</span><span class="font3"> (Lukas 5:36)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The noun ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a garment</span><span class="font3">’ as SD in this sentence is an abstract container from the perspective of cognitive linguistics, proven by the presence of the adverb ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">onʼ</span><span class="font3"> in the phrase ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">an old one</span><span class="font3">’ presented through conceptual metaphor that is more concrete and easier to understand. In other words, the container can be mapped through CM to become ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a garment</span><span class="font3">’ is ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tenet</span><span class="font3">’ as TD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The meaning created from the abstract container that partly forms the symbolic system in Christianity is ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tenet</span><span class="font3">’ in TD, as a metaphysical concept used to define ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tenet</span><span class="font3">’ (Neville, 2001). The concept ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a garment</span><span class="font3">’ conceptualized as ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tenet</span><span class="font3">’ can be mapped through CM: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">TENET IS GARMENT</span><span class="font3">. In other words, ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a garment</span><span class="font3">’ that refers to a piece of fabric, in conceptual metaphor is analogous to ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tenet</span><span class="font3">’ (teaching). The metaphorical coherence in the source domain of the metaphor itself is taken from daily conversational language as a symbolic system that refers to the reality of life. From the metaphor </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">TENET IS GARMENT, </span><span class="font3">it can be understood that ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">garment</span><span class="font3">’ in an abstraction in SD analogous to teaching (‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tenet</span><span class="font3">’) so that the meaning in the metaphor can be more clearly understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The presence of ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">garment</span><span class="font3">’ can be constructed essentially in two ways: firstly as thought and action, and secondly in the sense of a process, an event, or a result of a process. As a process, “</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">no one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it into an old garment. If he does, he will have torn the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old</span><span class="font3">” (Luke 5:37). From this process, it is clear that there is an analogy that exists between ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">garment</span><span class="font3">’ as SD and ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tenet</span><span class="font3">’ as TD, and between ‘fabric’ or ‘cloth’ and ‘teaching’.

<p><span class="font3">Structural metaphor is a type of metaphor in which the entirety of its complex mental concept is structured in a group of concrete terminologies and concepts. Structural metaphor is based on two domains: source domain and target domain, grounded in systematic correlation from daily experience. Lakoff and Johnson (2003:5) stressed that structural conceptual metaphor is dynamic because it manifests the current thoughts, emotions, and actions of the users, which always change according to the different thoughts, emotions, and actions in each culture. This type of metaphor typically uses a wide range of individual linguistic expressions.</span></p>

The interpretation of meaning and the signification of data (3) form the parable, which is ‘the living/watchful faith’ as a symbol is explained by conceptual mapping (CM).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The verbal phrase ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lamps burning</span><span class="font3">’ in data (3) as SD is an abstract entity from the perspective of cognitive linguistics, which in terms of conceptual metaphor went through CM to be mapped into a concrete entity for an ideal TD.

In other words, ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lamps burning</span><span class="font3">’ is truly ‘a light that continuously shines’ and according to conceptual metaphor is analogous to ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">faith of life</span><span class="font3">’ (living faith). The clause ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">waist be girded</span><span class="font3">’ as SD is also an abstract entity from the perspective of cognitive linguistics, which can be conceptually mapped as ‘be ready to serve’ so that it can produce a meaningful product for TD.

Therefore, when a servant was working or serving his master, the bottom end of his clothing would have been tied onto a belt so that the end of the fabric would not hinder his movements while working (Reilling, Swellengrebel, 2005: 432). From this coherence, emerged a verse that reads, “Keep your belts fastened and your lamps burning” (Luke 12:35). At the time a lamp in Palestine was made out of clay with olive oil as the fuel to make illumination. The conceptual mapping </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">FAITH OF LIFE IS WAKEFUL</span><span class="font3"> can provide an understanding ‘the light that keeps on illuminating’ as SD that is portrayed as an abstraction, because it can be compared to ‘the living faith’ based on the similar characteristics between ‘the light that keeps on illuminating’ and the characteristics of ‘the living faith’ as TD. The similar characteristics found in the two components of meaning become the basis for the metaphor ‘the lamps that keep on burning’, referred to in this parable because the oil as the fuel in the lamps flows through a wick, to keep the lamp burning the wick is the part that is lit (Throntveit, 2012: 223-224). Similarly, in the expression ‘the waist that is continuously tied’ means always ready to serve or to work. The analogy here is the behavior that is always ready to serve, which is a direct reflection of the living faith.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Analysis was performed on the translation strategy of container/containment metaphor as a subcategory of ontological metaphor, which refers to the metaphor used to express abstract concepts such as ideas, emotion, and activities as something concrete, like an object, a substance, a container, or a person. In the following data, abstract ideas are transformed as concrete objects.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">From the perspective of translation procedure for metaphor, the metaphor in ST is translated into a metaphoric form in TT, referring to the translation of the metaphoric expression as a realization of CM: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A MAN IS LAMB</span><span class="font3"> because ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lamb</span><span class="font3">’ is analogous with ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">man</span><span class="font3">’, whereas </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lamb</span><span class="font3"> in this context functions as an object.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the translation of ST that contains the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lamb</span><span class="font3"> metaphor, the translator used one translation procedure and two translation techniques. From the aspect of translation procedure for metaphor, the metaphor in ST is translated into metaphoric form in TT with the same SD (image), which is ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lamb</span><span class="font3">’, and as SD interpreted as ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">man</span><span class="font3">’ in TD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the metaphor found in the data, a grammatical form that represents two proposition in a semantic structure that codes situational proposition is presented. The core concept of the proposition is the situation represented by the noun ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lambs</span><span class="font3">’. A proposition consists of a topic and an image of that topic. That sentence contains a topic—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lamb</span><span class="font3">; an image—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">followers of God</span><span class="font3">; point of similarity—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">men sent among this world;</span><span class="font3"> and nonfigurative meaning—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">followers of God sent into the midst of this world full of danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two translation techniques applied by the translator in translating the data: first, ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lamb among wolvesʼ</span><span class="font3"> is translated into</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ʻdomba di antara serigalaʼ</span><span class="font3">, in which the translator applied </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shift</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">transposition</span><span class="font3"> translation technique, which indicates a change in language norms from SL to TL. The translator applied the transposition technique by eliminating the marker ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span class="font3">’ to signify plural noun in SL, which is not translated but rather eliminated from the plural ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lambs</span><span class="font3">’ into the singular ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">domba</span><span class="font3">’ and from ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wolvesʼ</span><span class="font3"> into ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">serigala</span><span class="font3">’, although the transfer process did not change the meaning in the message of the text. By translating the terminology ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lambs among wolvesʼ</span><span class="font3"> (SL) into ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">domba di antara serigala</span><span class="font3">’ (TL), the translator expressed that terminology naturally and adjusted it with the language structure of the target audience. The translator applied transposition translation technique by not translating the marker ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span class="font3">’, which is a marker for plural nouns in SL. It can be said that the translator is 95</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Vol. 10. Na. 2 July 2016</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Accreditation:--</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">oriented towards TL, in which it is common that the plural marker is not always used, with the objective that the translation product is readable and can be accepted among the readers of TL.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Second, the translator applied a translation technique called modulation, which refers to the shift in point of view in translating ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sendʼ</span><span class="font3"> into‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mengutus</span><span class="font3">’. The verb ‘to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sendʼ</span><span class="font3"> in ancient Greek is ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">apostelloʼ</span><span class="font3">, which means ‘to give an order to be carried out.’ This word also refers to an activity that is currently or about to be performed. The word ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">apostello</span><span class="font3">’ is a present indicative active word. ‘Present’ means that the activity is currently or continuously being done, while ‘indicative’ refers to an activity being performed. In this case, TL accurately translated the verb ‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sendʼ</span><span class="font3"> into‘</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mengutus</span><span class="font3">’. It seems as if the translator referred more into the original language (Koine Greek) in translating this verb so that the message of the text gets to the target readers in accordance to the meaning intended by the author in the original language.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Translation Methods of Conceptual Metaphor</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The method chosen by the translator in translating parable texts from the Gospel of Luke is communicative and adaptive methods because these texts belong to a special category, i.e., informative text, which emphasizes the accuracy of meaning, message, and intention contained in ST. The parable texts also belong the category of imperative text (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">vocative</span><span class="font3"> text), aiming to influence the readers to do something, and expressive text, emphasizing the expression of the author’s emotion. Aside from literal and faithful translation methods, as well as semantic method through the application of literal, transposition, addition of lexical elements (linguistic amplification), and transference techniques oriented more towards SL, the author also applied the method of communicative translation, referring to a translation strategy that is oriented more towards TL-even though the use is less frequent compared to literal and transposition translation methods. This is 96</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">proven by the application of literal technique, transposition technique, and the technique involving addition of lexical elements. Based on the application of the translation techniques for conceptual metaphor from ST into TT, several translation techniques were found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another translation phenomenon is that the translator applied descriptive equivalence technique in addition to modulation, adaptation, literal, and the addition of lexical elements as the strategy of translating metaphors from ST into TT. This indicates that the translator also emphasized readability for the target audience. Analysis shows that transposition as one translation technique oriented towards TL is sufficiently effective in the translation of parable texts from the Gospel of Luke. The application of translation procedure and translation method based on the emergence of their use is relevant for the religious language genre as one form of text that has informative function, i.e., to deliver the information and understanding of the truth principles according to Christianity based on to the realities of life at the time of Jesus Christ that is still relevant with the realities of today.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Understanding the meaning of metaphoric expressions through cognitive perspective, as performed in this research, strengthens the theory of metaphors, which in this case can enlighten how metaphors in various types of texts can be researched. This study stresses on the four functions of conceptual metaphor in the parables from the Gospel of Luke (ST) and its translation into Indonesia (TT). In religious texts, conceptual metaphor does not stand alone within a context, but rather it appears in conjunction with other SD components, because the construct of the language that follows conceptual metaphor within a paragraph in ST also confound the translation efforts. Therefore, translators may apply several alternatives of translation techniques, as described in the above mentioned application of procedures and methods for translating conceptual metaphor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The translation procedure related to the second research question is often applied by the translators of the Gospel of Luke, which is the procedure of translating metaphors from ST into a metaphoric form in TT while maintaining the same SD (image). In other words, SD (image) in TT is the same with SD (image) in ST, rendering that the nuance of SL is more prominent. This empirical finding strengthens translation strategies, particularly translation procedures proposed by Larson (1984), Newmark (1988) including the factor of translatability, which eases the translation process of conceptual metaphor. Translation strategies that cover a wide range of techniques, procedures, methods, and ideology reflect the true nature of effort taken by the translator to translate conceptual metaphor found in ST from the level of macro text down to the level of micro text. The current research strengthen the various alternative procedures on the translation of metaphors suggested by several experts in metaphor, such as Larson (1984), and Newmark (1988), although there are many similarities between these procedures. This study synthesizes the translation procedures with Lakoff’s theory of conceptual metaphor (1993), which emphasizes conceptual mapping that refers to the ontological relations between SD and TD—in earlier approaches more commonly known as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">imag</span><span class="font3">e.</span></p>
