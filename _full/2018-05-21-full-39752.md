The research was coducted at Laboratory of Biotechnology Faculty of Agriculture Udayana University The purpose of this research were to investigate moleculer detection of CVPD pathogen in its vector other phytophagous insects on citrus cv Siam and kemuning Murraya paniculata L Jack The result of this research showed that adults and nymphs of Diaphorina citri Kuw could transmit CVPD disease but the pathogen of CVPD could not be transovarially transmited A
