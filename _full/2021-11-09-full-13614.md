<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">P</span><span class="font7">lants are challenged by numerous pathogens throughout their life cycles and yet are able to fend off most infections. The native resistance of most plant species against a wide variety of pathogens is known as nonhost resistance (NHR), which confers durable protection to plant species. Recognition of nonself is the key to the activation of innate defense mechanisms in plants in response to microbial attacks. The innate defense system depends on the detection of microbial elicitors that induces a cascade of defense responses that may include MAP kinase activity, the up-regulation of antimicrobial compounds, elicitation of inflammatory responses, the production of cytokines or mucins, apoptosis, nitric oxidemediated responses, and the transcription of defense related genes (Chisholm </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">, 2006;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Medzhitov, 2007; Schwessinger and Zipfel, 2008).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The most notorious oomycetes are </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Phytophthora</span><span class="font7"> species, arguably the most devastating pathogens of dicot plants (Kamoun, 2003). </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Phytophthora infestans</span><span class="font7"> causes late blight, a devastating disease that results in multibilliondollar losses in potato and tomato production (Garelik, 2002; Smart and Fry, 2001). Most plants, such as weeds and various crops, are resistant to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. infestans</span><span class="font7">, and grow unimpaired in or next to fields with a high incidence of late blight (Kamoun </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 1999). Understanding the molecular basis of non-host resistance to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. infestans</span><span class="font7"> will provide insight into a key molecular process and will offer novel perspectives for engineering durable late blight resistance in crop plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Species-specific elicitors have been described in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. infestans</span><span class="font7"> and other </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Phytophthora </span><span class="font7">species and can trigger defense responses in non-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">host plants. An extracellular transglutaminase that is conserved in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. infestans</span><span class="font7"> and other </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Phytophthora</span><span class="font7"> species induces defense responses in the non-host parsley (Brunner </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 2002; Nurnberger and Brunner, 2002). </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Arabidopsis thaliana</span><span class="font7"> has emerged as a valuable model to study NHR in plants (Holub and Cooper</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font7"> 2004; Yun </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font7"> 2003). A series of penetration mutants were identified in the model plant </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7">, allowing considerable progress towards understanding NHR. Huitema </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">. (2003) reported that active defense responses associated with non-host resistance of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> to the oomycete pathogen </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. infestans</span><span class="font7">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Several plant defense responses are induced during the NHR response. Many defense responses are similar to those induced during gene-for-gene or host resistance. A rapid and transient production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), termed 'oxidative burst' is a hallmark of successful recognition of plant pathogens and the oxidative burst could have a direct effect on pathogen or the defenses caused in plant because of its reactivity (Torres</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font7"> 2010). ROS are produced during both gene-for gene and NHR, even though the timing and amount might slightly vary between the two (Huckelhoven, 2001, Able </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font7"> 2003).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ROS also associated with the hypersensitive reaction (HR), a localized response at the site of pathogen attack that displays programmed cell death and that could contribute to limit the spread of the pathogens or be a source of signals for establishment of further defenses (Mur </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">, </span><span class="font7">2008). HR is associated with both host and nonhost resistance to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. infestans</span><span class="font7"> (Vleeshouwers, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font7"> 2000). HR occurs at the infection site with apoptosis-like features. Despite controversial debate as to the role of ROS in the plant HR, they are generally regarded as causes of hypersensitive cell death (Delledonne </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 2001, Torres </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al., </span><span class="font7">2005).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this study, we used methanol extract of mycelia (MEM) from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. infestans</span><span class="font7"> for the study of induced resistant reactions in non-host model plant </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">MATERIALS AND METHODS</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Plant materials</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) plants were grown at 23Â°C and 70% humidity under a 16 h photoperiod and a 8 h dark period in environmentally controlled growth cabinets and 3-4 weeks old leaves were used for the experiments. For the study of plant growth, seeds were surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed in water, and placed at 4Â°C for 3-4 days in darkness. Seeds were then plated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) media supplemented with 3% sucrose and solidified with 0.1% Phytagel. MEM elicitor was dissolved in water by adding 3% DMSO and was added separately into the medium and mixed well before gelation. Seeds were plated on medium containing MEM elicitor (or control medium) and effects assayed 6 days later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Pathogenic isolate </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Phytophthora infestans</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pathogenic isolate [</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Phytophthora infestans</span><span class="font7"> (Mont.) De Bary], race 1.2.3.4 was used to culture for mycelia collection and were maintained at Plant Pathology laboratory of the Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University. The fungi used as inocula for liquid culture were grown on rye-seed extract agar medium in a test tube at 18Â°C in the dark condition for 2 weeks. Parts of the growing mycelia were placed in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 20 ml of rye liquid nutrient medium of rye seed-extract (60 g rye seed), 20 g of sucrose and 2 g of yeast extract per 1 liter of distilled water and incubated in dark condition for 2 weeks at 18Â°C to allow growth of the mycelia. The mycelial mats grown in the liquid medium were washed thoroughly with running tap water on a mesh (3 Ã 3 mm) to remove the growth medium and zoosporangia and finally washed with distilled water. To remove excess water, water was filtered through filter paper (Toyoroshi No. 2) under reduced pressure and then frozen at -20Â°C for preparation of MEM elicitor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The collected mycelia of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. infestans</span><span class="font7"> were frozen with liquid nitrogen. The frozen mycelia were ground by a mortar and pestle under a freezing temperature using liquid nitrogen. The ground mycelia were transferred to falcon tube (50 ml) containing methanol at the rate of 10 ml of methanol per 1 g mycelia. The mycelia suspension were finely ground using a polytron type homogenizer (HG30, Hitachi Koki, Japan) for 2 min. After centrifugation at 4Â°C, 3000 Ã g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected and dried by using an evaporator, and was used as MEM elicitor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The relative intensity ofROS generationwas measured bycountingphotonsfrom L-012 (Waku, Osaka, Japan)-mediated chemiluminescence. In </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> leaves, ROS measurement was done as described by Kobayashi </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">. (2007) with little modification. For the detection of ROS production in leaf tissues, 0.5 mM L-012 in 10 mM MOPS-KOH (pH 7.4) was used to infiltrate in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Arabidopsis</span><span class="font7"> leaves via a syringe without needle. Chemiluminescencewasmonitoredcontinuously using a photon image processor equipped with a sensitive CCD camera in the dark chamber at 20Â°C (Aquacosmos 2.5; Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) and quantified using the U7501 program (Hamamatsu Photonics).</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Detection of cell death</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">To detect cell death on the plant, elicitors were infiltrated by using a syringe without needle from opposite surface of the leaves. Cell death was measured by an electrolyte leakage method, which was adapted from the method described by Yeom </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">. (2011). Leaves were infiltrated by elicitors under the leaf surface, and leaf discs (1 cm in diameter) were collected from the leaf 12, 24 and 48 h after treatment. Seven leaf discs were floated on 7 ml of distilled water for 2 h at room temperature and electrical conductivity was measured using a conductivity meter (Horiba, Kyoto, Japan).</span></p>

(2003) with a minor modification. Briefly, infected leaves were cleared in methanol overnight, and then the cleared tissue was boiled for 2 min in lactophenol trypan blue stain (10 ml H<sub>2</sub>O, 10 ml lactic acid, 10 ml glycerol, 10 g phenol, and 10 mg trypan blue). After the leaves had been allowed to cool at room temperature for 1 h, the stain was replaced with 1 g/m1 chloral hydrate. Stained leaves were monitored using an Olympus microscope BX51 (Olympus).</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>O<sub>2</sub>Â¯ producing activity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">MEM elicitor contains relatively low molecular weight compounds because of limited solubility of high molecular weight compounds or protein in methanol. The oxidative burst (rapid and transient production of O<sub>2</sub>Â¯) in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana </span><span class="font7">plant was detected after MEM elicitor treatment. MEM was infiltrated into </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> leaves at the concentration of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 or 1 mg/ml and incubated for 24 h. O<sub>2</sub>Â¯ producing activity was measured by using O<sub>2</sub>Â¯ unique luminous reagent L-012 (Fig. 1). MEM is a high O<sub>2</sub>Â¯ producing elicitor with dose dependent nature (Fig. 1A and B). Three % DMSO was used as a negative control because MEM elicitor was dissolved in 3% DMSO. Thus, MEM elicitor induced O<sub>2</sub>Â¯ generation in non-host </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> as an early response and recognition of elicitor by plant.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Induction of cell death</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">HR-like cell death was examined in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> leaves. Ion leakage has been observed as an indicator of plant cell death (Rizhsky </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font7"> 2002). In this experiment, average-sized </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> leaves (21 days after germination) were selected and infiltrated by MEM elicitors by using</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">syringe without needle from lower surface of the leaves. Leaf discs collected from treated leaves were floated on distilled water and shaken for 2 h at room temperature. Higher degree of ion leakage was detected in MEM elicitor-treated leaves after 12, 24 and 48 h compared to DMSO-treated leaves (Fig. 2A). The interaction between MEM elicitor and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> was examined using light microscopy after staining with lactophenol trypan blue of inoculated leaves because staining of plant cells with trypan blue is indicative of cell death. The densely stained epidermal and mesophyll cells were observed in the MEM treated leaves from 3 days after inoculation (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, no stained areas were developed in DMSO treated </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> leaves. These results confirm that MEM causes cell death in non-host </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> plant.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Root growth is arrested in response to MEM elicitor</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">To study the effects of MEM elicitor on root growth, we germinated seeds in the presence of the MEM elicitor and examined the effects on the roots after 6 days. Inhibition of growth of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> seedlings treated with MEM elicitor was observed (Fig. 3A). Retardation of plant growth was apparent irrespective to seedling biomass and root growth (Fig. 3B and C). Thus, it was indicated that the treatment with MEM elicitor sensitized the plant which causes internal changes, and consequently root growth was markedly retarded.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Expression of defense-related genes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">To investigate whether the defense-related genes are induced by MEM elicitor, total RNAs from MEM-treated </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> leaves were extracted and were analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig. 4). We checked salicylic acid associated defense gene </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">PR</span><span class="font7"> (pathogenesis-related protein) namely </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">AtPR1</span><span class="font7">, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">AtPR2, AtPR3, AtPR4 and AtPR5.</span><span class="font7"> High expression of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">AtPR1</span><span class="font7">, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">AtPR2, AtPR4</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">AtPR5 </span><span class="font7">genes was found by MEM elicitor treatment.

Expression of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">StrbohF</span><span class="font7"> gene was observed in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana.</span><span class="font7"> Therefore, MEM-induced gene expression of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">AtrbohF</span><span class="font7"> and PR gene series, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">AtPR1</span><span class="font7">, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">AtPR2, AtPR4</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">AtPR5</span><span class="font7">, are involved in non-host defense response in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the most rapid defense reactions to pathogen attack is the so-called oxidative burst, which constitutes the production of O<sub>2</sub>Â¯ at the site of attempted invasion (Apostol </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 1989). In the present study, it was shown that MEM elicitor from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. infestans</span><span class="font7"> induced O<sub>2</sub>Â¯ production in non-host </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> (Fig. 1). The involvement of ROS in non-host response has been found in various plant-pathogen systems (Wen </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">, </span><span class="font7">2011, HÃ¼ckelhoven and Kogel, 2003, Nimchuk </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 2003). ROS are produced during both gene-for gene and nonhost resistance, even though the timing and amount might slightly vary between the two (Huckelhoven, 2001, Able </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font7"> 2003). These results, in conjunction with the present</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">study, provide evidences that MEM elicitor from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. infestans</span><span class="font7"> induced ROS in non-host </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7">-elicitor or -pathogen system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An elicitor can be recognized by the plant surveillance system and a defense reaction leading to HR will be activated (Mysore and Ryu, 2004). MEM elicitor induced HR in nonhost </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. thaliana</span><span class="font7"> (Fig. 2). Chloroplast-generated ROS play a major role in localized cell death during the non-host interaction between tobacco and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Xanthomonas campestris</span><span class="font7"> pv. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">vesicatoria </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">(</span><span class="font7">Zurbriggen </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font7"> 2009). Several lines of evidence from various plant species suggest that the sources of ROS are different during non-host response and during the HR, but these sources may interact with each other (Bindschedler </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">, </span><span class="font7">2006, Soylu </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7">, 2005, Torres </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 2005). These results indicate that both host and non-host specific interactions can provide similar kind of HR response even though the reduced degree of response appears in non-host interaction.</span></p>
