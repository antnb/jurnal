Abstrak  In this research a carbon dot has been synthesized using citric acid and polyethylene by heating repeatedly in the microwave The results of the synthesis were characterized by UVVis FTIR Photoluminescence PL and TRPL spectroscopy The UVVis characterizations show that the sample has shown two peaks with the wavelength 200280 nm and 330 nm This marks the pp and np excitation transitions which are characteristic of the carbon dot FTIR charac
