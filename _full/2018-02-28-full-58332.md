Lodging is one of the main needs for tourists visiting Bali, the type of lodging is distinguished from large-scale ones such as hotels to small-scale ones such as homestays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Homestay is an ordinary house that has rooms for rent to tourists who need lodging for some time and they live in the same house with their owners. Homestay owners generally do not provide other facilities besides bedrooms and equipment. Tourists who stay at the homestay are mostly</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">backpackers or tourists who travel with a limited budget but are also not closed to tourists who are bored with the atmosphere of the hotel, because homestays have a sense of family because they live together with their owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sanur as a tourist destination certainly has many homestays, the development of homestays in the Sanur area is getting higher because the surrounding community is aware of the opportunities that exist. Can be seen along the main roads in the Sanur area there are many homestays ranging from those located on the main road to the remote areas there are also homestays, the number of homestays certainly makes the competition tighter both in price competition and facilities. The tight competition makes a homestay must have a distinctive design in order to give a different impression compared to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The bedroom and bathroom are the main facilities in a homestay. The level of customer satisfaction is determined based on the quality of the main facilities provided but apart</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">from the mentioned quality of friendly service will also certainly support the level of customer satisfaction. In an effort to achieve customer satisfaction, we need the main facilities that can bring a comfortable and friendly atmosphere, we need an approach to color and material. The Scandina-vian concept is a concept that emphasizes the characteristics of a simple design with neutral colors and emphasizes function so that it can be accepted by all ages.</span></p>
