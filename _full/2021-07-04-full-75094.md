<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract*</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">This research studies about topicalization of the Dawan language Mollo Dialect. The problems of this research are namely 1) is there any topic sentence in Dawan Language? 2) how is the topic sentence structure in Dawan Language?. The research located in Oelbubuk village, middle Mollo district, South Eastern Timor Regency, East Nusa Tenggara Province. This research is qualitative research. The data were taken from folklore text The methods used to collect the data were interview, observation and introspection. The technique used in this research are the disappearing technique, reverse technique, insertion technique, and chancing technique. The result of data analysis is an informal way by verbal description. The pragmatic theory is applied in data analysis. The result of this research is indicated that there is a topicalization structure in Dawan Language. Preposition es always appear in topicalization in Dawan Language as distinguished future of active voice structure and topic sentence. The appearance of clitic is also attached to the verb as a structure of a topic sentence in Dawan Language.</span></p>

This indicates that almost all areas in South Central Timor Regency are BD speaking areas (Fernandez, 1996). Dialectically, BD has a number of dialects, according to (Levi, 1978) by the speaking community, BD is grouped into several dialects namely Mollo, Amanatun, Amanuban, Amarasi, Amfoang, Biboki, Miomafo, Manlea, and Kupang.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In general, these dialects can be classified into two major dialects, namely the L dialect and the R dialect (Mbete, 1985). Geographically, dialect L is spoken in the areas of Mollo, Amanatun, Amanuban, Amfoang, Biboki, Miomafo, Manlea, Kupang, while dialect R is spoken in the Amarasi part of Kupang Regency. The distinguishing mark of the two dialect groups is the tendency of parallels, namely the tendency of the same lexicons to appear, which in one dialect group begins with the consonant /l/ for example leko ‘baik’ and the reko in the /r/ dialect group.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The term topic can be defined in several different senses, namely a) the phrase in one clause that is understood, b) phrases in an understandable discourse, c) having a special position in one discourse (the far right corner or the left corner of the clause). In general, it can be said that the topic is the same as the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Givon, 1984) stated that topicalization is something that is rather vague, has a scale, and is ranked based on its degree in sentences. This will be clearly seen in sentences containing subject, direct object, and indirect object. These dative forms experience a shift so that the object is not immediately promoted to the main object and the object is immediately shifted down.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In syntactic studies, the subject is limited to four concepts, namely pragmatic concepts, semantic concepts, categorical concepts, and grammatical concepts. The traditional definition of the term subject is what is said (Chafe, 1970). From a pragmatic, grammatical, and semantic perspective, the terms psychological subject, grammatical subject, and logical subject emerged (Halliday, 1988).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The understanding of the three kinds of subject terms confuses the notion of the subject. Therefore (Halliday, 1988) uses the term subject for grammatical subjects, while for psychological subjects the term theme is used and for logical subjects, the term actor is used. (Pike, 1977) and (Verhaar, 1996) distinguish subject and actor into two different levels of analysis, in which the subject is at the level of grammatical function, while the actor is in the level of role. In addition, the subject can also occupy a middle position in topicalization (Sugono, 1995).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In terms of semantics, the subject can have a certain semantic role. (Chafe, 1970) explained that in semantic structures, verbs function as central and nouns as peripheral. Verbs determine the presence of a noun, for example as an agent, patient, instrument, complement, and location.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theory</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In this study, there are three theoretical references used, namely a) Basic Linguistic Theory, b) Functional Typology, and c) Pragmatic Theory. Of the three theories, the main theory used to analyze the research data is the Pragmatic Theory.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>1.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic Linguistic Theory</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The Basic Linguistic Theory is put forward by (Dixon, 2012). The basic linguistic theory refers to the theoretical framework that is most widely used in the description of the language, in particular the grammatical description of an entire language. Basic linguistic theory is widely used and best known especially outside the United States. This theory is very popular among linguists who are more interested in using basic linguistic theory in analyzing the structure of a language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Basic linguistic theory is a cumulative framework that slowly develops over time that is used by linguists to better describe the structure of a language. It is based on traditional grammar emphasizing the need to describe each language in its own context, rather than imposing individual language concepts where the main motivation comes from another language. This theoretical framework takes analytic techniques from the structuralist tradition, especially in the fields of phonology and morphology which are purely structuralists in an effort to describe language including semantic considerations in its analysis by using terminology and phenomena in each language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The basic linguistic theory differs from many other theoretical frameworks in that it is not a formal theory but an informal theory. That is, Many grammatical phenomena can be defined in terms of adequate accuracy in a natural language.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>1.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Functional Typology Approach</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Etymologically, typology means a classification of domains. The term typology has the meaning of grouping languages based on their characteristic of words, sentence group, or grouping based on their structural characteristics. The study of linguistic typology is a study that determines the grouping of languages based on characteristics, interrelated structures. The form of a typology study is a word order typology as practiced by Greenberg (Mallinson, Graham, Blake, 1981). A study of Greenberg’s typology of word order shows that languages can be grouped according to word order in the basic clause, namely S-V-O. Studies that attempt to examine the grammatical features and characteristics of languages in the world, then make groupings according to parameters in the linguistic world or what is known as the study of linguistic typology. The results of this study gave birth to language typology, which is the grouping of languages with the designation of certain groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The purpose of linguistic typology is to group languages based on the nature or behavior of the language structure. Its main purpose is to answer the question: what is x language like? There are two main assumptions of linguistic typology, namely (a) all languages can be compared based on structure, and (b) there are also structural differences between languages. Based on the study of linguistic typology, the experts attempt to make a grouping (also called pentipology). With this pentipology, there is a language with a typology of nominative-accusative (accusative language), ergative-absolutive (ergative language), active language, and passive language (Comrie, 1988).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pentipology of languages based on grammatical behavior is also known as grammatical typology. This term is made to distinguish between grammatical typology studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and functional typology studies, namely typology studies whose studies are based on pragmatic features and functions or the function of language as a means of communication. So, in its development, the linguistic typology which was originally developed from grammatical typology developed into a functional typology study. However, the basis for the study of linguistic typology rests on grammatical typology which examines a language from the point of view of linguistic typology which is a natural-descriptive (Givon, 1984).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Givon, 1984) argued that the approach to language studies and analysis of language behavior may not be “silent” (off the hook) from the characteristics, structure, and behavior of language in its context as a means of communication. By paying attention to the main function of language as a means of communication, functional typology gets its analysis at a grammatical level by paying attention to the use of language in its context (pragmatic function) to express the essence of a language.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>1.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pragmatic Theory</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The main theory used as a basis for analyzing the research data is the pragmatic theory. Pragmatics is a branch of linguistics that is increasingly known today, although about two decades ago, this theory was rarely or almost never mentioned by linguists. This is based on the increasing awareness of linguists that efforts to uncover the nature of language will not bring the expected results without being based on an understanding of pragmatics, namely how language is used in communication (Lambrecht, 1996). (Lambrecht, 1996) also defined pragmatics as the study of meaning in relation to speech situations. Pragmatics is also defined as conditions that result in whether or not the use of language in communication is compatible; aspects of language use or context outside the language that contributes to the meaning of speech (Kridalaksana, 2008). According to (Verhaar, 1996) pragmatics is a branch of linguistics that discusses what is included in the structure of language as a means of communication between speakers and listeners, and as a reference to language signs in the “extra lingual” matters being discussed. (Kridalaksana, 1990) defined pragmatics as an analysis of utterance using context-bound meanings. Meanwhile, treating language pragmatically is treating language by considering its context, namely its use in communication events (Kridalaksana, 1990). Based on several opinions above, pragmatic boundaries defined. Pragmatics is a general study of how context affects speech participants in interpreting sentences or examining meaning in relation to speech situations.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>1.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information Structure</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The flexibility and empowerment of language as a means of communication has and continues to enable humans to develop socially, culturally, and intellectually. Language is a very complex sign system, bound by rules, and used by the speaking community to communicate. (Foley, 1997) stated that language, in general, is a sign system accompanied by the rules for its combination. All linguistic signs, expressions, indices, or symbols have a dual structure, namely the structure of form and structure of meaning. The two layers of the language structure, although there are no official rules governing them, cannot be made arbitrary. (Foley, 1997) stated that the principles of incorporation into the rules of the signs are arranged in such a way as to form sentences which are generally called the grammar of the language concerned. Each grammar of a language typically deals with two levels, namely morphology, and syntax (especially in agglutinative and polysynthetic languages).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Grammatically, a sentence is a construction that carries the main meaning in language. The package unit of grammatical meaning that is carried by the sentence is the package of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">complete meaningful utterance marked by the intonation unit of the core argument. (Gundel, 1988) asserted that the basic principle of grammar since the time of Plato and Aristotle is that sentences are divided into two main parts, subjects, and predicates. Although lexically the word also carries meaning, the packaging of the meaning carried by the sentence is the meaning of a linguistic unit that underlies the development of a broader meaning. Thus, the grammatical structure of the information is in the sentence. With regard to the structure of information, (Lambrecht, 1996) stated that the information structure is a component of grammarly sentence in which a proposition as a conceptual embodiment of a state is paired with a lexicogrammatical structure in relation to the mental state of the speaker who uses and interprets these structures as units of information in the context of a particular discourse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">More specifically, (Lambrecht, 1996) stated that the structure of sentence information is a formal expression and pragmatic structuring of a proposition in a discourse. Propositions that have an experiential pragmatic structuring are called pragmatically structured propositions. Important categories of information structures are (i) presuppositions and affirmations, relating to the structuring of propositions into parts in which a speaker hears the person spoken to; (ii) identification and activator, which relates to the speaker’s allegation about the state of mental manifestation of the discourse reference in the mind of the interlocutor at the time the speech occurs; and (iii) topic and focus, which deals with the approximate value of the relative estimate or unpredictability of the relationship between a proposition and its elements in a particular discourse situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The structure of information is formally manifested in the prosodic aspect, in special grammatical markers, in the form of syntactic elements (certain nominal), in the position and order of constituents in a sentence, in the form of complex grammatical constructs, and in the choice of certain words between lexical items. which is related. The analysis of information structures focuses on the comparison of pairs of sentences that are equivalent but formally and pragmatically different, such as active-passive, canonical-topicalize sentences, canonical sentences - splitting or releasing, subject emphasis sentences - predicate stress sentences, and so on (Lambrecht, 1996).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The analysis of the information structure in this paper is related to and directed to examine the sentence information structure in BD topicalization construction. This research, empirically, will look at the comparison of the information structure brought by the topicalized construction with the information structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In linguistics, the term topicalization is used to refer to a syntactic (derivative) construct in which the noun phrase (NP) in the basic (canonical) construction that is in the position after the verb (predicate) appears in the initial position before the subject (or directly before the verb) in languages with a 2-verb sequence, in which case the subject appears at the position of the object) (Lambrecht, 1996). (Lambrecht, 1996) argues that in English and French, for example, the topicalized phrase can appear in a topic or focus related to the proposition expressed by a sentence; Topic relations have a “focus - predicate” structure, and focus relations have an “argument - focus” structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">More specifically, (Lambrecht, 1996) explained that the topic of the sentence is something about the proposition expressed by the sentence. The definition of a topic in terms of the “about” relation between one being and a proposition, is actually derived from the traditional definition of “subject”. The two terms “topic” and “subject” are not absolutely the same even though they are related. The topic is not necessarily a grammatical subject, and a grammatical subject is not necessarily a topic. Topics can also be called pragmatically constructed sentences which must be understood as meanings framed by a particular discourse context.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Topicalization is a syntactic construction that places a constituent, which normally follows a verb, to the front (beginning) of a sentence, preceding the subject’s NP (Kroeger, 2004). The topic is a clause element related to pragmatics, while the subject is a sentence element related to the grammatical level. Not all arguments at the beginning of a clause (sentence) are subject. There are syntactic constructs whose initial element is the subject. There are syntactic constructs whose initial constituents are not grammatical subjects. This kind of construction is known as left-dislocation or topicalization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An example of topicalization is follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ita, in afi nem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nama, 3tgl kemarin datang</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">‘Ita, dia datang kemarin’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On this construction, Ita ‘nama’ has a TOP (topic) syntax function, then followed by in ‘dia’ has a syntactic function as S (subject), afi ‘kemarin’ has a syntactic function of adverb of time, and nem ‘datang’ has a syntactic function V (verb). The structure can be changed into:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(b). Afi, Ita nem</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Kemarin, Ita datang</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The approach taken in this study is a qualitative descriptive approach. (Bogdan &amp;&nbsp;Taylor, 1975) in (Moleong, 1990) adopted by (Muhammad, 2011) defined qualitative methodology as a research procedure that produces descriptive data in the form of words or verbally from people and observable behavior. The data used in this study were qualitative data related to the topicalization of the Dawan language. Data collection in this study was carried out using the listening method and speaking method. The method used in analyzing the data is the agih method, it is a method in which the determinant is part of the language itself, the listening method is a method that is carried out by listening, while the speaking (cakap) method is in the form of a conversation between the researcher and the informant. The techniques used in this research were lesap (disappearing) technique, reverse technique, insert technique, and ganti (chancing) technique.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic Structure of the Dawan Language Verbal Clause</span></p></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Verbal clauses are clauses whose predicates are filled in by verbs. Syntactically verbs are the core categories that appear in the predicate position of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on syntactic behavior, the verb is the essence of the verb phrase which is also the core constituent of a clause. It is the verb that determines whether an argument is present in a clause. Semantically, verbs are categories that refer to the meaning of action. Conversely, the verb syntactically is a core category that appears in the predicate position of the clause. From the semantic aspect, verbs talk about the number of participants or arguments involved in an event or situation, while from the syntactic aspect, verbs talk about the number of core arguments that must be present in a clause. By referring to the classification of verbs based on the semantic and syntactic aspects, BD clauses are classified into intransitive clauses, monotransitive clauses, and ditransitive clauses.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Topicalization</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">After describing the topicalization of BD in the previous section, the study in this section will begin with the topicalization in BD. Then the description will continue with the analysis of Sentence Information Structure, BD Topics and Topicalization, and BD Topicalization Clauses.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>4.3 1 Topicalization of the Mollo dialect of Dawan language</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Sentence analysis can be carried out at three levels of functions, namely syntactic functions, semantic functions, and pragmatic functions. Syntax functions are grammatical relationships between elements that function as subjects, predicates, objects, complements and descriptions. The semantic function is the relationship of meaning between elements that function as predictors and elements that function as arguments. The relationship between the argument and the predictor is also called the role. The role of semantics in sentences is divided into; respondent, actor, subject, characteristic, target, result, user, size, tool, place, source, reach, companion, time, and origin. Pragmatic functions are functions that relate to the information status of construction, namely elements that function as old information and elements that function as new information (Jufrizal, 2004)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The elements of a pragmatic function that are interconnected in a sentence will form an information structure. Broadly speaking, the information structure is an encoding of a more informative part of the sentence in relation to a certain context. More specifically, the structure of the information relates to the way the speaker and his speech partner interpret information based on the shared knowledge of the speech participants during the speech. This knowledge can be recognized in sentences as a status of information that is already known (old information) and information that is just known (new information). Topicalization is a syntactic construction that places a constituent, which normally follows a verb, to the front (beginning) of a sentence, preceding the subject’s NP. Referring to the above statement, there is also topicalization in BD. The following is an example of topicalization in BD.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(60) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Au iun oel</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">1TG minum air ‘Saya minum air’. b. Oel au iun</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Air 1TG minum</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">‘Air saya minum’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Data (60.a) is called the active sentence because au ‘saya’ has a syntactic function S (subject), iun ‘minum’ has a syntactic function P (predicate), and oel ‘air has an O (object) syntactic function. While in data (60.b) oel ‘air’ as TOP (topic), au ‘saya’ as S (subject) and iun ‘minum’ as V (verb). Oel ‘air’ s referred to as the topic sentence because oel ‘air’ is the core of the conversation in the sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sentence Information Structure, Topic and Topicalization of Mollo Dialect in Dawan Languag. Considering the grammatical properties of the basic BD clauses, the typology of word order in this regional language is S - V - O. As reported by (Jufrizal, 2004), a grammatical typology examination of basic clauses shows that the usual word order in BD, both in command clauses, statements, and questions is S - V - O. The choice of other forms with O - S - V and V -S - O word order is only possible in constructions with verbs without affixes or in derivative constructs, including the construction of topicalized clauses, as will be the main subject of this paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The results of the grammatical typology research conducted by (Jufrizal, 2004) stated that BD is a language with a nominative-accusative typology at the syntactic level, with word order in</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the basic clauses of S - V - O. As a morphologically agglutinative language, the presence of affixes in verbs has an important role both grammatically and semantically. It is also stated that this local language is a subject prominent language. Thus, the basic construction of the BD clause is more appropriate to be treated as constructing “Subject - Predicate”, not “Topic”. However, the grammatical properties of BD cannot be completely separated from the pragmatic influence so that the syntactic construction can undergo a change in word order to become O - S - V and V - S - O. The construction of clauses with the O - S - V and V - S - O orders is considered a derivative construction because there is a change in the verb markers and their word order from the construction which is considered a basic clause. This kind of construction in this paper is called topicalized construction. Examples of clauses are below.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(61) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Au ait benas</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">ambil 1TG parang ‘Ambil parang saya.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Data (61.a) is referred to as an active clause. Meanwhile, data (61.b) and (61.c) are derivative constructs of active clauses. On data (61.a) au ‘saya’ has a syntactic function of an S (subject), ait ‘ambil’ has a P (predicate) syntactic function, and benas ‘parang’ has an O (object) syntactic function. The data (61.b) is referred to as topicalization where benas ‘parang’ is as a TOP (topic), au ‘saya’ as S (subject) and ait ‘ambil’ as V (verb). Ait ‘ambil’ referred to as a topic because ait ‘ambil’ is the core of the conversation in the sentence. While data (61.c) ait ‘ambil’ has a syntactic function of a P (predicate), au ‘saya’ has a S (subject) syntactic function, and benas ‘parang’ has an O (object) syntactic function. Data (61.c) is referred to as a pragmatic construction because it is seen from the literal translation of the clause Ait au benas that is supposed to have the meaning ‘ambil saya parang’ but because it is influenced by the information structure and pragmatic status, the meaning of the clause Ait au benas according to the people of Dawan is ‘ambil parang saya’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Topicalization Clause in the Mollo Dialect of Dawan Language</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the results of field research, the researcher found that there was clause topicalization in BD. Topicalization of BD can be seen in the following clause (62-68) data.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">‘Tempat itu, mereka yang sepakati’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If attention is given, the BD topicalization structure, grammatically, the position or sentence structure positions the TOP at the beginning of the sentence, S is in the middle of the sentence, then followed by the VERB which is at the end of the sentence, as in the data (62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, and 68).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The clause in (62-68) which is neno ma pahpinan ‘langit dan bumi’ (in data 62), tuapakas ante bitan ‘tuapakas sampai bitan’ (in data 63), be’it a’naek ‘kekuatan besar’ (in data 64), suku teun le’nan ‘ketiga suku itu’ (in data 65), atukus namfau ‘banyak penjaga’ (in data 66), haumeni ‘kayu cendana’ (in data 67), and bale le’nan ‘tempat itu’ (in data 68) which appears at the initial position of the clause and is not the subject, but the topic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The basic concept of grammatical relations is based on the opinion given by Comrie (1989: 65), which stated that grammatical relations are parts or elements of a sentence that are categorized as Subject (S), Direct Object (DO), and Indirect Object (IO). The three grammatical relations are syntactic relations, and there are relations that are semantic, namely: locative, benefactive, and instrumental, collectively called the oblique relation of Blake in (Artawa, 2004). Grammatical relations in this case provide an appropriate concept, both about how language works in general, as well as certain languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Comrie (1989) stated that the prototype (nature of origin) of the subject is a link between the agent and the topic. Cross-linguistically, the subject is both the agent and the topic. Meanwhile, the object is an argument that undergoes an action which is stated by the transitive verb. Arguments that experience actions expressed by these verbs occupy the second position in the hierarchy of grammatical functions after the subject (Verhaar, 1996) and (Jufrizal, 2004). The direct object (DO) and indirect object (IO) must appear together in the clause with ditransitive verbs, for example, the verb gives in Indonesian (Jufrizal, 2004).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The clause, in ‘dia’ (in data 62), suku bessi ‘suku bessi’ (in data 63), moa hitu ‘nama’ (pada data 64), benafa ‘nama’ (in data 65), in ‘dia’ (in data 66), sin ‘mereka’ (in data 67), dan sin ‘mereka’ (in data 68) is a subject and it all appeared before Neno ma pahpinan ‘bumi dan langit’, tuapakas ante bitan ‘tuapakas sampai bitan’, be’it a’naek ‘kekuatan besar’, suku teun le’nan ‘ketiga suku itu’, atukus namfau ‘banyak penjaga’, haumeni ‘kayu cendana’, and bale le’nan ‘tempat itu’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Jufrizal, 2004) stated that the subject cross-language has distinctive characteristics and behaviors. These behaviors can be grouped into four characteristics, namely: (i) the nature of the autonomous behavior; (ii) the nature of the perpetrators of the case; (iii) semantic role; and (iv) direct dominance. These four characteristics have a different character of subtlety, which is described below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The characteristics of the subject’s autonomy behavior include: (a) independent existence; (b) indispensability; (c) autonomous reference. The nature of the case marker behavior includes: (a) the subject of an intransitive sentence is generally not marked if each NP in that language is unmarked; (b) NP which changes its case marker on the included subject; (c) NP which changes the case marker of the nominalization of the action including the subject. The semantic role</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(agent, patient) of the subject is thought to be the main form of the verb. Based on this semantic role, subject include: (a) the subject if only one usually discloses the agent (of the act); (b) the subject usually expresses the addressee phrase in an imperative form; (c) the subject usually shows the position of the case marker corresponding to the same verb as the cause NP in the causative sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The examination of the subject’s behaviors is based on the grammatical behaviors that have been carried out by (Artawa, 2004) in the Balinese language. According to him, because the subject is a grammatical relation, the determiner of the subject of a language should be based on the nature of its own grammatical behavior. Based on this, the subject can be seen in terms of: (1) no-light pronoun (PRO), (2) quantifier float, (3) relativization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Next, es ‘yang’ in data (62) clarify that neno ma pahpinan ‘bumi dan langit’ is supported by in ‘dia’, es ‘yang‘ in data (63) clarify that tuapakas sampai bitan ‘tuapakas ante bitan’ is guarded by suku bessi ‘suku bessi’, es ‘yang’ in data (64) clarify that be’it a’naek ‘kekuatan besar’ is owned by moa hitu ‘moa hitu’, es ‘yang’ in data (65) clarify that suku teun le’nan ‘ketiga suku itu’ is guarded by benafa ‘benafa’, es ‘yang’ data (66) clarify that atukus namfau ‘ ‘banyak penjaga’ is owned by benafa ‘benafa’, es ‘yang’ in data (67) clarify taht haumeni ‘kayu cendana’ is bought by sin ‘mereka’, es ‘yang’ in data (68) clarify that bale le’nan ‘tempat itu’ is guarded by sin ‘mereka’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Furthermore, on data (62) an-su ‘pikul’, data (63) an-pao ‘jaga’, data (64) an-mui ‘miiki’, data (65) an-jail ‘jadi’, data (66) an-mui ’miliki’, data (67) an-sos ‘beli’, data (68) an-nekafmese ‘sepakat’ are verbs. In data (62-68) there is a clitical aspect ‘an’ and the clitic aspect refers to the subject attached to the verb, namely in ‘dia’ in data (62), suku bessi ‘suku bessi’ in data (63), moa hitu ‘moa hitu’ in data (64), benafa ‘benafa’ in data (65), in ‘dia’ in data (66), sin ‘mereka’ in data (67), and sin ‘mereka’ in data (68). Here’s the subject pronoun in BD.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Based on the data example (62-68) is the construction of the topicalized clause in BD. If the active clause is considered a basic clause, then the topicalized clause is a derived clause. Somewhat different from the passive construction whose syntactic process is grammatical, the topicalized construction is a construction that occurs at the syntactic level with the influence of pragmatic functions. Based on the basic (active) clause, the grammatical processes that occur to give birth to a topicalized construction are: There is a shift in the information structure brought about by this construction semantically and pragmatically, namely from the prominence of the topic of conversation, however, the NP that is highlighted does not reach its position as a grammatical subject but as a topic. In accordance with the pragmatic theoretical framework used, as described above, constructs such as clause data (62-68) are topicalized constructs in BD.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Novelties</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Topical dialect of Dawan language can be applied in the field of knowledge such as in the subject of Bahasa Indonesia because the Dawan language also has various levels of dialects and functions as in Bahasa Indonesia. And the Dawan dialect can be used in several regions such as South Central Timor, Amarasi, and North Central Timor.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Topicalization in BD always presents the preposition ‘es’ as the difference between the active sentence structure and the topic sentence. The topic sentence structure in BD also has a clitical aspect inherent in verbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The structure of linguistic information carried by the topicalized construction in BD gives semantic and pragmatic cues that the role of NP as a subject still exists, but its function is as a topic. In the topicalized construction, the role of the grammatical subject in the NP of the agent is not eliminated, which only shifts to its role as a topic. Thus, the construction of topicalization is oriented to the topic or something that is the subject of discussion.</span></p>
