Central AC chilled water system is an air conditioning system that has cooling ability in more than one room The system has two cycles consist of primary and secondary cycles When primary cycle works the refrigerant is used as a working fluid while in the secondary cycle process the water is used as working fluid To determine the heat absorbed by water it can be done by analyzing NTU Number of Transfer Unit of the water chiller system The variation of the
