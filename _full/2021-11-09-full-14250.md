  - "through chemical processes or biological processes. Filtrationmethod can be done by using a sieve"
  - "absorption or ion exchange. The filter can filterparticles contained in the water according to the size of the strainer holes that can be passedby the water. Type of water filter media which is still widely used in various industries andhouseholds is the sand filter media"
  - "zeolites"
  - "and activated carbon because its construction isvery simple so it is relatively easy and inexpensive manufacturing"
  - "can produce sufficientwater quality for industrial and household purposes. Active sand is one of the media used tomeet the needs of the filter media. The function of active sand is to filter out large/smallparticles in the water of water purification. Active sand is black and commonly used as areplacement for silica sand for the initial screening stage. Observations of water pressure dropin the filter with active sand media has done experimentally. By knowing the information aboutthe water pressure drop value"
  - "then the value of the pressure drop in the pipe system can beobtained more accurately so that the selection of pumps required specifications become moreaccurate. Before the experiment"
  - "the characteristics of the water pressure drop in the filtersand"
  - "earlier studied using dimensional analysis with Buckingham PI theorem. Pressure drop(?P)"
  - "the diameter of the tube filter (D)"
  - "tall sand in the filter (H)"
  - "the water flow rate (Q)"
  - "thedensity of water (??) and density of sand (?p) are the variables included in the dimensionalanalysis. From dimensional analysis shows that the water pressure in the filter depends on several variables such as the flow of water"
  - "the ratio of the tube diameter and high sand filter(D / H). Experiments in the laboratory have been conducted to determine the relationshipbetween these variables carefully and know the water pressure drop in the formulation ofactive sand filters. Observations have been made by varying the flow rate of water on somehigh ratio of diameter and tube. Then the results are also compared with cartridge filter withactive sand media sold in the market. Finally"
  - "formulations of water pressure drop (?P) isobtained as follows?P = K . . Q2Keywords: Filter the water"
  - "the sand is active"
  - "the pressure drop"
