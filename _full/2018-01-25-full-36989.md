<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract. </span><span class="font1">Trigona is a stingless bee that protects itself by swarming and biting. The bee products that are widely used in addition to honey are propolis, wax and the royal jelly. Trigona bee is one of potentially honey producer that has not been widely known. One species of trigona bee found in Bali is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trigona laeviceps</span><span class="font1">. They are nested in the crevices of rocks or in the tree trunk. This research aims to determine variations of entrance shapes, food storage, and brood cells of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">T. laeviceps</span><span class="font1"> from different altitudes. Colonies were observed in the Laboratory of Animal Taxonomy, Biology Department, Faculty of Mathematics and Basic Sciences, Udayana University, and nest entrance was analyzed in the Analytic Laboratory, Udayana University. Colonies were collected from bamboo nest in a tubular form and wooden nest from wooden boxes. Nest entrance is either flat or protruded out of the nest in an oval shape. The form of the entrance is not affected by the altitude. The nest entrance contained around 0,05 % flavonoids. The size and shape of pollen and honey pots volume was lightly lager in colonies collected from altitudes more than 400m above sea level (0.058 ± 0.04 mm³) than colonies collected from altitudes less than 400 m above sea level (0.035 ± 0.03 mm³). Royal jelly pots and brood cells have also similar shapes, but the volume is larger in colonies collected from altitudes less than 400 m above sea level (0.015 ± 0.07mm³) compared to altitude of more than 400 m above sea level (0.011 ± 0.02 mm³ )</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The Trigona bee is one of the stingless bees, that has a form of self-defense by biting its incoming predators. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trigona laeviceps</span><span class="font1"> have small body size (± 4mm) compared with other honey-producing bees [1]. One of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trigona </span><span class="font1">bee species found in Bali is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">laeviceps</span><span class="font1">. The Genus of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trigona</span><span class="font1"> in Bali has been known widely distributed from a height of 5 metres above sea level up to 800 metres above sea level [2].</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trigona</span><span class="font1"> bee will generally make its nest in places that already has a gap or a small hole, such as on tree trunks, ground, and or on the wall. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trigona</span><span class="font1"> nests generally has an entrances with different shapes which is specific to species. The nest entrances are made of resins, propolis and a water-like saliva, mixed with soil to enhance the strength of the entrance [3, 4].</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The inside of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trigona</span><span class="font1"> nest contains brood cells, honey pots, the pots of royal jelly batumen, that is a structure to support the cells and pots [5]. The trigona bees are highly social insects that lives in a colony, each bee has its own duty, the female queen is in charge of laying eggs, female working bees are responsible for cleaning the nest, feeding the broods, and searching for food, while the male bees are responsible for fertilizing the queen and keeping the nest from predators [6].</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This study was conducted to identify the shape, size and materials used by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">T. laeviceps</span><span class="font1"> to build the nest entrances of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">T. laeviceps</span><span class="font1"> as well as the size of the honey pots, pollen pots, brood cells, and royal jelly pots from colonies at different altitudes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESEARCH METHODS</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Colony of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trigona laeviceps</span><span class="font1"> were collected from several habitats at different altitudes. Three colonies were collected from the altitude of &lt;400 m above sea level and another 3 colonies were from the altitude of &gt;&nbsp;400 m above sea level. Types of plants growing around the nests were recorded, as well as the temperature and humidity. Observation of the nest entrances i.e. length, width, and diameter of the entrances was conducted in situ with calipers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Ilustration of length and width measurement can be seen in Figure 1. Colonies were transported to the Laboratory of Animal Taxonomy, Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Basic Sciences, Udayana University, Bali for further examination. The honey and pollen pots, and the brood cells were harvested in the Lab, and measure with a caliper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The flavonoids content of the nest entrance was analyzed in Spectrophotometric method using Quercetin as a standard following Rahman [7], conducted at the Laboratory of Food Technology Faculty of Udayana University. The diameter of nets entrance was measured using the following formula:</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trigona laeviceps</span><span class="font1"> was found nested at a wide range of altitude, from around 5m above sea level (asl) up to 759 m asl. It has been found by Michener [8] that Trigona was found at different altitude up to 800 m asl. At this study, samples were collected from different places with its specific environment, those were Serangan, Padangsam-bian, Gegelang, Pangsan, Mawang, and Duda. Serangan village is located at altitude of 5 m above sea level (asl) with an average temperature of 33° C and a 65% humidity. The village of Padangsambian is located at an altitude of 35 m asl, with the average temperature of 29° C and a 68% humidity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The bee colonies at these two villages were found in the settlement area. The village of Gegelang lies at an altitude of 189 m asl, with the average temperature of 29.3° C and a 66% humidity, while the bee colony are found at the plantation area. Pangsan Village is located at high altitude (487 m asl) with an average temperature of 26.6°C and a 68% humidity. Bee colonies were found at the settlements and around </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">salak</span><span class="font1"> (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Salaca edulis</span><span class="font1">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">plantations. Mawang Village is located at altitude of 759 m asl, with an average temperature of 27.9° C and a 76% humidity where bee colonies found at the cacao plantation area. Duda Village is located at an altitude of 503 m asl with an average temperature of 26° C and a 67% humidity, and bee colony was found around </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">salak</span><span class="font1"> plantation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Colonies of the Trigona bee were found nested in bamboo and in a wooden boxes (Figure 2). In the other site word wide, Trigona bee were found nested in the plant holes, wall and in other crevices [9]. Sakagami et.al [3] found that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">T. laeviceps</span><span class="font1"> was nesting in the cracks of buildings and soil.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/36989-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:227pt;height:128pt;">

<p><span class="font1">The entrance of the nests of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">T. laeviceps</span><span class="font1"> was found located at the side or near the bottom part of the nests in protrude oval shape, with diameter range from 0.09 to 1.68 mm. The variation of nest entrance found in this study is presented in Figure 3.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/36989-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:233pt;height:124pt;">

Variations form of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">T. laeviceps</span><span class="font1"> nest entrance collected from different location: (a) Serangan, (b) Padangsambian, (c) Gegelang, (d) Pangsan, (e) Mawang, and (f) Duda villages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The size of the nest entrance was slightly larger (average 2.96 mm) in colonies collected from altitude of &gt;400 m asl compared to habitats with altitudes of &lt;400 m asl (average 1.97 mm). The analysis of material that used to build the nest entrance was found contain of flavonoids in varying concentrations. Flavonoids are synthesized by plants as a small molecule of secondary metabolites with various biological activities [10]. In general, the flavonoid content of the nest entrance of trigona nest was less than 0.05% (Table 1). The entrance of a tube-shaped nest will</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">directly leads the foraging individuals into the nest and to the food storage [11]. The entrance for trigona bees also serves as a nest defense against predatory attacks [3]. The variation of flavonoid content of the nest entrance may depend on the time and plant visited while the forager bees foraging for flavonoids. The present and the biological function of the flavonoids in plants were found as defens eagainst UV-B radiation and pathogen infection [12].</span></p>
