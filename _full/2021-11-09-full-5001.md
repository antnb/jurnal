<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of the study</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">There are many kinds of literature in English. Literature itself can be divided into some parts such as poem, drama, and prose. In their process of writing, some literary words contain a lot of figurative language. Translating figurative language cannot be done word by word based on dictionary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Figurative language is language that uses words or expressions with a meaning that is different from the literal interpretation. A good translator should understand types of meaning that exist in the texts, because it is understood that there are many types of meaning. True meaning of words is found of resolving what people do with them, not what they say about it, and the context will determine them. Each language has its own idiomatic way of expressing meaning through lexical items such as idioms, secondary meaning, metaphor, and figurative meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jane Eyre</span><span class="font2"> is a novel by English writer Charlotte Brontë. It was published in London, England, in 1847 by Smith, Elder &amp;&nbsp;Co. It was very interesting to classify</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the types of English figurative found in this novel based on six types of figurative language proposed by the theory of Larson and analyzingthe meaning of English figurative languages from source language (SL) into target language (TL) is also the important point to know.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">wassaid to be alive and do an activity like an animate. The second example </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Our Journey</span><span class="font2">was used </span><span class="font0">to </span><span class="font2">analogize their life when marriage took place.

<p><span class="font2">The first example</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">No longer silent as a church</span><span class="font2"> is a metaphor. In this sentence, the word Thornfield was compared with a church. The situation in the church was used to analogize the situation in Thornfield before it was changed, silent and no crowd.</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I am as hard and tough as an indiarubber ball</span><span class="font2"> is the next example of metaphor. This sentence meant that Rochester had the same characteristic like a rubber ball which is tough and strong to face a problem. In other words, Rochester was convinced Jane not to worry about him for what had happened. The third example</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Do you think I am a machine without feelings?</span><span class="font2">a comparison again between Jane and a machine. Jane compared herself with machine when she already felt tired for what had she faced in her life. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I will leave you by yourself, white dream</span><span class="font2">was used in figurative way to analogize the dress as her dream too. She felt that it was an impossible thing to get.</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A little French flower might grow up well in an English garden</span><span class="font2">wasused to compare little Adela with a flower that could be blossomed in future. English garden was also used in figurative way to describe his own place at Thornfield. The next example is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">there was a strange fire in his look.</span><span class="font2"> The word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fire</span><span class="font2"> was used throughout the novel to represent passion as an uncontrollable force. When it first becametruly obvious that Rochester had feeling for Jane, she had just saved him from the fire in his bed. The last example is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I must be careful of you, my treasure.</span><span class="font2"> In this sentence, Rochester compared Jane with a treasure. Treasure is a precious thing that always hunted by a lot of people in this world. The sentence described how worth Jane for his life. Jane was his treasure in his life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Based on the theory proposed by Larson, the figurative languages found and analyzed in Jane Eyre novel consisted of three metonymy, three synecdoche, one idiom, six hyperbole, seven metaphor and eight simile. Metaphor and simile were mostly found in this novel because the writer used a lot of comparison to describe something. It was used to help the reader get the meaning easily, using single expression. Each of these figurative languages had been analyzed based on their characteristic and their functions.</span></p>
