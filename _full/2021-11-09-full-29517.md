Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, his explication emphasizes</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_form"><span class="font3"> form,</span></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulation_(music)"><span class="font3"> articulation,</span></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_(poetry)"><span class="font3"> meter,</span></a><span class="font3"> and</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"><span class="font3"> symmetry </span></a><span class="font3">of expression.

<p><span class="font3">The data on the study were taken from song lyrics from band Bring Me the Horizon. According to Brown (2001), “Research is an exploration of experience of one kind or</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">another, sometimes formal and technical, but necessary”. He also states that “a good way to understanding the nature of research is to first experience it by doing it, initially in a simple and elementary way”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">&gt; </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The House of Wolves and Sleepwalking</span></p></li></ul>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Simile</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Simile is a stated comparison, introduced by like or as. The following Examples of simile used in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The House of Wolves</span><span class="font3">: “Will burn just like a thousand suns” (line 26), and simile used in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sleepwalking</span><span class="font3">: “it’s like I’m sleep walking” (line 12). Similes in this poem help the readers compare what the poet means to another object used.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Personification</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Personification gives human characteristics to an object, animal, or an abstract idea. Personification is a metaphor, of course, in the sense that there is an implied comparison between a nonhuman thing and a human being. The following Examples of personification used in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The House of Wolves</span><span class="font3">: “cloak and daggers murder the truth” (line 8), “these walls begin to cave in” (line 12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And personification used in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sleepwalking</span><span class="font3">: “from my heart and my bones catch a fever” (line 2), “your eyes are swallowing me” (line 5), “mirrors starts to whisper” (line 6), “shadows start to see” (line 7), “my skin’s smothering me” (line 8)</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Hyperbole</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Hyperbole is an exaggeration used for special effect. The following Examples of hyperbole used in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The House of Wolves</span><span class="font3">: “death is the only salvation you will feel” (line 4), “my soul can’t be saved if I sell you my sins” (line 16) and “is burning a thousand suns” (line 22), and hyperbole used in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sleepwalking</span><span class="font3">:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“it’s hard to find a way to breathe” (line 4)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">a.</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Wolves</span><span class="font3"> can be interpreted universally as a representation of is the horror place where the bad guys gather and live and someone pray to god the bad guy will get karma for everything they have done</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">b.</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleepwalking</span><span class="font3"> can be interpreted universally as a representation is someone who has a nightmare until he or she feels like to be a sleep walker, he or she feels like in the two worlds between reality and dream.</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In this case my focus in on intrinsic approach to know what symbol is and figurative meaning on Bring Me The Horizon’s in Album “</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sempiternal”</span><span class="font3">. The extrinsic approach is also involved, namely the biography of the poet that bears significance to the compositions of the lyrics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the analysis presented in the previous chapter, it is clear that the use of symbol in both to make a lyrics more beautiful and to express the imagination and ideas indirectly. Through the use of symbols the poet can be considered successful in making the lyrics as an effective media to attain both the entertaining and teaching purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The meaning of Bring Me The Horizon’s lyrics is found, of course, almost entirely on the symbolic level. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The House of Wolves</span><span class="font3"> can be interpreted universally as a representation of is the horror place where the bad guys gather and live and someone pray to god the bad guy will get karma for everything they have done.</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sleepwalking</span><span class="font3"> can be interpreted universally as a representation is someone who has a nightmare until he or she feels like to be a sleep walker, he or she feels like in the two worlds between reality and dream.</span></p>
