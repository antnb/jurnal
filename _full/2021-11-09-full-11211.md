A study has been carried out to obtain the model legume association with superior grassplants that are adaptive to repair postmining land on dry land In the early stages theresearch carried out on nonmining land to observe potential association models thatpredicted very suitable to recover the postmining land Experiment using a randomizedblock design with 12 combinations between grasses legumes and mycorrhizal and repeatedthree times Grass used is Panicum
