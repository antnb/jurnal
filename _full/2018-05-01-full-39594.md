<p><span class="font2">goddess Arimbi is a “rakseksi”, which is likened to his mother giant then his son is also a giant. This is what distinguishes the story of the puppet of India and Indonesia version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gatotkaca when he was a child named Jabang Tetuka, when he must fight with a giant, Tekuka was very strong accepting hit or blow. At that time, God knows the power Tetuka, then as the decision of the gods, Jabang Tetuka forced into the crater Candradimuka and Gods throw so many Gods’ weapons and he became very big. Therefore, Jabang Tetuka given the name Gatotkaca, Gatotkaca in the sense of herd-Gods’ weapons gathering into one or in the puppets mentioned “kumpule lelandep sing nyawiji” in the body of Gatotkaca that makes his big body. This is what causes Gatotkaca to be magic or called otot kawat balung wesi so it can beat the Sakipu and its king named Kalapracona.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gatotkaca grows out of a normal human being and he is veri big just ik a giant because of the forging of the gods, it can be said that the growth of Gatotkaca was the creation of the gods to confront Sakipu and Kalapracona. It also makes Gatotkaca died in young age in the battlefield. The fall of Gatotkaca is called as ‘the dead of senapati’, because he death for the truth and justice and also petrified his parents to be victorious in the war of Bharatayudha.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gatotkaca is a humble character, who has a high nationalism spirit. Gatotkaca is invisible but not arrogant, that's the positive side that can be taken from Gatotkaca. Gatotkaca's power is only to eradicate viciousness even though his life is at stake. Please note that in using a such power, Gatotkaca always uses it heartly within pure and sincere actions. The power is also to protect and nurture the weakness of his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is also a dress worn by leather puppet figures not only to cover body or decoration, but the clothing is also as a marker or status played by each character in the shadow puppets. It can be said that fashion is also very influential in every character of shadow puppets. There is also a clothing that is not visible, one of the characters who wear it is Gatotkaca. Gatotkaca is wearing a magic dress, the properties are gifts from the gods in the form of Caping Basunanda, Kotang Antra Kusuma, and Trompah Padakacarma. His skin inside and out of his muscle and meat in puppetry languange is usually pronounced “sak njabane kulit sak njerone daging”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Caping Basunanda lies in the head, its supernatural power is when it is under sun’s heat so he will not feel hot and when it rains he will not be wet. As in the following figure</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Discussion</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Character of Gatotkaca Characters in Surakarta Style Puppetry</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the story of puppetry Gatotkaca is a powerful and humble figure, who has high spirit of nationalism. Gatotkaca is a patriot [5], he is so obedient to the kingdom, the family, and to the truth he holds. Please note that in using such power, it is used to protect his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">E-Journal of Cultural Studies </span><span class="font1">DOAJ Indexed (Since 14 Sep 2015) </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">ISSN 2338-2449 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/"><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is also seen during the war of the Baratayudha, Gatotkaca was formulating war strategy in the air. His power in war is his ability to uproot the enemy's neck, but this is only done, if the circumstances are urgent [6]. His attack also made the troops from Kurawa and Adipati Karna depressed. Realize his end is near [7], Gatotkaca still had time to think how to kill Kurawa troops in large numbers. It appears that Gatotkaca is a formidable warrior in warfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gatotkaca is also a young warrior who has a great responsibility in maintaining the security and tranquility of the world. When he had just graduated, had led air operations against the giants Sakipu and Prabu Kala Pracona [8]. This task is the first for Gatotkaca to quell crime. So it is not surprising if the gods give this heavy task to Gatotkaca, because Gatotkaca can complete the mission well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Symbolic Meaning of Gatotkaca’s Dress Properties in Surakarta Puppetry Style</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Caping Basunanda has deep meaning that by thinking and exporing human being can reach the highest spiritual peak so as to be united with the Divine. Because through this thought humans can find a philosophy of life that is also identified as a way and view of life. In other words, life experiences and worldviews are linked by the mind and way of thinking and that interpretation determines the order of life [9]. So it can be said that the view of human life is the result of thought and interpretation based on the thorough experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Kotang Antra Kusuma is located on the Gatotkaca’s chest, it makes Gatotkaca can fly as fast as lightning or in term of puppet show it can be named “mabur tanpa lar lan melethik tanpa sotang”. The supernatural powers of this Kotang Antra Kusuma can light up like in the darkness. This is a symbol of human attitudes or characters associated with feelings that are also covered in the affective domain. Feelings are the sensitivity in the human being to the symptoms that arise from an event. In this sense sense is as a tool or means of perception or function of the whisper of heart or intuition [10]. Therefore every human being has a degree of sensitivity to the events that are present inside him or his surroundings. For Javanese cuture, the color and the concrete dimension of one's sense depends on the way of life, the level of education, and the orientation of the people's own mystical life [11].</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Terompah Padakacarma lies on both Gatotkaca’s legs, Terompah Padakacarma is the skin of Antaboga, the god of snakes. Its supernatural power is Gatotkaca wi be safe wherever he passes through holy or sacred place.

This can be done gradually and interconnected between the knowledge of values of behavior with a strong attitude or emotion to implement it for God, himself, his fellows, environment, and nation [12].
