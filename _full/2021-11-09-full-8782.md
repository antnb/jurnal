<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bahasa wanita sangat menarik untuk diteliti karena erat kaitannya dengan variasi gender yang merupakan tolak ukur dari penggunaan bahasa itu sendiri. Menurut Lakoff (1975) terdapat sepuluh bentuk bahasa yang biasa digunakan oleh wanita untuk menunjukkan keraguan.Walaupun banyak ahli berpendapat bahwa bentuk bahasa wanita adalah bentuk bahasa yang khusus digunakan oleh wanita, namun O’Barr dan Atkins (1980) menyatakan bahwa bentuk bahasa wanita juga dapat digunakan oleh pria jika mereka berada dalam status sosial yang lebih rendah. Artikel ini bertujuan untuk menganalisa bentuk bahasa wanita yang digunakan oleh tokoh utama wanita dan pria dalam flim ‘Music dan Lirik’ serta fungsinya. Dan juga membandingkan jumlah bentuk bahasa wanita yang digunakan oleh kedua tokoh utama untuk mengetahui siapa yang lebih banyak menggunakan bentuk bahasa wanita dalam flim ini. Selain itu faktor penggunaan bahasa wanita itu juga dianalisis menggunakan teori yang dicetuskan oleh Coates (1986). Data yang digunakan diambil dari percakapan antara tokoh utama pria dan wanita dalam flim ‘Musik dan Lirik’ dan dianalisis menggunakan metode deskriptif kuantitatif. Berdasarkan analisis, ditemukan bahwa ada Sembilan bentuk bahasa wanita yang digunakan oleh tokoh utama pria dan wanita yang mana kebanyakan dari bentuk bahasa wanita itu diucapkan bukan oleh pemeran utama wanita namun pemeran utama pria. Hal ini disebabkan oleh beberapa faktor pendukung yaitu: social status, subordinate groups, prestige and stigma, social network dan the acquisition of sex differential language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kata kunci</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">: bentuk bahasa wanita, status sosial, bahasa formal</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of the Study</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Coates (1986:4) states that, in different social context an individual will speak in different ways. Moreover, Linguists claimed that female are more linguistically polite than male and both of male and female emphasize different speech functions (holmes, 1992:33). It is found that male and female often use different linguistic forms and address terms in speaking English even in the same speech community. The use of the standard might be seen as yet another reflection of women’s powerless</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">in the public sphere. This interpretation accorded well with one of the assumptions made by early gender scholars such as Lakoff (1975), who saw women’s language as the “language of powerless” a reflection of their subordinate place in relation to men. However, O’Barr and Atkins’s (1980) finding that some of the features thought to be part of “women language” were also used by males when in the subordinate position.</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font0">(Tabel 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Most of the features were more often spoken by the man main character rather than woman character.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing Factors of Phenomena Found in Movie “Music and Lyric” with Using Coates Theory (1986)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Status</span></p></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Mr. Alex Fletcher in this movie is a singer that involved in the broadcasting area, so he have to manage his language and using standard language because his occupation asserted him to tough with high class people. While Miss Fisher, the woman main character is just a common person that did not have particular social status that forced her to use standard language.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subordinate Groups</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Mr. Alex Fletcher in this case had bigger necessity than Miss Fisher because really needed a lyricist. Therefore it could be said that Mr. Fletcher was in the subordinate position, so he had to be polite to Miss Fisher.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prestige and Stigma</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Mr. Fletcher occupation required him to use standard language. He had to watch over his language since he came from high class people. If he spoke roughly, it would fall his prestige. While Miss Fisher’s utterance was also not rough but less formal than Mr. Fletcher utterance.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>5.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Network</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Mr. Fletcher did not have opportunity to speak vernacular since his occupation and social background did not support it. So, he had tight-knit social network. Meanwhile Miss Fisher had close-knit social network because she was a common person which was close to each other.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>5.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition of Sex Differentiated Language</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Mr. Fletcher had entered broadcasting area since he was a child. It indicated that his childhood had been involved by his occupation where he had to manage his language whereas Miss Fisher also did not speak rough because as a woman she had to manage her language. In addition, she was also doing babysit that require her to use proper language.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">From the analysis of the study, it can be concluded that there are nine women’s language features proposed by Lakoff (1975) spoken by the man and woman main characters in movie “Music and Lyric”. They are: lexical hedges or fillers, tag question, rising intonation on declaratives, ‘empty’ adjective, intensifiers, hypercorrect grammar, super polite forms, the avoidance of strong swear words and emphatic stress. The ‘precise color term’ is not found in this movie neither spoken by the woman main character nor the man main character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The number of women’s language features spoken by the man and woman main characters were counted and compared. There is an interesting phenomena found that Mr. Alex Fletcher, the man main character in “Music and Lyric” movie use more women’s language features than the woman main character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition, there are factors caused this phenomena happened according to Coates theory (1986). They are: social status, subordinate groups, prestige and stigma, social network and the acquisition of sex differential language.</span></p>
