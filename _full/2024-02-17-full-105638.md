<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">This study explores the phenomenon of code-switching in the YouTube video “Maudy Ayunda Sempat Merasa Insecure Saat Berada di Stanford” uploaded by Boy William. The analysis focuses on the types of code switching employed in the conversation between the interviewer (Boy William) and the interviewee (Maudy Ayunda). The data were collected from the announcers utterances by (1) downloading the video (2) watching the related video repeatedly (3) taking notes on the dialogue that contains code switching, and (4) classifying. The writer using descriptive qualitative method. The theoretical framework, drawing from Hoffman (1991) and Grosjean (1982), provides the types and the reasons of code switching. The results of the analysis showed four types of code switching with the most shown namely Establishing Continuity frequency 18 with 43,9 %, while the least is Inter-sentential Switches frequency 4 with 9,7%.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, language plays a crucial role in our everyday lives. It’s the way we talk, write, and share thoughts, feelings, and information with people in our community or country. As our societies become more diverse with different languages, the interesting thing is how people seamlessly switch between them, a phenomenon called code-switching. Language is basically the key to communicating and connecting with others and in our increasingly multicultural world, code switching is becoming more common and fascinating. Pratiwi (2023) states that language can clearly and implicitly express human feelings and thoughts. Each form of written and spoken language can include speech sounds, words, sentences, and clauses, which can be configured into a larger form. The purpose of language is to get information from others through interaction. People can share their opinions, experiences, ideas and feelings in language. Language can be written, spoken or even in the form of gestures, but within language lies meaning. However, language is a complex human phenomenon as</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">English is taught in the Indonesian formal education system. Indonesia is a multilingual country with many ethnic groups speaking different languages. Speeches can be categorized into three types: First language, second language, and foreign language. A first language is called a person's mother tongue or mother tongue because it is the language that a person learns from birth. This mother tongue is the language that people use frequently in their daily life. A second language is a language that is learned after or after the native language of the speaker. A foreign language is a language spoken by the native speakers of a country, which is neither the official language of the person nor the language commonly spoken in the country. According to Noah Chomsky, language is the inherent ability of native speakers to comprehend and form grammatical sentences. In communication Code-switching can take place between any languages or dialects that the speaker is proficient in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Indonesians are pretty awesome at pronouncing foreign languages, effortlessly switching between two languages, and they’re even considered the best at it, especially with English. A code is divided into code mixing and code switching according to Stockwell (2002). According to Palmer in Adi (2018) code switching refers to the point at which people switch between different languages in the same contact process. According to Wardhaugh (2006), code switching is the use of different languages within the same discussion. In this study the writer takes the field of language related to sociolinguistics. The aim of this study is focused on analyzing the types of code switching using theory from Hoffman (1991). This linguistic phenomenon can be observed in a variety of contexts, from casual everyday interactions to formal settings, and it has important implications for our understanding of the use of language, perception, culture and identity. Code switching is a natural language behavior that occurs worldwide in bilingual and multilingual individuals. It reflects the complexity and flexibility of human language, as speakers deftly move between different language codes to meet the needs of their social and communicative environments. Whether switching between languages to express emotions, convey cultural specific nuances or fill lexical gaps, code switching is a powerful tool that reflects the dynamic interplay of languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As Myers-Scotton (2006) explains that we would say that bilingualism is the ability to use more than two languages or more than enough to hold a limited informal conversation. It means that a person is said to be bilingual if he can use that language in a short conversation. In addition, in this study as a data source, the researcher chose to use code switching of a Youtube video that uses two different languages, English and Indonesian. Hoffman (1991) points out four types of code switching based on association or range of transitions where language takes place, intra-sentential switches, inter-sentential switches, establishing continuity and emblematic switching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to conduct this study, there are two thesis and three articles were reviewed. First Inten (2019) from the English Study Program Faculty of Foreign Languages Mahasaraswati Denpasar University, completed a thesis named “Code Switching Found in Padang Bulan Novel by Andrea Hirata.” Second thesis is by Khairunnisa (2020) entitled “An Analysis of Code Switching used by English Tutor in Video Teaching Tutorial (TEATU) Kampung Inggris LC” this completed thesis is from English Education Study Program Tarbiyah and Teacher Training Faculty State Islamic University Raden Intan Lampung. And there will be three articles, the first article is entitled “Sociolinguistic Influence in the Use of English as a Second Language (ESL) Classroom: Seeing from OGO‟s Perspective” this completed article is written by Hasanah et all (2019) from ELYSA: Journal of English Language Studies. The second</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">articles is written by Fiorsera and Handayani (2021) entitled “Code Switching Used by Public Figures in Deddy Corbuzier‟s Podcast: Sociolinguistics Approach” from Journal Basis Vol. 8. The last articles is from Journal of Humanities, Social Science, Public Administration and Management (HUSOCPUMENT) written by Risweni et all (2021) entitled “Code Switching and Code Mixing in Negeri para Bebedah Novel”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The study of code switching is a diverse and dynamic field of study that explores the complex linguistic phenomenon of converting between two or more languages or languages in the same conversational context or communicates. This language practice is common in bilingual and multilingual communities around the world and has received considerable attention from linguists, sociologists, psychologists, and educators.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>METHOD AND THEORY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">This study uses descriptive qualitative method to analyze and describe of the purpose of using Code-switching in Youtube video </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Maudy Ayunda Sempat Merasa Insecure Berada di Stanford”</span><span class="font4"> uploaded by Boy William on 9<sup>th</sup> March 2020. The data were collected by downloading the youtube video, watching the youtube video repeatedly, taking notes the dialog that contains code switching and classifying the youtube video. Furthermore,in this study the data were classified according to Hoffman (1991) that describes four types of code switching based on the timing or magnitude of the switches that language occurs (1) Intra-sentential switches often occurs within the boundaries of clauses and sentences, each clause or sentence must be in a different code or language. (2) Inter- sentential is different from intra-sentential, it arises between a clause or sentence boundary, where each utterance is spoken in a different language. (3) Establishing continuity is the types of code switching that happens to ask the first speaker to continue their speech. (4) Emblematic switching, this type of code switching can be in the form of an exclamation point, inserting a specific group of words from a particular code into a sentence displayed in another language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the reason the writer used theory from Grosjean (1982). According to Grosjean (1982), code switching can also be used for many other reasons, such as quoting what someone has said (and thus emphasizing their group identity), specifying recipients (switching to the usual language of a particular person in a group will show that this person is being addressed), assessing what has been said or said about past events. The reason for distinguishing bilingualism from monolingual is a bilingual person who develops a bilingual system, while one monolingual develops a language system. Bilingual or multilingual speakers do not use both or all of their languages in all situations, there are certain situations in which they will use one language and in other situations use another. Grosjean (1982: 5) claims that bilingualism has always been a phenomenon in human history since language. Finding a company that is completely monolingual is really difficult. Origins of bilingualism have to do with very important factors. There are different reasons why people become bilingual and some of them are related to the movement that groups of bilinguals did so for political, social or economic reasons.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intra-sentential Switches</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Intra-sentential switches commonly happen within the boundaries of clauses and sentences, each clause or sentence must be in a different code or language. In this section discussed about the analysis of intra-sentential switches found in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the “Maudy Ayunda Sempat Merasa Insecure Berada di Stanford”</span><span class="font4"> Youtube video uploaded by Boy William used theory from Hoffman (1991).</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Data 1</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Boy </span><span class="font4">: “This is my first time bener-bener ada di pekarangan Stanford and I’m here with my family, ada Mario disini, ada Odelia show her, and Olivia right here and our other Friends Livy. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Kebetulan </span><span class="font4">kita semua di sini guys, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">we are all her friends here of </span><span class="font4">Maudy Ayunda, so </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I’m going to give you guys treat</span><span class="font4">”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Boy: </span><span class="font4">“Let’s go let’s go see Maudy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Minutes 0:13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the data above, the speaker continues to switch between Indonesian and English to convey their thoughts and share their experience at Stanford with friends and family. The code-switching occurs when Boy says, “This is my first time bener-bener ada di pekarangan Stanford and I’m here with my family, ada Mario disini, ada Odelia show her, and Olivia right here and our other Friends Livy”. Boy starts the sentence in English, describing his first time being at the Stanford campus and mentioning the presence of Mario, Odelia, Olivia, and their other friend, Livy. They use Indonesian words like “kebetulan” (coincidentally) and “kita semua di sini” (we are all here) while also incorporating English terms like “guys” and “treat” to maintain a connection with the audience. The analysis shows that the speaker uses code-switching to create more</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">dynamic conversation. This intra-sentential code-switching highlights how Boy naturally combines both languages to express himself in a fluid manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the provided conversation, Boy used intra-sentential switches to enhance his expression and communication in a more natural and effective manner. Boy’s use of the phrase “bener-bener” (really) in Indonesian adds emphasis to his statement that it’s his first time being at the Stanford campus. It provides a stronger sense of sincerity and genuine surprise, which might not be as effectively conveyed with an English equivalent. Boy also direct quoting and expression to switches back to English when he says, “we are all her friends here of Maudy Ayunda, so I’m going to give you guys treat.” Here, using English might lend a more direct and impactful tone to the statement.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Data 2</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Maudy: </span><span class="font4">“Orang-orang disini cinta banget sama matahari. Begitu matahari keluar dikit mereka langsung </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">go out and sitting on the grass</span><span class="font4">.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Boy</span><span class="font4">: “Beda banget sama orang Asia, begitu ada matahari langsung eh payung-payung”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(minutes 5:50)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the data above it can be seen that Maudy starts her sentence in Indonesian by saying, “Orang-orang disini cinta banget sama matahari” (People here really love the sun). However, she switches to English to say “Begitu matahari keluar dikit mereka langsung go out and sitting on the grass” (As soon as the sun comes out a bit, they immediately go out and sit on the grass). The switch to English might be influenced by the fact that she is describing a specific action, and using English helps her express it more precisely and concisely. Boy also starts his sentence in Indonesian by saying, “Beda banget sama orang Asia” (It's very different from Asian people). However, he switches to English to say “begitu ada matahari langsung eh payung-payung” (as soon as there’s sun, they immediately use umbrellas). The switch to English might be used for emphasis and humor, as the use of the English term “payung-payung” (umbrellas) adds a playful tone to his statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the data above both Maudy and Boy use intra-sentential switches to convey specific nuances, emphasize certain points, and potentially add cultural references. Maudy using English for the phrase “go out and sitting on the grass” might provide a more direct and clear expression of the action she is describing, which could be a common activity or concept in the context they are discussing. The term “payung-payung” might be a common expression in the local language for this behavior, and switching to Indonesian could capture the concept more effectively.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inter-sentential Switches</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Inter-sentential is different from intra-sentential, it arises between a clause or sentence boundary, where each utterance is spoken in a different language.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Data 3</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Boy</span><span class="font4">: “Because people here they have their own business </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">juga</span><span class="font4">”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Maudy</span><span class="font4">: “Yes! They are amazing you know? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Aku pun banyak minder</span><span class="font4">.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(minutes 5:20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the data above, in Boy’s sentence he code-switches from Indonesian to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">English. He starts the sentence in Indonesian by saying “Because people here” but then switches to English by adding “they have their own business juga” (also). The English phrase to express the idea more precisely or due to the influence of English in the speaker's daily life. In Maundy’s sentence, she switches from English to Indonesian. She starts her sentence in English by saying “Yes! They are amazing you know?” and then switches to Indonesian by adding “Aku pun banyak minder” (I also feel insecure). This code-switching could be used for emphasis or to express a sentiment more effectively in her native language. In this conversation demonstrates how bilingual speakers usemultiple languages to convey their thoughts and emotions more accurately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the data above both Boy and Maudy use intra-sentential switches to convey emphasis, familiarity, and certain nuanced meanings. Boy using “juga” (also) in Indonesian might add emphasis to the point Boy is making about people having their own business. The switch to Indonesian might emphasize this concept more effectively than using an English equivalent. And Maudy’s “amazing” in English might convey the sentiment more effectively and emotionally than its Indonesian equivalent. It could reflect Maudy’s enthusiasm and admiration for the people being discussed.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Data 4</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Boy</span><span class="font4">: “Are you a healthy person maudy?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Maudy</span><span class="font4">: “I exercise a lot, but food wise not really. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Apalagi anak kost juga kan</span><span class="font4">,I have to budget. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Kadang-kadang bikin sendiri manasin something, ga mungkin lah tiap hari makan salmon gitu</span><span class="font4">.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Boy</span><span class="font4">: “Hahaha </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">bangkrut</span><span class="font4">”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(minutes 11:30)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those sentences, can be categorized as inter-sentential switches because it’s occurs in two separate sentences in an utterance. In Boy’s sentence initiates the exchange with an English sentence, “Are you a healthy person, Maudy?” However, the subsequent responses from Maudy and Boy contain instances of inter-sentential switches. In Maudy sentence she blends English and Indonesian seamlessly to express the idea that, being a resident of a boarding house (anak kost), she has to be mindful of budgeting, especially when it comes to food choices. Boy's response, “Hahaha bangkrut” (Hahaha bankrupt), is an interjection in Indonesian, where he humorously responds to Maudy's statement about budgeting for food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Boy might use English here to add humor and playfulness to his response. The word “bangkrut” (bankrupt) is used humorously to suggest that Maudy’s budgeting approach might lead her to financial difficulties, and the inter-sentential switch to English might make the joke more effective. Using English for certain terms might add clarity and precision to Maudy’s response, especially when discussing a specific topic like health and budgeting. The switch could be for efficiency, using English for the specific health-related terms she is discussing, while using Indonesian for the rest of her response.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing Continuity</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Establising continuity is the types of code switching that happens to ask the first speaker to continue their speech.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Data 5</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Boy</span><span class="font4">: “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Kamu kalau </span><span class="font4">weekend what you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Maudy</span><span class="font4">: “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Biasanya tuh bisnisku banyak banget </span><span class="font4">travelling, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">jadi kemarin tuh kita ski</span><span class="font4">, ke park city. I learn to ski for the first time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(minutes 10:23)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this conversation, Boy initiates the conversation in Indonesian by asking Maudy what she usually does on weekends. Maudy responds with a mix of Indonesian and English, which helps establish continuity in the conversation and allows her to convey her experiences more effectively. The code-switching occurs when Maudy uses the phrase “Biasanya tuh bisnisku banyak banget travelling” (Usually, my business involves a lot of traveling) in Indonesian. Then, she continues with “jadi kemarin tuh kita ski, ke park city. I learn to ski for the first time” in English, the switch to English allows her to describe the activity more precisely and use skiing-related terms more naturally. By switching between languages, Maudy ensures that her response aligns with the question and allows her to express certain details more accurately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maudy code-switches to Indonesian when discussing her business travels (bisnisku banyak banget travelling). In this case, the concept of business travel is expressed more naturally and commonly in Indonesian, aligning with the idea of using the most suitable language for specific domains. The switch from English to Indonesian may reflect the principle of linguistic efficiency. Maudy might find it more efficient and effective to use Indonesian for discussing her business travel and skiing experience, as these topics are part of her personal and cultural background. By choosing the most appropriate language for each aspect of her response, she effectively conveys her thoughts and emotions while enhancing the natural flow of the conversation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Maudy</span><span class="font4">: “You know, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">intinya aku itu orangnya minderan</span><span class="font4">, very insecure. I think that a lot of that insecurity, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ngerasa kaya aduh masih banyak yang harus aku pelajarin, masih banyak yang harus aku resap dari pengalaman-pengalaman orang lain. </span><span class="font4">It’s the motivation, I wanna be a better person for myself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(minutes 6:42)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this conversation, Odelia asks Maudy what motivates her to do everything. Maudy responds with a mix of English and Indonesian, which allows her to express her thoughts and emotions more accurately and establish continuity in her response. The establishing continuity occurs when Maudy starts her response with “You know, intinya aku itu orangnya minderan, very insecure” (You know, basically, I'm a person who feels insecure, very insecure). She uses the Indonesian word “minderan” (feeling insecure) to convey her emotions effectively. Finally, she concludes with “It’s the motivation, I wanna be a better person for myself” in English. Here, she switches back to English to emphasize the motivation behind her actions. By switching between languages, Maudy ensures that her response is coherent and aligns with the topic of discussion, making her communication with Odelia more engaging and effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maudy switches from English to Indonesian to convey her emotional state and thoughts. She uses Indonesian to express her feeling of being “minderan” (insecure) and the sense that there is much she needs to learn and absorb from others' experiences. The switch to Indonesian could also be a matter of linguistic convenience, as certain thoughts and expressions are more naturally and easily formulated in one's primary</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">language.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Data 7</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Boy</span><span class="font4">: “Kalian semua saling kenal?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Maudy</span><span class="font4">: “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Saling kenal, karena kan </span><span class="font4">it’s such a small community. Jadi kita kaya biasanya punya perkumpulan PPI gitu. Kemarin aku bikin small group dinner sama temen-temen international aku terus aku masakin rendang, nasi liwet sama ayam goreng. They love it! </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Mereka kaget karena aku selalu bilang ‘aku gabisa masak’</span><span class="font4">”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(minutes 4:07)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this conversation, Boy asks if everyone knows each other. Maudy responds with a mix of Indonesian and English, which helps her establish continuity in her response and convey certain aspects more effectively. Maudy starts by saying “Saling kenal, karena kan it's such a small community” in Indonesian. Here, she switches to Indonesian to provide a direct and straightforward response to Boy’s question about whether they all know each other. The Indonesian phrases “saling kenal” means “know each other”. Finally, she concludes with “Mereka kaget karena aku selalu bilang aku gabisa masak (They were surprised because I always say I can’t cook) in Indonesian. She switches back to Indonesian to express her friends surprise at her cooking skills, using colloquial Indonesian expressions like “mereka kaget” (they were surprised) to capture the moment accurately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maudy switches to Indonesian when mentioning “perkumpulan PPI” (PPI group), a term that likely has cultural and contextual relevance. This aligns with Grosjean's idea that certain concepts or terms may be better expressed in one's native language. Switching to Indonesian for describing the dishes “rendang, nasi liwet, ayam goring” adds specificity and detail, capturing the essence of the traditional Indonesian meal more effectively. Maudy’s using each language to convey cultural nuances, specific details, and personal emotions in a way that best fits the context and enhances communication with her audience.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Data 8</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Boy</span><span class="font4">: “How many Indo kids sekarang?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Maudy</span><span class="font4">: “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Biasanya tuh yang keterima setiap tahun cuma 1, tapi sekarang karena ada yang keterima dari 2 tahun lalu. Ada aku sama temen aku satu lagi. Kalau underground ada 1 2 3 orang juga, tapi cuma dikit sih</span><span class="font4">.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(minutes 3:51)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the data above, Boy and Maudy use establishing continuity. This kind of code switching occurs to continue the utterance of the previous speaker. For example it can be seen in the dialog that Boy give a questions and Maudy continued the questions. Maudy starts her response by saying “Biasanya tuh yang keterima setiap tahun cuma 1” (Usually, only one gets accepted every year) in Indonesian. By switching to Indonesian, she directly addresses the usual number of Indonesian kids accepted annually. She continues with “tapi sekarang karena ada yang keterima dari 2 tahun lalu. Ada aku sama temen aku satu lagi” (but now, because some were accepted from two years ago.There’s me and one more friend) in Indonesian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maudy switches from Indonesian to English when discussing the specific number</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of “1, 2, 3 people.” Numerical details are often easily expressed in one's dominant language to ensure accuracy and precision. Using English for expressing the concept of “underground” which might be easier to convey directly in English, especially if it’s a concept that's often discussed in that language within her community.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emblematic Switching</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">In this type of code switching can be in the form of an exclamation point, inserting a specific group of words from a particular code into a sentence displayed in another language.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Data 9</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Maudy</span><span class="font4">: “Dulu aku kira bahwa aku tuh bahagia di Oxford and I was happy. Like compare how happy I am here, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">so different</span><span class="font4">”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Mario</span><span class="font4">: “What is one significant change that you can bring into this world. Itu salah satu pertanyaan yang harus dijawab untuk masuk di Stanford. Apa jawabanmu saat itu”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(minutes 14:34)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The phrase “so different” is used as an emblematic code-switch, which means that this particular expression is well-known, and it carries a specific meaning that is difficult to translate into the original language (Indonesian) without losing its impact or nuance. By using “so different” in English, Maudy conveys the idea that the level of happiness she experiences at her current location is markedly different from what she felt in Oxford. Emblematic code-switching often occurs when a phrase or expression from one language becomes iconic or symbolic in the speaker's mind, and they find it more fitting or impactful to use that expression as is, without translating it into the original language. It can also happen when certain phrases are commonly used in a specific context or among a particular group, and they become part of the speakers' linguistic repertoire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maudy switches from Indonesian to English when discussing her feelings of happiness and how they compare in different environments “Dulu aku kira bahwa aku tuh bahagia di Oxford and I was happy. Like compare how happy I am here, so different”. Expressing emotions and nuanced feelings in one’s dominant language can often capture the sentiment more accurately.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Data 10</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Boy</span><span class="font4">: “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Oh ya </span><span class="font4">by the way, for you to know, these cameramen people are maudy’s fans.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Maudy</span><span class="font4">: “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Oh ya? </span><span class="font4">It’s so sweet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(minutes 6:04)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the data above, the speaker involves the insertion of tag, interjection or sentence filler in the other language which serves an ethnic identity marker. They use English Tag such as “So, Oh”. The phrase “Oh ya” is used as an emblematic codeswitch, which means that it has become a recognizable and commonly used expression in this context or among the speakers. It serves as a way to introduce a new topic or to add additional information to the conversation. By using “Oh ya” in English, Boy conveys the informality and casualness of the topic he is about to share with Maudy. In this case, “Oh ya” may have become emblematic in the speaker’s interactions and is</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">used as a way to smoothly transition to a new subject or to interject with additional information. As for Maudy’s response, there is no instance of code-switching present. She replies in English, using the phrase “Oh ya? It’s so sweet” to acknowledge Boy's information about the cameramen being her fans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maudy switches from Indonesian to English to express her sentiment “It’s so sweet”. Certain emotional expressions, such as conveying sweetness or endearment, may be more naturally and effectively conveyed in one's dominant language.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">In the current era, many people can speak or understand English in a few words or sentences. The analysis of code-switching in various linguistic contexts has provided valuable insights into the complex dynamics of bilingual and multilingual communication. Therefore, code switching is now often used in everyday life and has even become a current trend. One of them is in the video </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Maudy Ayunda Sempat Merasa Insecure Saat Berada di Stanford”</span><span class="font4"> there is four types of code mixing according to Hoffman (1991) namely intra-sentential switches, inter-sentential switches, establishing continuity, and emblematic switching. The most frequently type of code switching in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Maudy Ayunda Sempat Merasa Insecure Berada di Stanford” </span><span class="font4">Youtube video uploaded by Boy William is Establishing Continuity frequency 18 with 43,9 %, while the least is Inter-sentential Switches frequency 4 with 9,7%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By understanding code switching, we gain valuable insights into how language shapes our social interactions, helps shape our identities, and serves as a vehicle for expression culture. This code-switching investigation sheds light on the complex workings of the human mind when it comes to language processing and demonstrates the inherent adaptability and creativity of bilingual and multilingual. Overall, future research on code-switching has the potential to contribute significantly to our knowledge of bilingual and multilingual communication, language contact, language acquisition, and the sociocultural aspects of language use.</span></p>
