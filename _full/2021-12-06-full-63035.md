The reseach subject were 18 Indonesian water ski athletes, which were divided into 2 periods with different treatment. Period I was given </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage treatment</span><span class="font1"> and Period II was given active resting treatment, 3 days break was occurred between treatments, so the research was conducted for 5 days.

The result in this reseach is obtained the average of lactic acid before active resting 7.29 ± 0.67 mmol/L, and after active resting is 4.41 ± 0.82 mmol/L. The differential test result of lactic acid before treatment between Period 1 and Period 2 is there is no significant difference with p=0.791 (p&gt;0.05). The decrease in the level of lactic acid between two periods by using </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paired sample t-test</span><span class="font1"> shows that p=0.01 (p&lt;0.05) which means the two periods have significant difference, from the difference in before and after </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage</span><span class="font1"> treatment is 4.1 ± 0.78 mmol/L, while the difference in before and after active resting treatment is 2.88± 0.54 mmol/L.

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Fatigue is a process of decreasing in tolerance to physical work. The cause is very specific which depends on the characteristic of the activity<sup>1</sup>.Excessive activity, lack of time in resting, weak physical condition, daily training and pressure can lead to fatigue<sup>2</sup>. Fatigue can be divided into two types, mental fatigue and physical fatigue. Mental fatigue is a fatigue as the effect of mental work, such as saturation because lack of interest. Meanwhile, physical fatigue is caused by physical or muscle activity<sup>3</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the sport with high internsity in a short duration, the fulfillment of energy needs is increased and almost a hundredfold. The accumulation of lactic acid &gt;&nbsp;19.5 mmol/L can cause fatigue<sup>1</sup>. Based on the previous reseach which is done by Purnomo, there is an increase of blood lactic acid in 5 minutes after maximum training<sup>4</sup>. Lactic acid in muscles will obstruct enzyme functions and disrupt the checimal reaction in muscles. This situation will disrupt muscles contraction becomes weak and as the result the muscles experiences exhaustion<sup>5</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fatigue can be minimized by optimalizing recovery. Recovery provides possibility for body to replenish energy, reduce lactic acid and reduce fatigue of central nerve system<sup>7</sup>. Recovery mechanism of lactic acid from muscles and blood is highly affected by kinds of activity and after maximum activity or anaerobic. This will affect the mechanism of lactate release from muscle to blood, increased blood flow, lactate uptake by the liver, heart and skeletal muscle<sup>8</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ways to fasten the recovery after experiencing fatigue are vary, one of them is by performing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage</span><span class="font1"> method. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sport massage</span><span class="font1"> is one of health massages which is provided to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">particular people who have healthy body, especially to athlete. This massage provides its effect that is to unleash blood circulation<sup>9</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Water ski sport is an anaerobic sport. Water ski has 3 kinds of sport event which are competed, if the athelete joins </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">overall</span><span class="font1"> so the athlete will join all events in a row with one day duration which affect to the accumulation of lactic acid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The activity which is categorized as anaerobic will increase the production and accumulation of lactic acid, which cause muscle exhaustion<sup>2</sup>. From the observation result of athelete condition who experienced fatigue, recovery familarizaton by performing observation and providing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage </span><span class="font1">is done to observe the effect of sport massage toward the reduction of fatigue. The problem is arising that not all water ski athletes, especially </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">overall</span><span class="font1"> sport event, understand about one of ways to reduce lactic acid level is by performing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage</span><span class="font1">. Related to the problem, the researcher has an intention to conduct a research entitled “The Effect of Sport Massage toward the Decrease of Fatigue”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Study design</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This research was conducted in Taman Buah Mekarsari, Bogor. The duration of research is 3 months, from November–Desember 2019. This research is an experimental study by using similar subject design (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">treatment by subject design)</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Subjects recruitment</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Subjects that were chosen to be participants of this research is all Indonesian overall waterski athletes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sampling technique</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The sampling techniques in this research is with total sampling. The number of samples was 18 who were given intervention in Period I and Period II. In Period I was provided with sport massage and in Period II was active resting. This research was conducted for 5 days with 3 days of washing out periode in between Period.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Material and Procedure</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Accutrend Lactacid is used as the measurement tool to measure the level of blood lactic acid Accutrend Lactacyd does not have validity and reliability scores. However, this tool is standardized and meets the validity standard to be used to track lactic acid levels and Stopwatch is used to measure the duration time while the treatment is performed. Furthermore, in measuring temperature while performing the treatment use Thermometer and other equipments needed for massage, such as mat, towel and lubricant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Asking for agreement to the sample is done by providing oral explanation about the purpose and objectives of research and authorization which was provided for the sample. When conducting the research, on the first day of the sample, a water race simulation was carried out for all sports competitions arranged by the coach, followed by a pre-test of blood lactic acid levels by health workers with tools provided by researchers in the form of Accutrend Lactacyd, needles for blood collection, and sterile cotton. After that, a sports massage is given for 30 minutes and performed by a certified massage therapist. A post-test is performed for the following treatments to collect blood samples to determine lactic acid levels after treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The sample is given a break for 72 hours based on the theory stated above until the sample is taken back after the activity. On day 4, the sample repeated the simulation competition as instructed by the trainer and continued with a pre-test of blood lactic acid levels using the same tool on the first day. The sample was then subjected to an active rest (jogging) for 30 minutes by the trainer and after that a post test of blood lactic acid levels was carried out. The overall results are provided in the table.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Effect of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sport Massage</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Towards the Decrease of Lactic Acid Level</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the analysis result, it shows that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sport Massage</span><span class="font1"> impacts the decrease of lactic acid level. The average level of lactic acid before doing the sports massage period was 7.2333 mmol / L while after the sports massage period was 3.1333 mmol / L. Lactic acid is a result of carbohydrate metabolism without using oxygen (anaerob metabolism).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lactic acid is produced in muscle cells when there is insufficient oxygen supply to support energy production. According to Soekarman “in high intensity physical training, the muscles contract in anaerobic state, so that the provision of ATP occurs through the process of glycolysis. While training, pyruvate is formed”<sup>10</sup>. If the oxygen supply is not fulfilled to break down pyruvate, then lactate is produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lactate enters the muscle, tissue and blood cells. The reduction of pyruvate to lactic acid is the final reaction of glycolysis and this reaction is called as “dead end” which means lactic acid cannot be further catabolized. After being produced, lactic acid can leave the cell, accumulate in sell or dioxide to pyruvate due to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lactate Dehydrogenase</span><span class="font1"> (LDH) enzyme which is reversible<sup>11</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This lactic acid will wait for the muscle to become aerobic to be converted again into pyruvic acid by cells in muscle tissue or in the spleen and liver<sup>12</sup>. An activity that can accelerate lactate recovery is an increase in oxidation and gluconeogenesis process, which involves a lot of red muscle fibers and accelerates the distribution of lactate to the liver<sup>13</sup>. Based on the research conducted by Falks is that the important things of lactic recovery are improve blood circulation, cardiac output and lactic transport to boost and form back energy. The duration of recovery is conducted by improving the consumption of O2. This situation keep processing until there is an enough amount of ATP formed to contract again. Providing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage</span><span class="font1"> method helps smoothen blood circulation and the rest of the metabolites return to normal levels. Therefore, the provison of energy source and its fuel will be assured. The statement is supported by the research which is conducted by Bale and James in Colleen Cupido, that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage</span><span class="font1"> can improve the decrease of blood lactic acid level compared to normal resting<sup>14</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Manipulation which is carried out from the body to the heart in mechanical way is done to push blood flow in the veins to the heart<sup>15</sup>. It is supported by the statement of Hipocrate which states massage towards the heart, starts from the feet upwards, while from above which is the head or neck down towards the heart. This is an evidence that there is a scientific basic for doing massage. Providing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage</span><span class="font1"> is an artificially activating venous pump mechanism and lymph pump to speed up recovery through accelerating circulation in a state of complete rest (relaxed lying).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Activation of venous and lymph pumps occured in dynamic muscle contraction (isotonis) by alternating contraction and relaxation of muscles<sup>3</sup>. When the muscles contract, the veins in and around the veins are squeezed, so that blood and lymph are squeezed out of the vessels, then during relaxation, the vessels are filled again with blood and lymph from the active muscle tissue, not from blood and lymph that had been squeezed out. The recent research which was done by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Buck Institute </span><span class="font1">for Aging Research in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">McMaster University,</span><span class="font1"> Ontario shows that massage can reduce inflammation and improve the growth of new mitochondria, which is energy-producing units in cells. Meanwhile, </span><span class="font0">158</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">mitochondria are a cell respiration tool which needs oxygen. Therefore, the more oxygen produced, the more the growth of new mitochondria. The research is supported by a research conducted by Justin Crane where the cells which obtained massage can improve mitochondria. Furthermore, the muscles which are being massaged show less inflammation.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Effect of Active Resting Towards the Decrease of Lactic Acid Level</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">From the reseach result, it shows the decrease of blood lactic acid level in active recovery. The average change of lactic acid level in before and after is 2.8828. It is due to the simple activity which helps blood circulation has a purpose to fasten the movement of lactic acid from muscles to liver which then converted into glucose via circulation. The recovery with low intensity significantly recure the lactic acid which is accumulated in the muscles and fasten the recovery. Active resting is one of effective recoveries to improving the speed of blood flow through the working muscular system<sup>16</sup>so the transport of lactic acid accumulated in the muscles is also more optimal<sup>17</sup>. Active resting will be beneficial, if the previous pressuse is not exhausting. Active resting can decrease the accumulation of lactic acid, but still performing an activity with low intensity<sup>18</sup>. Active resting and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage</span><span class="font1"> have similar advantages; however, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">massage</span><span class="font1"> can reduce the level of anxiety and stress,<sup>19</sup> so body is comfortable after recovery<sup>19</sup>. The comfortable feeling affects low level of fatigue after traning<sup>20</sup>.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">From the result of analysis, it reveals that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage</span><span class="font1"> and active resting has similar sig. 0.000, which can be defined that the two treatments affect the decrease of lactic acid level. However, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage</span><span class="font1"> is more effective than active resting. It is proven from the difference of value average in before and after of lactic acid level after the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage</span><span class="font1"> treatment is greater than in active resting. Both treatments, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage</span><span class="font1"> and active resting have similar effects, but </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sport massage</span><span class="font1"> can decrease the level of anxiety and stress,<sup>19</sup> where the body feels comfortable after recovery with massage treatment<sup>21</sup>.
