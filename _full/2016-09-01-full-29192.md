<p><span class="font6">A new type of revegetation sheet which also has a function of soil erosion control was applied to the expansive clay soil slope in West Java, Indonesia, and the function of the sheet to reduce the collapse of the slope was examined. Firstly, it was identified that the soil in the test construction site was a typical expansive clay soil mainly consisting of smectite and quartz according to the X-ray diffraction analysis. Secondly, as a result of monitoring up to 13 months after the application of the sheet, it was observed that the sheet successfully controlled soil erosion and led to gradual vegetation recovery, despite the fact that the construction area is in a part of tropical monsoon climate where the rainy and the dry seasons come repeatedly in a year and the soil swells in rainy season and shrinks and forms crack in dry season. Therefore, it was indicated that as the recovery of vegetation went by, the effect of controlling soil erosion, land slide and slope collapse would be increased.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In order to prevent the cut and fill slopes made by the road construction etc. from causing the soil erosion and the landslide by heavy rain, a newly developed revegetation sheet, which makes the rainwater drain</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">out effectively and realizes the revegetation in parallel, has been spotlighted and successfully applied to a variety of fields in Japan for the last two decades<sup>1)</sup>. The new type sheet consists of two materials, i.e.; the polyester non-woven fabric with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ISSN ONLINE: 9 772303 337 008</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">porosity of 97 to 98% and the polyethylene net for protection, and allows the reached rainwater to drain out smoothly through the non-woven fabric while the fine fibers of nonwoven fabric grab the soil surface tightly. Because of its structure, the sheet prevents the soil erosion. The new type sheet also allows the germinated plant beneath of the sheet to penetrate the porosity rich fabric to realize the revegetation successfully (Yamamoto and Marumoto, 2012)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The extraordinary weather in present days due to the climate change causes heavy rain which often brings a great disaster such as a large-scale slope collapse and a debris flow in Japan. With regard to the function of the new type sheet for erosion control, it has been demonstrated that it smoothly drains out the rainwater even under the condition of precipitation amount of 100mm/hr and suppresses the rainwater infiltration into soil and is applicable to the preventive measure against causing the debris flow under the condition according to the large scale experiment (Matsumoto </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of its high performance for soil erosion control as well as</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">revegetation, the new type sheet has been further tested or applied to demonstrate the applicability of the sheet under other particular conditions in foreign countries, such as the mud stone in Taiwan (Chuang, 1993), the scoria soil in Bali, Indonesia (Kayo </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 2015), and the vulnerable sand stone mixed with the gravel in Kingdom of Bhutan (Iwasa, 2017), and it is being ascertained that the new type sheet is effective to controlling the soil erosion and recovering the vegetation in the countries or the regions where the landslide disaster is a serious problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Next, a new challenge that is application of the new type sheet to the expansive clay soil slope was planned. The expansive clay soil generally contains a lot of clay minerals such as smectite etc. and it swells and shrinks depending on the water content in soil and then the volume changes largely. According to Soil Taxonomy by Department of Agriculture, United States (USDA), the soil is categorized into Vertisol (Soil Taxonomy, 1999). Vertisol, which is an expansive clay soil, occupies 2.4% of the ice-free area and are distributed in the world including</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Indonesia. According to Global Soil Regions in Soil Taxonomy, the expansive clay soil can be found in Java, Timor, Lombok, Sumbawa, Sumba and Flores islands in Indonesia. In Java Island, the soil is distributed in many areas of East Java and in relatively many areas in Central Java and West Java. In West Java, the soil is specifically distributed in the areas of Padalarang, Plered, Cikampek, Cikarang, Karawang and Bukit Indah City. As the shear stress of the soil in these areas is high even under the natural soil water content, the cut slope stands firmly just after cutting, however it starts to fail as a certain time goes by (Raharjo, 2014). Moreover, this type of soil also affects the soil bearing capacity and causes the slope instability and the damage to buildings, roads and the other infrastructures (Raharjo, 2014; Zakaria </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now, Japanese industrial estates such as MM2100, GIIC, KIIC etc. have been developed in West Java and those are facing at a serious problem of swelling soil and causing numerous cracks. However, an effective method which fulfills both the cost and the effect has not been found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the new type sheet has both functions of controlling the soil erosion and revegetation, examining the application of the sheet to such expansive clay soil slope is valuable. Therefore, in the areas where the soil makes the ground unstable, the application of the new type sheet was examined in terms of the effect of draining out rainwater and preventing the soil from swelling and cracking through more than a year long monitoring on four test sites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">MATERIALS AND METHODS</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Soil analysis</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">On 20<sup>th</sup>, February, 2014, two soil samples were taken from the upper and the lower sites in A site inside GIIC in Cikarang, Bekasi, West Java, Indonesia and the soil were analyzed to investigate some characteristics of the soil. pH(H</span><span class="font3">2</span><span class="font7">O) and EC for two soil samples, soil particle size, soil particle density, liquid limit, plastic limit and clay mineral composition for one soil sample in the lower site were analyzed. pH(H</span><span class="font3">2</span><span class="font7">O) was analyzed with pH meter (HORIBA, Ltd., F-52) after the supernatants were extracted with de-ionized water at the ratio of 2.5 times more than dry soil weight. EC</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ISSN ONLINE: 9 772303 337 008</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">was analyzed with EC meter (DKK-TOA CORPORATION, CM-30G) after the supernatants were extracted with de-ionized water at the ratio of 5 times more than dry soil weight. Soil particle size, soil particle density and both liquid limit and plastic limit were analyzed by JIS A 1204, JIS A 1202 and JIS A 1205 respectively. Clay mineral composition was analyzed by means of both the whole rock approach and the clay fraction approach using X-ray powder diffraction.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">From February, 2014 to January, 2015, the sheets (Takino Filter sheet SP-60 by Takino Filter Inc.) were covered on the developed cut slopes in GIIC, West Java, Indonesia (Table 1). In the test constructions, the sheets with the non-woven fabric made of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Acryl for A site and Polyester for all sites except A site were used respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On 10<sup>th</sup>, March, 2015, the soil erosion control and vegetation conditions were investigated by the visual observation in both the sheet plot and the neighbor bare plot. Some level differences in the border line between the sheet covered plot and the neighbor bare plot at several points were measured with the measuring tape to evaluate the soil erosion control effect quantitatively by the sheet. In the C site, just after the construction on 5<sup>th</sup>, December, 2014, the level differences in three points of upper, middle and lower each part inside two quadrats of 1 meter square set up to divide into equal parts of the sheet and another similar sheet were measured.</span></p>

While, the sand and the gravel fractions were 13.0% and 0.7% respectively, so that the coarse particle fraction was less and the soil was categorized into fine particle clay soil. While, the plasticity index was 93.36 and it was indicated that the soil has high viscosity. According to the plasticity chart which shows the relationship between the plasticity index and the liquid limit, the soil was categorized into the clay soil with high liquid limit (Table 2).</span></p>

In the site near GIIC, smectite, quartz and kaolinite were detected as a result of the whole rock approach using X-ray diffraction (Kumitsu and Katakami, 2013).

Level differences in the border line between the new type sheet covered plot and the neighbor bare plot in the upper and lower parts of slope were 6.0cm and 11.0cm respectively, so that the latter was</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">bigger than the former because the latter was steeper than the former (Figure 18). In another similar sheet covered plot, the non-woven fabric and many bamboo skewers were run off</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">and the soil surface was bared and the soil which had been run off by rainfall was accumulated in the under part of slope as well as in C site (Figure 19).</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In the bare plot, the vegetation rate was 10%, but the vegetation rates in the upper and the lower parts of slope covered with both the new type sheet and another similar sheet were 20% and 5% respectively (Figure 20 and 21). From the result, it was considered that the invading plants of the flied and buried seeds had established and grown easily in the upper part of slope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to the weather data in Bekasi, West Java, Indonesia, total precipitation for 2 months from January, 2015 to February, 2015 was 536mm and the temperature was 28 to 33 degrees Celsius and the average temperature was 31.0 degrees Celsius<sup>10)</sup>.</span></p>
