<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A notary and Land Deed Making Officer (PPAT) is an institution mentioned in the Civil Code with the authority to make authentic deeds. As with other institutions, Notaries and PPATs need an information system to help improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the agency's services. Therefore, this research was conducted to produce an information system that can assist in the management process, monitoring, and reporting on services performed by Notaries and PPATs. This research was conducted by utilizing the Waterfall method as a development method which produced 5 modules, including the Employee Data Management Module, Client Data Management Module, Authentication Management Module, PPAT and Notarial Services Module, and Reporting Module, and has been tested using the Blackbox Testing Method. and the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) which shows that this system can work well and is effective with an overall test score of 1.27.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Technological developments that are competitively increased require users always to follow the flow of digitalization to facilitate needs in various fields that are increasingly complex. As a supporting factor, information technology is expected to enable users in multiple areas, especially data management activities [1]. One form of clear evidence of the significant influence of technology is the existence of a web-based information system capable of processing and presenting data effectively, quickly, and accurately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An information system is an interconnected component to collect, store, and distribute information to support an organization's decision-making [2]. Information systems in business processes are one of the factors that facilitate the improvement of the quality of information, so it is the primary function area in managing business administration [3].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Notarial Office (NO) and Land Deed Making Officer (PPAT) in Indonesia is an institution mentioned in the Civil Code with authority for authentic deeds. In carrying out their duties and administrations, Notaries and PPAT officials need data management that is managed and monitored correctly. Doing an original act that needs to go through a series of complicated processes and requirements that sometimes requires a unique mechanism to monitor the alignment of the process with established procedures [4].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, until now, it is not uncommon to find Notarial offices and PPATs still using manual recording and reporting. That things trigger various obstacles in the Notarial and PPAT service process, such as the slow service process due to the lack of employee performance monitoring facilities, and the files collected are prone to damage. In addition, creating the files required as a condition for doing an authentic deed is also often still done manually by typing the necessary information from the file one by one, significantly slowing down the process because the required files are not small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These management constraints require an information system solution that can help data management from the Notarial Office and PPAT so that their services can run more effectively and efficiently. That kind of management problem is the background for this research, so it can help with data management and reporting constraints for the Notarial Office and PPAT by utilizing a website-based information system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Website-Based Service Management and Reporting Information System at the Notarial Office and PPAT is expected to be a solution because it has several features, such as a service process monitoring feature to help overcome delays in the service process. This feature will make it easier for Notarial and PPAT officials to determine the best solution for a service problem immediately. In addition, this system also has reporting features in the form of dashboards and automatic report printing that can be used to monitor Notarial and PPAT office service statistics and to help provide periodic reports quickly and efficiently. Finally, this system also has an automatic service file printing feature, making it easier for staff to prepare service files.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method / Proposed Method</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Several supporting hardware and software are used to support the implementation and testing in this study. The hardware used is ASUS TUF Gaming FX505GE with Intel Coffee Lake Core i7-8750H CPU with a processing speed of around 2.20 GHz accompanied by support for GPU Nvidia Geforce GTX 1050 4 GB, RAM 88192 MB, SSD of 128 GB, HDD 1 TB, 64-bit Operating System Windows 11, x64-based processor. As well as Windows 11 Home operating system software, Visual Studio Code, XAMPP Control Panel, SQLyog Ultimate – MySQL GUI v13.1.1 (64-bit).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The research method applied in this study is the development of the waterfall method. The waterfall method is a systematic and sequential information system development model [5]. The result of this system using the Waterfall model is made by following a series of processes.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/105606-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:153pt;height:275pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1 Research Method with Waterfall Development Scheme</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a research method that implements the Waterfall development scheme. System design and development begins with the process of collecting data in the form of interviews, observations, and literature [6]. Next, the system development process is carried out using the Waterfall development method, namely through four stages of development. After the development stage has been carried out well, the research will end with making a report.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">The general description of the system to be designed is helpful as a reference for modeling the system as a whole to make it easier to provide information on how the system will be formed. The general description of the Service Management Information System and Website-Based Reporting at the Notarial Office and PPAT is as follows.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/105606-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:390pt;height:143pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Figure 2. System General Overview</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overviews the Service Management Information System and Website-Based Reporting at the Notarial Office and PPAT. This general description shows that this system will later be accessed through the website by two entities, namely staff and Notarial and PPAT officials, where all system data is stored in the database. Notarial and PPAT officials can use the system to monitor the service process carried out by staff.</span></p></li></ul><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/105606-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:366pt;height:241pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Figure 3 Use Case Diagram</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a Use Case Diagram of a Website-Based Service Management and Reporting Information System at a Notarial Office and PPAT. Use Case Diagram can be defined as a system modeling which describes the list of functions and ownership rights of existing functions [7]. Two actors can access or become targets for system users, namely staff and Notarial and PPAT officials. Generally, the two actors can access several system models, including Authentication Management, Customer Data Management, Notarial Service Data Management, PPAT Service Data Management, and Reporting. Meanwhile, Staff Data Management and Staff Service Notifications can only be accessed by Notarial and PPAT officials as the system admin.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">After the system has been successfully developed, all features or menus will be tested to detect errors or deficiencies using the Blackbox and Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Black Box testing is a software quality test that focuses on software functionality. Black Box testing aims to find incorrect functions, interface, data structure, performance, initialization, and termination errors [8].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) is designed to assess and evaluate user satisfaction with a computer system or application. The PSSUQ question items yield four scores, one overall and three subscales. These values include System Quality (SysQual) which is a subscale that evaluates system quality, Information Quality (InfoQual) subscale that is used to assess information quality, Interface Quality (IntQual) subscale that is used to evaluate interface quality, and overall, which is a value the average of the entire subscale [9]. PSSUQ Version 3 consists of 16 questions with seven options (+ NA option). The question below shows a PSSUQ questionnaire to measure the usability of a website.</span></p>
