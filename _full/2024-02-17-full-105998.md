<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conjunction are crucial for connecting word, phrases, or clauses in a sentence, enhancing coherence and facilitating smooth communication. The aim of this study is to analyze the types and functions of conjunctions in the novel entitled The Target by David Baldacci. The study uses descriptive qualitative method by using theory from Halliday and Hassan with different years. By using the theory of Halliday and Hassan (1976) to analyze the types of conjunctions, and the theory of Halliday and Hassan (1985) to analyze the functions of conjunctions. .. The result of this study shows that the additive type of conjunction has the highest and most dominant occurrence which is forty-three times (61,5%) in the use of conjunction. Because additive conjunction are more often used in a sentences in novrl such as conjunction “and” and “or” The abstract is not well organised so it’s hard for me to follow.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Conjunction is essential for communication because it serves as a link or relationship between clauses. In communication people use conjunction, both in spoken language and written language Sulistyaningsih &amp;&nbsp;Slamet (2018). As stated by Wifda &amp;&nbsp;Sholichah (2021) mastering grammar helps communication between others. Some circumstances, that connection of conjunction has a significant pattern to convey action in a clear context. According to Halliday and Hasan (1976:227) the conjunction links the words together, giving the phrase coherence. In other words, a conjunction allows one to infer a conjunction of one or more word. In other words, a conjunction allows one to infer a conjunction of one or more words (Friston et all, 2005). In novels and other literary works, conjunction is used to connect words to one another or to other texts. Wallek &amp;&nbsp;Warren (1948: 21). Another viewpoint on conjunctions is provided by Mather &amp;&nbsp;Jaffe (2022: 1), by using a particular connecting word or phrase, conjunction establishes a semantic relation by expressing how a clause or relation is tied to a prior clause or statement. Based on Huddleston &amp;&nbsp;Pullum (2005) Where the use of grammar</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">is crucial, presenting an attempt to develop a new framework for analysis. In novels and other literary works, conjunction is used to connect one word to another. Cohesive acts as a tie between clauses or sections of text in such a way as to give a meaningful pattern between each other (Bloor and Bloor 1995:980). Cohesion refers to the surface-level grammatical and lexical components of a text that might create linkages between different sections of the text Tanskanen &amp;&nbsp;Benjamins (2006). Because it connects sentences and paragraphs together in distinct units and enables the reader to understand the content properly, the connecting link is regarded as the most crucial cohesive device Amayreh &amp;&nbsp;Abdullah (2022). By using a particular connecting word or phrase, conjunction establishes a semantic relation by expressing how a clause or relation is tied to a prior clause or statement. Language, which can be expressed orally or in writing, is the most distinguishing aspect of human activity and the most significant method of human communication Rakasiwi (2020). In our daily lives, language can be used for lots of objectives Yani (2021). A high level of structure in language, manifested through the elaboration of phrases, nouns, sentence nominalization and embedding techniques for segmentation and clauses Schleppegrell (2001). Conjunction establishes connections between phrases reference establishes referential chains connections between elements to establish cohesiveness Mohammed (2015) In novels and other literary works, conjunction is used to connect one word to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This study focused to analyse the types and functions of conjunction. By emphasizing the function of conjunctions is not only a connecting word in a sentence used in reading descriptions, but also can combine words with phrases, clauses with clauses, and clauses with phrasesThis study discusses conjunctions, where conjunctions contribute to connecting ideas and contribute to the flow of discussion by linking related thoughts, emphasizing relationships, or contrasting points. Conjunctions help create coherence and guide the reader or listener through a logical progression of information, , with emphasis of this research is on determining the function of conjunctions that are used in the conversations of the characters in the novel &quot;The Target,&quot; wherein conjunctions are not just used to join sentences or words together but also to determine the function of conjunctions that each use of the conjunction has a meaning behind it. Thus, this research can be said to be different from previous research because previous research analyzed conjunctions in reading descriptions only, while this research analyzes the conversation in the characters in the novel which contains the hidden meaning behind the characters' utterances. Two hundred pages in this novel are used to analyze the data. Conjunction talks about some fundamental English concepts. According to the findings, the frequently used conjunctions show that still in writing conjunctions are usually used to connect ideas in spoken as well as written language (Schleppegrell, 1996: 272). The most important ability is knowing how to use a conjunction, which in English can.The introduction should deal with what discussion related to the topic is going on and how your study contributes to the discussion. Add this information in the introduction.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>METHOD AND THEORY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">This research is taken from the novel entitled &quot;The Target&quot; by David Baldacci. The greatest killer in the US government, Will Robie, and his accomplice Jessica Reel are featured in this suspenseful mystery book as they take on a dangerous mission for the president. The third series of the novel used as data released in 2014. Will Robie is the main character. Conjunction is analysed in this research. To collect the data, the researcher collected the data using an observational approach by reading, underlining,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and categorizing them into types of conjunctions using the theory of Halliday and Hassan (1976) and functions of conjunctions using the theory of Halliday and Hassan (1985) by using the data in the description of the novel The Target. The data is presented with descriptive qualitative method. Where this method refers to the usual and natural data analysis without any manipulation, to describe it in the form of words or sentences. The result presented formally to show the types of conjunction. Informal by describing the many kinds of conjunction. According to research conducted by Sutasoma (2022) finds many additive types of conjunctions, it is also the same as the results from previous researchers conducted by Pasaribu (2019), and Mahadewi (2022). The other findings found more dominant types of coordinating conjunctions based on Nita (2020), Situmorang (2022). Theou results of research conducted by Sutasoma (2022), Mahadewi (2022), and Pasaribu (2019), stated that they analysed four types of conjunctions. Contrary to Nita (2020) and Situmorang (2022) which shows the existence of two types of conjunctions. Meanwhile, Mahadewi’s research (2022) finds data by finding four types of conjunctions but did not explain how many percentages used a table of conjunction types which would make it easier for readers to know the results of her research. Based on Sutasoma (2022) conjunction plays an important role, it acts as a link or connection between one clause to another while Mahadewi (2022) conjunction is linking the sentence including the expression which is used. From these two opinions, it can be stated that conjunction is a connecting word that connects one sentence with another sentence.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>RESULT AND DISCUSSION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">In this part, the author offers data collected from David Baldacci’s novel entitled The Target and applies Halliday and Hassan (1976) to examine and conduct the types of conjunction. This study also analyses the function of conjunction states of theory from Halliday and Hassan (1985). By using description in the novel “The Target”. The conclusion is based on David Baldacci's The Target Novel's four conjunction types and twelve conjunction functions. In this novel, there were 70 data that can be classified as types and functions of conjunction. The types and function of conjunction can be seen in the table below:</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font4">The numbers in the table provide a quantitative overview of the distribution of types and functions of conjunctions. The higher percentage (61.5%) of additive conjunctions implies their frequent use in combining elements with a grammatical structure. Meanwhile, the lower percentages for adversative, causal, and temporal conjunctions suggest a comparatively lesser occurrence, shedding light on the relative</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">importance of each type in the context studied. The specific counts and percentages contribute valuable insights into the prevalence and significance of different conjunction types and functions in the discussion. As shown in the table above, there are 70 data of types and functions of conjunctions. Of the data classified as types of conjunctions, there are 43 (61.5%) data that are the most for additive conjunctions, this happens because it emphasizes the function of the additive type as a conjunction that is often used in combining sentences, phrases, clauses, which have a grammatical structure, followed by the adversative type with a total of 8 (11.5%), and for causal totaling 8 (11.4%), and the last is the least appearing temporal relation which amounts to 6 (8.5%). Meanwhile, there are two functions of conjunction simple temporal relation as much as 3 (4.2%) with the greatest number of occurrences, and followed by adversative relation (proper) with the number of occurrences of 2 (2.8%) found in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Target Novel</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Additive</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Think about the cohesive relations, which are a combination of the &quot;and&quot; type and the &quot;or&quot; type, two structural interactions that take the form of coordination and are classified together under the additive category.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Stated from Halliday and Hassan (1976:245). When and is used alone as a cohesive item, as distinct from and then, etc, it often seems to have the sense of ‘there is something more to be said from the previous sentence’. The sentences that the types can be seen below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Data 1 </span><span class="font4">(David Baldacci, 2014: 5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Earl &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: You know why I’m here?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Nurse : Let's see.Cause you're </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">the state of Alabama won't releasesomeone like you to secure hospice even if you are costing them a ton of money in medical bills?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The conversation took place at a prison where Earl is a murderer, was being treated by a nurse for cancer while an inmate. In this situation, the nurse who has checked Earl's condition and wants to get out, before the nurse turns away Earl asks why he is here and the nurse answers him with a smirked face. Then, the nurse wants to tell even if Earl pays for a large treatment in the hospital no one will want to treat criminals like him. The data consists of conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font4"> refers to the additive conjunction from the conversation, in the sentence that The Nurse said: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cause you're dying and the state of Alabama won’t release someone like you to secure hospice even if you are costing them a ton of money in medical bills?</span><span class="font4"> The data in this novel of conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font4"> there emphasizes the function that is not just a connective word. Sutasoma (2022) found the additive conjunction “and” which emphasizes the function of and only as a word, phrase, and clause connection. However, the nurse wants that it is not just the state of Alabama that does not release people as bad as Earl but she wants to show that all parts of the state of the conjunction. The conjunction and in this data can connect two situations, namely where Earl is a criminal or murderer in the second situation Alabama will not let the murderer roam even when he gets sick there will be no hospital that accepts to treat him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Data 2 </span><span class="font4">(David Baldacci, 2014: 7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TheNurse : Presbyterians? What the hell have they ever done to you, Earl? That'slike hating the Amish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Earl &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Jews </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">coloreds mostly</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the novel, the above conversation takes place in prison. The nurse asks about his murder case and how he is and looks at Earl with an amused tone about how he killed Presbyterians and hates why he is Amish. Earl replied by shrugging his shoulders and wiping the sweat from his forehead with his sheet. This conversation talks about Earl to repent and not become a murderer again. The conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font4"> in the conversation above, the first sentence above mentions that, squealed like hogs getting butchered, swear to God they did, followed by the second sentence, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jews and coloreds mostly</span><span class="font4">, which emphasizes the function of the conjunction, that means conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font4"> there explains the meaning of the first sentence by informing Jews and who coloreds mostly. Based on Sutasoma (2022) which emphasizes the function of conjunction types as a connective binder, connecting clauses, phrases, words. In this data which emphasizes the function of conjunction types, emphasizing that conjunctions can also be used in conversation and have meaning behind the conversation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The external and internal plans can be distinguished more clearly with or, relation in terms of the fundamental meaning of which conjunctive or relation is alternative. Some components of the application of or, such as those used in the following sentences, are included in the data source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Data 3 </span><span class="font4">(David Baldacci 2014: 8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Earl &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: No. I killed my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TheNurse : Why'd you do that? Were they Jews </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font4">Presbyterians or coloreds?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The conversation above takes place in the morning in prison, the field when the nurse gives medicine to Earl, a cancer patient who is imprisoned for murder. Earl said that there were many people who wanted to see him. The nurse replied with a smile what is your family, I have killed my family added Earl. The mode here aims to make Earl aware of himself and repent immediately. The conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font4"> is used here with the implication that the nurse really wants to know the background of why he killed his family by instructing him to choose between the causes with Jews and Presbyterians in the conversation where the nurse who took care of Earl asks, as explained in the first conversation by Earl, why he did it because he was Jews </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font4"> Presbyterians. The conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font4"> above shows the same function, namely as the cause of an action and provides an explanation of one fact with another fact, as explained clearly by Sutasoma (2022: 29)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Adversative</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Based on Halliday and Hassan (1976: 250) Adversative is a relationship that runs counter to what is expected, the types are however, yet, but.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The conjunction &quot;but&quot; is employed to connect two statements that are identified &quot;contradictory&quot; because of their many interpretations. The adversative conjunction typically signifies the sense of &quot;contrary to expectation&quot;. This conjunction expresses the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">notion of &quot;as against&quot; and therefore has an external aspect. For the example on the below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Data 4 </span><span class="font4">(David Baldacci 2014: 6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Nurse : This is Alabama, after all. A liberal win here hell freezes over. Am I right?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Earl &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">But </span><span class="font4">I'm from Georgia, son. I'm a Georgia peach, see?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the examples of the data above, the conversation took place when the nurse examined Earl. She informed him that his mother and father are also divided and Republican Party supporters include Alabama, and that if the liberals win this place, hell will freeze. Earl inquired as to whether or not this was accurate. The conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">but </span><span class="font4">belongs to the adversative. In the conversation above, Earl says the conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">but</span><span class="font4"> to explain the next sentence, namely </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I'm from Georgia, son. I'm a Georgia peach, see? </span><span class="font4">with the meaning in the sentence the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">but</span><span class="font4"> explains that he wants to convince the nurse that he is really a Georgian not an Alabama, because the nurse has the opinion that liberals in Alabama are hell freezes over and he wants to refute that because he wants to convince him that he is a Georgian. Conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">but</span><span class="font4"> in the data functions opposite the first clause to another has been mentioned by Sutasoma (2022:29). In this data conjunction emphasizes the type of conjunction, but for a meaning behind the conversation.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Causal</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">To express causality, use the verbs so, thus, for, therefore, in line with, and consequently. Prepositional phrases with the sense of outcome (of this) as a whole have the same ability to arise as those with the sense of hostility.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">So are the narrative uses straightforward expressions of causal relationships. The preposition so has the purpose of introducing &quot;a result&quot; of what has been spoken before. The illustration is provided below:</span></p>

Are we clear?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tucker &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: crystal?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the data above, in the conversation between the President and his assistant, Tucker, in the Homeland Security room regarding the planned murder of the great killers Robie and Reel, the president asked Tucker by poking his body telling Tucker to form a team that there was no margin for error. The conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">so</span><span class="font4"> on the data above is shown as an example of Causal, the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">so</span><span class="font4"> connects the previous sentence, clause or to another. From the conversation above, with the type of causal conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">so</span><span class="font4"> which emphasizes the function of a conjunction, the president in the first sentence says I respect Robie and Reel. Followed by but again, there is no margin of error here, Evan. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">So, you get the hell out of them and make damn sure they are absolutely ready for this. </span><span class="font4">The conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">so</span><span class="font4"> the function is to explain the result of the fact that there is no margin of error. due to the absence of margin of error, as the result Evan has to go from there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">so</span><span class="font4">, showing the result relationship Sutasoma (2022: 34) in his explanation. emphasizing the conjunction showed the result of the previous clause.

<p><span class="font4">Tucker : Rest assured was a trainer at the Burner </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font4">two years. I do not let up anyone, most of myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the example above, Marks and Tucker are assistants to the President of North Korea, the conversation takes place at night in the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility room in Korea, and talks about keeping an eye on the fugitive assassins Jessica Reel and Will Robie who want to kill the US President. The assassins are in their respective apartments and hotels and will soon go to the Burner box room, a training centre. Conjunction for in the first clause explains that Tucker is a trainer at Burner box, so the conjunction for gives the result that Tucker has been a trainer at Burner box for two years. And the function of the conjunction here emphasizes that he told and convinces Marks Tucker's ability is undoubtedly about Burner box. Sutasoma (2022:34) in his explanation conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font4"> is to give the result of the previous clause. More offer this research emphasizes the type of conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font4"> the functions is to explain the meaning in the conversation.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Temporal</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">The temporal relationship might become more precise with the addition of a second meaning component and the passage of time. In each of these instances, the order of the phrases themselves corresponds to the external chronological relationship. Other expressions of temporal linkage include next, next after, next, after that, later, and since in addition to then and complete then.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">When joining two clauses to form a complex sentence, the word &quot;before&quot; is employed as a conjunction. For the example on the below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Data 7 </span><span class="font4">(David Baldacci 2014: 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Earl &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Can they be? worse is what I mean</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Nurse : Guess anything can be worse. And maybe you should've thought of that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">before </span><span class="font4">you got to this place</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the novel, the conversation above, the field when Earl and the nurse who treated him. The situation here is that Earl asks because there are bar inmates, he asks the nurse if they could be worse than Earl, and the nurse answers him by shrugging her</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">shoulders and anything could be worse. The example above has shown the conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font4"> in the second sentence of the conversation which shows a temporal conjunction. In the conversation, the first sentence said by the nurse is Guess anything can be worse. Followed by the sentence </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">And maybe you should've thought of that before you got to this place</span><span class="font4">, using the conjunction before in the second sentence, where before refers to show the answer to the question from Earl, namely </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Can they be worse is what I mean </span><span class="font4">that the function of the type of temporal conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font4"> by the nurse means the location of any action can be worse than Earl, and before that bad thing happens it is better for Earl to think first before he is imprisoned for his case as a murderer so as not to.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">When used in a sentence. When is a conjunction that is used to signify &quot;at the time that.&quot; When is a subordinate clause (sc) that requires a main clause (mc) to fully express its meaning. The data of temporal conjunction “when” can be seen bellow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Data 8 </span><span class="font4">(David Baldacci 2014: 25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jessica Reel : Take the next right. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">When </span><span class="font4">you reach the alley, punch it</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Robie &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Nice Jessica</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the conversation in the novel above, Robie and his friend Julie are at a restaurant. The situation is when they are about to go home and Robie takes Julie to her house by car, on the way home Jessica Robie's partner calls, and Robie picks up the phone, at that moment Robie looks in the rearview mirror and finds a mysterious car following him with Julie, it was heard by Jessica through their conversation on the phone and Jessica has a plan and gives directions to Robie so that he is not followed again by the mysterious car. The function of conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">when</span><span class="font4"> to give showing the time Sutasoma (2022: 39), when Robie had turned right, and reached the alley, then Jessica told him to hit the alley, and Robie turned the steering wheel of his car and managed to escape from the mythical car, then said </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nice Jessica</span><span class="font4"> on the phone With Jessica's way they can avoid the mysterious followers behind the car, because Jessica wants her friend to safe arrival.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Adversative Relation (Proper)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Adversative relation is the relation that appeared in the clause or sentence that opposed the expectation from the previous sentence to the next sentence Halliday and Hassan (1985). One conjunction though that refers to an adversative relation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">a. Though</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though means 'despite something'. This is a subordinating conjunction. That is, the clause they introduce is a subordinate clause, which needs a main clause to make it complete, which means 'despite'. For the example sentence can be seen on the below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Data 9 </span><span class="font4">(David Baldacci 2014: 119)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The waiter looked at her severely as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">though </span><span class="font4">silently admonishing her for eating this Western garbage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The data shows that Chung-Cha is an embassy from the North Korean government who is carrying out his duties for a development. This situation occurred when Chung-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cha was hungry and went to a restaurant in Korea to buy food, but he was interested in buying food at an American restaurant in Korea. He ordered a burger, potatoes, and a vanilla milk shake, which was not his everyday meal. He was the only Korean eating at the American restaurant, the rest were Westerners. And the waiter gave him a mute glance as if he were perplexed as to why he would want to eat such Western garbage. The data is included in the conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">though</span><span class="font4"> which is part of the Adversative Relation (Proper) previously explained which gives information that is opposite to the previous clause Sutasoma (2020: 45). Where the previous clause shows the waiter looked at her severely, while the though clause that has shown the opposite information is the waiter silently admonishing her for eating this Western garbage. The conjunction function of though emphasizes that the waiter looked at Chung-Cha, a Korean, for eating at an American restaurant, and as if he wanted to admonish her for not eating at a Korean restaurant.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Simple Temporal Relation</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">This function is basically associated with the word then. This function linked the previous clause or sentence to another as the time that has happened in the sentence Halliday and Hassan (1985).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">a. Then</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The word &quot;then&quot; can function as several parts of speech. For comma usage, the most important usage is as a conjunction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Data 10 </span><span class="font4">(David Baldacci 2014: 62)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He tapped his head, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">then </span><span class="font4">dipped to his chest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The description of the novel above shows that when there is a meeting between the President of North Korea and his assistant named Tucker at a headquarters. They talked about the arrest of an assassin and there was an argument between the president and his assistant. Where the assistant after being scolded by the president immediately </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">he tapped his head and, then dipped to his chest</span><span class="font4">. The conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">then</span><span class="font4"> as from the data above connects the first clause with the next clause and provides the same information has explained by Sutasoma (2020: 48). Where the first clause states about he tapped his chest, and the conjunction then connects the first clause by explaining what happens next, namely </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and then dipped to his chest</span><span class="font4">. The function of the conjunction </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">then </span><span class="font4">emphasizes that the assistant to the president wants to tell him that he is a patient person who can be relied on even though he is angry.What does the number mean? What implication it brings to the topic. Add this information in the discussion.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Conjunctions are important in connecting one sentence, word, and clause with another. In the data analysis, it is the additive conjunction type that appears the most. This happens because as seen from its function, an additive is a phrase and word that shows information. Where it can add one statement with another statement. The meaning in the conversation data spoken by the characters in the novel “The Target” has an important role that confirms that the function of conjunctions is not just as a connecting word, but can examine the existence of a hidden meaning that has a specific purpose, and also can be a combination several numbers of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. By analyzing the conjunctions found in the novel, in the future, it is hoped that this</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">research can be relevant, provide knowledge, understand, and study the use of conjunctions more deeply which can be seen according to their function.</span></p>
