<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The development of the tourism industry in Bali is beneficial in increasing income, employment opportunities and exchange rates. But not all the benefits of tourism are enjoyed by the Balinese people, some of these benefits are leak out of Bali's economic system in the form of tourism leakage. The results of the Suryawardani </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font2"> (2016) regarding the calculation of Bali tourism leakage found that the average size of Bali tourism leakage from the sector of tourism was 20% and the highest leakage was in 4-star and 5-star hotel chains (55.3%). The research also found that the source of leakage was the use of imported beverages (64.1%), imported foods (20%) and foreign workers (2.1%). To minimize the leakage, the use of local beverage products is very important as a substitute product. One of the local beverage products that is currently developing is Hatten Wines. Bali as one of the tourist destinations both domestic and foreign, is very dependent on agricultural products, one of which is related to the provision of beverage products, namely wine for tourists. The latest data from the company Hatten Wines shows that since 2008 there has been a decrease in sales volume, one of the causes of which is a change in consumer behavior</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">which has implications in the development of marketing strategies which are related to the marketing mix, namely product, price, promotion, as well as place and distribution. Consumers have diverse perceptions in relation to purchasing decisions and loyalty to a product. Positive consumer perceptions of aspects of the marketing mix, can guarantee satisfaction in using the product so that it will continue to rebuy, and then trigger loyalty. Therefore, research on the role of the marketing mix on the consumers' purchasing decisions and loyalty to Hatten Wines products is very important in order to form a marketing strategy to increase the role of Hatten Wines products in the tourist market, especially foreign tourists.</span></p>
