<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Code switching is a phenomenon which can be found in our daily conversations even both in written or spoken. Code switching refers to the use of two languages within a sentence or discourse. This study entitled Code Switching in Line Group Chatting used by English Students of English Department in Udayana University used qualitative and quantitative method. Three types of code switching proposed by Poplack (1980) and three main factor of code switching proposed by Holmes (2013). In order to analyze the factors of code switching, open-ended and close-ended questionnaire was given to the 18 English students in C class. There were 25 data which divided into tag switching, inter-sentential switching and intra-sentential switching. The type of code switching which mostly used by the English students is intra-sentential switching. According to the questionnaire, social factor such as participant, status, and solidarity have an important roles in influencing the code switching.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Alih bahasa merupakan sebuah fenomena yang mudah dijumpai baik dalam tulisan maupun lisan. Alih bahasa mengacu pada penggunaan dua bahasa dalam kalimat atau wacana. Penelitian ini berjudul Code Switching in Line Group Chatting used by English Students of English Department in Udayana Unviersity dan penelitian ini menggunakan metode kuantitatif dan kualitatif. Penelitian ini menggunakan teori dari Poplack (1980) yaitu tiga tipe dari alih bahasa dan teori dari Holmes (2013) yaitu tiga faktor utama dari alih bahasa. Untuk menganalisa permasalahan kedua yaitu tentang faktor dari alih bahasa, kuesisoner terbuka dan kuesioner tertutup diberikan kepada 18 mahasiswa sastra Inggris di kelas C. Di dalam penelitian ini, terdapat 25 data yang dibagi menjadi tag switching, inter-sentential switching, dan intra-sentential switching dan tipe alih bahasa yang paling sering digunakan adalah intra-sentential switching. Berdasarkan hasil dari kuesioner, faktor sosial seperti peserta, status, dan solidaritas memiliki peran peting yang dapat mempengaruhi seseorang dalam melakukan alih bahasa.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Code switching is a common phenomenon in today’s society, especially in bilingual or multilingual environment. Code switching certainly can be found in conversations, lectures, speeches, or other kinds of communication, delivered both in written and spoken forms. This fact showed that how important code switching takes role in communication events. Code switching as a field of study has a rich and varied literature encompassing research based on various theoretical models and research methodologies. The dominant perspectives in the study of code switching have been either sociolinguistic or grammatical in nature. Code switching occurs when a speaker alternates between two or more languages in speaking or writing. Since there were a lot of people who can speak more than two languages, they often switch their languages. We could see this phenomenon in English students’ conversations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the most useful social media which used by people to communicate is called Line: Free Calls and Messages. Social media Line is not only for chatting, we could share photos, videos, or even audios. Phone call or video call is also available in the social media Line. Besides, people can also make a group chat if they want to send a message to many people in one time. English students in Udayana University especially in the 8<sup>th</sup> semester consist of 80 students which divided into four classes and each class has its own group chat. They sometimes switch from one language into another language when they were chatting in the group, not only from Indonesian into English, but sometimes they switch it from Indonesian into Balinese, Korean, French, or</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chinese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">phenomenon, it is really interesting to analyze the types of code switching and why the students use code switching when they were chatting in the Line group.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and technique of analyzing data</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">In analyzing the data, qualitative and quantitative method was used. The technique used to analyze the types of code switching is descriptive. First, the data were analyzed in order to know the types of code switching by using Poplack (1980)’s theory, then the data were classified into tag switching, inter-sentential switching or intra-sentential switching in a descriptive way. In order to answer the second problem that is about factors of code switching, the theory proposed by Holmes (2013) with open-ended and close-ended questionnaire is used. Because the data presented in a diagram, quantitative method was used.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This chapter presented the analysis of the code switching in English students chats in Line groups. The analysis focused on three points, they are: three types of code switching such as tag switching, intra-sentential switching and inter-sentential switching, and three factors of code switching proposed by Holmes (2013) they are: participant, solidarity, and status.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Tag switching could involve a tag, an exclamation, or a parenthesis. The data is:</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/43115-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:173pt;height:80pt;">
<p><span class="font6">GungMas: “You know, I have to take care of my puppies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The code switching above was said by Gung Mas in Jelly.

The data above categorized as tag switching because it occurs in the beginning of the sentence and it is separated by a comma. She switched from English into Indonesia, the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">you know </span><span class="font6">is in English then she added Indonesian suffix -</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">lah</span><span class="font6"> and then continued by Indonesian. The switch word you </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">knowlah </span><span class="font6">means that the writer (GungMas) believes that the readers know the reason why she cannot hang out with them before she explained it to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The code switching above was said by Gung Mitha in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cliponyu</span><span class="font6"> group. She said, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hati hati ya men temen mau akhir tahun</span><span class="font6">. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Stay safe</span><span class="font6">. The word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">stay safe </span><span class="font6">means that the speaker wanted the reader to be careful because of the new year-eve. This data can be categorized as inter-sentential switching because it switched between a clause or a sentence boundary, where each clause or sentence was in one language and then in the next sentence, the speaker used another language, it might occur between the speaker turns.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Figure 3. Frequency of Male Using Code Switching</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The respondent for this study are 12 English students in Udayana University which consist of 6 females and 6 males. Audrey Nelson (2009) said that women usually do the code switching to show that she is educated women. On the other hand, code switching also used by women to communicate with male colleagues. Nelson also said that women know how their own communication style and when to use it to get across the message and achieve their goals. Nelson’s statement is related to this study because 50% of the respondents are female and in the data, the one who mostly uses code switching is woman. According to the questionnaire, we could see that female has larger tendency in the frequency of using code switching in her daily conversations. When women feel comfortable with the other participant, they usually use code switching more than males do to make the conversations interesting or to look intellectual in front of the other participant. In the questionnaire, there were 3 (50%) women who always do the code switching, 2 (33%) said that they rarely do the code switching and 1 (17%) said that they often do the code switching.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Figure 4. Place of Birth</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the figure 4 and 5, we could see that 10 out of the 12 respondents were born in Bali and the rest were born in Java. Since the respondents were born in different places, they could speak at least 2 languages or more (figure 5) and it is influencing the language choice of the participants which lead them to do the code switching. Based on the questionnaire, 83% of the respondents were born in Bali and 17% of the respondents were born in Java and it turned out that the respondents who were born in Java have ability in speaking more than three languages but most of them are local languages. Not only those who were born in Java which have abilities in speaking or understanding many languages, there were two students who were born in Bali which could speak another foreign language that are French, Malay, and Hokkien.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Relationship between The Number of Language and the Factors of Code Switching</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Based on the questionnaire, the respondents did the code switching because of the solidarity within the same ethnicity or within the same group. In this case, the respondents did the code switching because they belong to the same group that is English students. The students who were born in Java, sometimes switch from Indonesian into Javanese when they were talking to the other participants within the same ethnicity. Related to the factor of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">solidarity, status and participant also has an important role in doing the code switching. Participant is the one who involved in the conversations and it cannot be separated with topic and social context while status means the relationship between the speakers and it related to the formal and informal status of the speakers.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Relationship between Sex and Factor of Code Switching</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">From all those data, 22 data which contain code switching were presented by woman and the rest 3 data presented by men. Sex could influence someone in switching from one language into another language, just like Nelson (2009) said, woman use code switching to attract people’s attention or to achieve their goals, that’s why women use code switching more than the man did.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Frequency and Factor of Code Switching</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been shown in the figure 1 that in total (female and male respondents), 42% of the respondents said that they always do the code switching, 50% of the respondents said that they rarely do the code switching, and 8% of the respondents said that they rarely do the code switching. There are a lot of factors which influencing someone switching from one language into another language and according to the result of the questionnaire, the respondents who always switch from one language into another language in their conversations (more than 10 times) per day said that they did the code switching because there are no words available in the target language or it is hard for them to catch the right words. Not only that, they also said that participant and status are important factors that contributing someone in switching the languages.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">There were 25 data and divided into tag switching, inter-sentential switching and intra-sentential switching. There were 4 data which are in tag switching, 6 data which are in inter-sentential switching, and 15 data which are in intra-sentential switching. According to the questionnaire given to the 12 English students in C class of Udayana University, social factors such as participant, status and solidarity have an important roles in switching the word (Holmes 2013). Beside those main factors, there were other factors such as topic, social context and formal-informal status which contributing in the factor of code switching. The respondents said that they use code switching because there is lack of knowledge or register in the target language. They also use code switching depend on the topic, participant or the context of situation.</span></p>
