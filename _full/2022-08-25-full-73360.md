ThetaStar is an efficient algorithm that can be used to find an optimal path in a map with better performance compared to the AStar algorithm Combining the ThetaStar with Hierarchical Pathfinding further enhances its performance by abstracting a large map into several clusters What this combination lacks is the capability to handle a dynamic element in the map Without that capability the agent could potentially collide with elements in the map that is undesi
