<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The paper analyses syntax analysis in relative clause found in the novel “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”. “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” is a literary work of kid story by Lyman Frank Baum and the illustration was made by W.W. Denslow. Dorothy lived with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry and her dog, Toto. Theory of relative clauses that was proposed by Quirk (1985), Sneddon (1996) and was supported by other theories. The theory used to analyze the syntax structure was the theory proposed by Brown and Miller. The method that was used to get the data was qualitative, library research. The data were taken from the novel entitled “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”. This research study aims to: (i) analyze the syntax structure in the relative clause found in the novel entitled “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”, (ii) analyze the types of relative clauses in the relative clauses found in the novel entitled “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">A literary work is in non-dramatic textual works with or without illustration. Computer programs and databases can also be considered as literary works. One of literary work is the novel entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.</span><span class="font2"> It is a kid story telling about Dorothy and her Aunt Em. In the novel entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</span><span class="font2"> the researcher found that there are many data in relative clauses. The data of relative clauses are interested to be analyzed using the tree diagram in order to know about the syntax analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An idea, a question, and statements are expressed by words and as we know that there is a subject and verb in the sentence. Phrases and sentences are usually built up of constituent series and it can serve as as grammatical function. This can be seen that the arrangement and the form of word are related in a sentence. Some words that can build some sentences in English are as one unit. In a sentence, there are subject, verb, complement, object and adverbial (SVCOA).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A clause is in independent and dependent clause. Independent clause can be a clause standing alone as a simple sentence. Meanwhile, a dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence although there is a subject and a verb in it. The types of dependent clauses are categorized into adverbial clauses, noun clauses and adjective clauses. Noun clause is in a subordinate clause used as a noun in the sentence. There are three main structural types of clauses which are analyzed. Finite clause, nonfinite clause and verbless clause are parts of it which are analyzed. The verb element in finite is called as finite clause. Nonfinite clause can be a clause in which verb element is in non-finite. For example, it can be seen in to-infinitive, bare infinitive, -</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">27 </span><span class="font2">ing participle, and –ed participle. Verbless clause can be a clause in which there is no verb element, but it is nevertheless capable of being analysed into clause of elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The dependent clauses can fill grammatical functions in a sentence. Based on their functions, there are some types of dependent clauses that can be classified into some types. For example, noun clause, adverb clause, adjective clause. A dependent clause that can function as a noun in the sentence is stated as noun clause. Relative clause is as a subordinate clause that is also used in order to modify a noun or pronoun found in the main clause. Relative clause is also used in the level of phrase. This can be found in a relative pronoun, especially in that, who, which or whose. In English, relative clause is also classified into two categories. Those are restrictive/defining and non-restrictive/non-defining. In relative clause, relative pronoun occurs in clause initially. In restrictive relative clause, the sentence gives the hearer in sufficient information. But in non-restrictive relative clause, an additional information is provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the phenomena above, the researcher has the purposes in analyzing the text. The first is to analyze about the types of relative clauses found in the novel entitled “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”.</span><span class="font2"> The second is to analyze about the syntax structure in relative clauses found in the novel. The syntax structure is analyze by using the tree diagram and using the theory proposed by Brown and Miller. In analyzing the types of relative clause, the researcher uses the theory proposed by Quirk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The theory used to analyze the types of relative clause is theory proposed by Comrie. Those are restrictive/defining and non-restrictive/non-defining. In relative clause, relative pronoun can be found initially. The theories are chosen because the theories can analyze the types of relative clauses found in the data source. This research uses qualitative method as the results of data analysis are described descriptively. The theories used to analyze syntax analysis in the tree diagram is the theory proposed by Brown and Miller. The tree diagrams are analyzed in order to know about the syntax structure found in the relative clauses. Relative clauses is usually placed after a noun phrase. It can givessome information related to the person or thing indicated by noun phrase. The connection that is located between the noun phrase in the main clause is in the main clause. It is known as the antecedent and the relative pronoun in the relative clause. Restrictive relative clauses are connected to the head and it denotes a limitation on the reference of the antecedent. Here is the example of it:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a.</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that will disturb me anyway.</span><span class="font2"> Quirk (1985)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Nonrestrictive clauses provides additional information and do not further define, the antecedent. Relative pronouns introduce relative clause, here is the example:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a.</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothes which I ordered last week have arrived</span><span class="font2"> Quirk (1985)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The relative pronoun </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">which</span><span class="font2"> in the example above introduces the relative clause </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">which I ordered last week.</span><span class="font2"> The relative pronoun is different from personal pronoun. The sentence that contains relative pronoun is placed at the beginning of the clause. It can be subject, complement, adverbial, postmodifier, prepositional complement, or object (Quirk et al, 1985: 365).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In general, relative pronouns can be categorized into two categories:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a.</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wh-</span><span class="font2"> pronoun: who, whom, whose, which</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">b.</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that</span><span class="font2"> and Zero (o) clause provides information needed to make the antecedent definite.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The head of a relative clause functions in two different clauses in the relative clause construction. The term head is restricted to the noun phrase in question because it occurs in the main clause. However, it plays role in the restricting clause, for example relative clause in the sense of the embedded (subordinate) clause Comrie (1981). The head noun can be seen in the embedded sentence in the normal position or with the normal case marking for a noun phrase. In pronoun-retention type, the head noun remains in the embedded sentence in pronominal form. The head noun appears in a modified or reduced form, in one of the two clauses. In non-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">reduction, the head appears in full in the embedded sentence, in the normal position. In the pronoun-retention type, the head noun is in the embedded sentence in pronominal form.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Library research is the strategy that is used in collecting data. The technique of collecting data were done by doing note taking, reading and observing. The process of collecting data were done by reading the entire novel in order to understand the story of the novel and to observe the possibility of the data that could be taken from the novel entitled “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”</span><span class="font2">. Firstly, the entire novel were read in order to get complex sentence containing relative clauses. After it, it is continued to select the data that is based on the problems discussed in this research study. Finally, the types of relative clauses were classified and continued to analyze the syntax structure in the tree diagram. Library research was the strategy that was used in collecting the data.

<p><span class="font2">The types of relative clauses found in the data source is restrictive relative clause with relative pronoun </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">who.</span><span class="font2"> For example, it can be seen from the relative clause </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">who had taken her message to the Wizard</span><span class="font2"> that has the constituent structure of subject (who), verb phrase (had taken), noun phrase (her message) and prepositional phrase (to the wizard). The data source is analyzed using the tree diagram. It has the purpose to analyze the syntax analysis by using the tree diagram. In analyzing the types of relative clause, the researcher uses the theory proposed by Comrie (1981). He stated that as with the pronoun-retention type, there is a pronoun in the relative clause indicating the head. The head of a relative clause functions in two different clauses in the relative clause construction. The term head is restricted to the noun phrase in question because it occurs in the main clause.</span></p>
