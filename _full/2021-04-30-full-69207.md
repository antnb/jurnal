Image interpolation is the most basic requirement for many image processing tasks such as medical image processing Image interpolation is a technique used in resizing an image To change the image size each pixel in the new image must be remapped to a location in the old image to calculate the new pixel value There are many algorithms available for determining the new pixel value most of which involve some form of interpolation between the closest pixels in the
