<p><span class="font4">Place is a space that is given meaning by its users [1][2]. Place is defined as a space that has cultural significance and social processes. Space changes into a place, when there are social ties, feelings and emotions of users [2][3].</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Various disciplines have tried to study the relationships formed between humans and places, including: human geography, human behavior and the environment, sociology, and environmental psychology [1][4]. One common response about a person's inner attachment to a place is visiting favorite places, which can create a response to a person about feelings of comfort, intimacy, and pleasure to that place. Ideal and preferred places associated with favorite places [5][6].</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Denpasar City is a city on the island of Bali and at the same time the capital of Bali Province, Indonesia, according to BPS data Denpasar has a population growth rate of approximately 4% a year, and is a city that has a very heterogeneous population so that there are many communities formed one of them is in the form of &quot;villages&quot;, such as the one in the Pekraman Pemogan Village area which is named Banjar Dinas Kampung Islam Kepaon Pemogan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the residents of the Kepaon Pemogan Islamic Village Denpasar, are descendants of soldiers from Raden Mas Cokro Panolo Bangsawan Bugis who married the daughter of the King of Pemecutan Kingdom named Anak Agung Mas Dewi. After marrying as a Mualaf with the name &quot;Siti Kadijah&quot;, Siti Kadijah was then killed by local residents, as many as forty (40) remaining soldiers of Raden</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mas Cokro Panolo moved to the Kepaon area and settled in the area [7]. This is where the beginning of the formation of a village located in the Kepaon Traditional Village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Kampung Islam Kepaon, Pemogan, Denpasar is an area that has its own uniqueness, namely residents who have lived in this area for a long time, it is very difficult to move out of the Kepaon Pemogan Islamic Village area, this is due to the sense of inner attachment of the community to the environment in which they live, wrong One factor of people's inner attachment to their environment is that there are many favorite places. Favorite places are formed due to a process of feeling happy, comfortable, and familiar with someone in a place, so that people often visit these places. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the factors of feeling happy, comfortable, and familiar with someone visiting a favorite place is the presence of good quality facilities such as physical object facilities, non-physical object facilities and infrastructure facilities found in these favorite places. This is an interesting phenomenon to study regarding the places that are considered favorite and the quality of the facilities for favorite places in the Kepaon Islamic Village Area, Pemogan, Denpasar.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">II.</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ethod</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The qualitative research method [8] was chosen in this study because it is very difficult to know someone's feelings about a place, so direct observation in the field is needed to determine the natural environment (natural setting). And the approach chosen is a case study approach [9], this is because this research examines the behavior of a group or community in the Kepaon Islamic Village, Pemogan, Denpasar and the research area has a narrow (micro) area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are several guidelines using case studies in this research, namely: (1) Planning to answer the problem formulation on the problems of places that are considered favorite and the feeling of comfort, pleasure and familiarity of the people in the research area regarding these favorite places; (2) Finding data sources by contacting influential people in the research area; (3) data processing by coding every interview or writing; (4) negotiating the results of the study with theory, (5) formulating conclusions on the results of the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To obtain data, a technique was carried out by inviting residents of Kepaon Islamic Village, Pemogan, Denpasar to find out people's favorite places in the neighborhood where they live according to as well as places they are frequently visited. After that, make observations on the quality of the facilities for the favorite places of the community, the facilities in question are physical object facilities, nonphysical object facilities, and finally infrastructure facilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Data mining is carried out in two stages, the first stage is the preparation stage, through performance base selection [10], this is useful for overcoming barriers to language, age, and educational background, length of stay of residents in the area, and Finally, the selected sources are those who live</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in each location in the research area of the Kepaon Pemogan Islamic Village, Denpasar (not grouped in one neighborhood).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This stage involved the chairman of the Al-Muhajirin Foundation organization, Kepaon Pemogan Islamic Village, Mr. Haji Ishak, along with the management staff of the foundation's organization and the sub-department of the Office of Mr. Muhamad Asmara, to invite the public to attend the interview, potential resource persons themselves were determined as follows: (1 ) Age between 18 and 60 years, (2) Have a Resident Identity Card and have been living in this area for a long time, (3) The lowest education is high school or equivalent, (4) and does not live in one neighborhood (one place)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Kepaon Islamic Village, Pemogan, Denpasar consists of 5 total tempek. Tempek one is residents who live in the area of Gang Muhajirin one to Gang Muhajirin lima, tempek two residents who live around the Gang Soleh area, and tempek three residents who live around the Jalan Taman Pancing area, then proceed with tempek four residents who live around the area The graves of &quot;Abah&quot; to Gang Soka, and lastly, five residents who live far outside the Kepaon Pemogan Islamic Village area but are still domiciled in this area to be more clearly defined in Figure 1 below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of people invited to be interviewees in one tempek with another tempek has different numbers of sources, this is determined by Mr Kelian Dinas and Mr Chairman of the Al-Muhajirin Foundation. The reason is because each tempek has a different number of residents, the first tempek consists of five sources, the second tempek has four sources, the third tempek has four sources, the fourth tempek has three sources, and finally the fifth tempek has two sources, so a total of seventeen speakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the next stage used is the interview method by writing (Morissan, 2012), by asking participants to write down their favorite places and feelings that exist in these favorite places. While the place to hold the meeting is located in the area of Madrasah Aaliyah Yayasan Al-Muhajirin, the Islamic Village of Kepaon Pemogan Denpasar, when the implementation was held on Sunday, May 3 2019.</span></p>
