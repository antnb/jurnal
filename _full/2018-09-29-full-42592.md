<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Background</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">One of the tourism education programs is the study tour which becomes the annual routine agenda of a number of educational institutions. The study tour program is designed to provide a learning experience for students, through visits to several places, including; historical sites, colleges, and cultural heritage. The visit aims to provide object recognition to learners and provide a direct description of historical events that occurred in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The learning experience gained from study tours contributes to the success of learning in educational institutions. Classroom theory's learning provides a basic understanding of a science, while field study deepens the understanding of that science. Learning experience itself can be realized optimally through the involvement of teachers in educational institutions and educators as mentors for field study. The study tour program enables learners to be actively involved and interact with the wider community. The process is able to change the character of passive learners into the initiative, critical thinking and problem-solving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Vredeburg Fort Museum is a special history museum of national struggle located in Malioboro tourism area, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The market segment at the Vredeburg Fort Museum is evenly distributed between men and women. Visitors are predominantly under 30 years old, ie high school and junior high school students from outside Yogyakarta and visit frequency 1 to 2 times (Field survey, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The number of tourists visiting Vredeburg Fort Museum from year to year has increased more than 20%. From 2012 to 2015 the number of tourists is 1,251,519 people, on average per year of 312,879 people. The highest number of tourists in June and December is 20 to 40 thousand people per month. The Graph of visitor numbers at Vredeburg Fort Museum can be seen in Figure 1.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/42592-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:216pt;height:174pt;">

<p><span class="font3">Some tourists do not experience learning process in the study tour program but only have limited information. This problem occurs because of several factors, including; lack of teacher counseling and very limited visit times. The content of educational tourism has not been able to meet educational objectives and targets, as tour operators have not yet familiarized themselves with the educational curriculum, do not understand the needs of learners, and do not make additional preparations. The educational tourism market has a demand for long life learning that is professionally managed by involving</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">pedagogical elements. Meanwhile, not many tourism providers are able to design educational attractions with the involvement of pedagogical elements and managed by competent human resources. In this case, the academics are required to work with stakeholders to design a study tour that is able to facilitate learners to gain knowledge (Prakapienė and Olberkytė, 2013). Vredeburg Fort Museum is one of the tourist destinations that offer educational tourism with cooperative concepts and able to realize the history learning experience for learners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nowadays, some museums experience a shift in attributes to increase the number of visitors. The shift is in the form of expanding the museum collection, which has the potential to change the function and role of the museum itself. From a manager's perspective, the museum not only functions as a tourist attraction but also as a source of historical information and media for cultural preservation (Bagus et al., 2015).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Objective of the study was to evaluate the role of </span><span class="font4">Vredeburg Fort Museum as an educational tourism</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>LITERATURE REVIEW</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Educational tourism or edu-tourism is a travel program to a destination with the ultimate goal of gaining a learning experience that is directly related to the destination (Bodger, 1998). (Bodger, 1998) defines education tourism as a potential segment movement program to a particular location to acquire new knowledge related to their discipline. (William, 2010) states educational tourism is a tourism activity undertaken by people who travel through a journey for education and learning, either as a primary or secondary purpose. Hecht et al., (2007) convey education tourism is a special interest tourism, where the market segment has a desire to learn. For learners, education tourism is a means of understanding a tourism destination, whereas teachers define educational tourism as a means to transmit abstract knowledge and professionalism support facilities (Pitman, et al., 2010). Educational tourism enables</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">learners to understand global interconnects, enhance their learning experience in the field, out of comfort zones, and learn about critical thinking of real life, and global implications. Educational tourism is an experiential learning method that enriches the educational process by engaging learners through contributions to local communities to obtain mutually beneficial results. Learners implement academic skills to solve problems in the field and connect learning objectives with the field needs. Educational tourism is organized and involves the pedagogic process through the tour, where the learning experience as a core component with a lifelong learning agenda (Pitman, Broomhall and Mcewan, 2010). The lifelong learning process through diverse forums became a means of personal and social development (Strain, 1998). Educational tourism has tremendous potential to offer meaningful and lifelong learning experiences for travelers and practitioners (Watson, 2003). Educational tourism is implemented through educational programs to change the knowledge, skills, and cognitive behavior of learners (Bhuiyan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font3">, 2010) and (Fidgeon, 2010) emphasize that educational tourism creates favorable conditions of learning for all ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Academics and tourism service providers understand the pedagogical function of educational tourism in different ways. Academics define learning components as non-recreational activities, formal and structured to gain knowledge. Meanwhile, tourism service providers understand it as a fun travel activity (Pitman, Broomhall and Mcewan, 2010). The success of the learning process in educational tourism is strongly influenced by the role of educators and tourism service providers. Educators conceptualize educational tourism in scientific qualifications with the primary goal of a learning experience for learners. Tourism providers enhance the learning experience by providing materials by educators (Pitman, Broomhall and Mcewan, 2010). Meanwhile, the website plays a role in assisting the management of educational tourism, as a provider of information. The website provides the information needed before, during and after the tour of educational tourism. Learners use the website to complete the data in the process of preparing the study tour report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tourists of educational tourism are those who travel far from the city or country of origin, and at least an overnight stay, whose education and learning are secondary objectives, but are considered an important way to pass the free time (Ritchie, 2003). Tourists take part in tour studies to improve or learn new skills. According to the (WTO, 2012), educational tourists are individuals or groups who travel to and live outside their environment for more than 24 hours, but no more than one year for study, business, recreation and other activities. Ritchie (2003) divides the educational tourism market segment into three groups, namely elderly, college students, and school students. Meanwhile, (Ankomah and Larson, 2000) divide the educational tourism market share based on the potential exchange of students, namely domestic, intra-regional, Europe, and North America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The motivation for traveling is increasingly understood as a long-term psychological need and an individual life plan (Cohen, 1984). Towner (1996) suggests that education and learning tourism can take place both formally and informally depending on the individual's motivation and the type of experience requested. Today travel motivation is not only related to social and psychological needs but to the stage of one's life. The desire to travel and search for new knowledge and information continues to grow, so that exploration of the offer raises various types of educational tourism, including; journey to science (landscape, ornithology, ecology, and geology), cultural and heritage tours (archeology, ethnicity, patriotic military, religious cognitive and pilgrimage), study tour, sport tourism, and training program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Characteristics of educational tourism as an innovative form of the educational institution should be based on goals, principles, and approaches of contemporary an education. Educational tourism interests are developed from childhood, through curriculum designs involving educational tourism (McGuire et al., 1987). Educational tourism programs are organized in a coordinated and structured manner by involving learners from childhood to create educational market segments and sustainable educational tourism. The educational tourism refers to a non-formal</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">education by performing a fun method of tourism learning activities. Such method of the learning process can be more quickly understood and remembered by the students (Wijayanti et al., 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Educational tourism uses the concept of cooperative learning that is reciprocal for the lives of learners and the community. Cooperative education is a partnership between learners, educational institutions, and tourism service providers. Cooperative education becomes a bridge between educational institutions and industry, allowing learners to get practical training. According to (Ritchie, 2003) various stakeholders work together to meet the demand of tourists in the form of attractions and events that offer learning experiences, through resource specialists who are responsible for delivering learning components, and affinity travel planners from organizations that help plan and develop learning programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Significantly, the learning experience in educational tourism is able to go beyond actual tourist experience, ie interest in a particular topic and includes organized learning elements (Kalinowski and Weiler, 1992). Conservation programs as one of the tourism education programs can be used as an effective means to develop knowledge, skills, and attitudes by realizing a broad-based experience (Hiromi, 2009). Conservation programs are able to provide learning and research experiences for learners while building meaningful relationships with local communities through participation in resource and environmental management. The program provides learning opportunities from the past for future improvement efforts. Conservation programs are used to gain historical and cultural learning experiences. Conservation programs are organized formally and informally, including; field trips, camp programs, experiential and research activities, live lab study, and tours. Pine &amp;&nbsp;Gilmore (1999) offer four types of experience, including educational, entertainment, aesthetic, escapist and referred to as &quot;4E&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The process of educational tourism involves several elements, namely educational institutions, tourism service providers, and the government. Educational institutions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">determine the theme, content of activities, and academic environment. Tourism providers provide tourist attractions, lodging, and transportation. Meanwhile, the government provides facilities and infrastructure to facilitate the smoothness of educational tourism. Cooperation among various stakeholders is divided into two programs, namely classroom and practical experience. In the classroom program, learners gain a basic knowledge and a perceptual view of practical experience programs. In practical experience programs, learners travel to tourism destinations to actively participate and acquire skills to strengthen the knowledge gained in the previous class (Ankomah and Larson, 2000).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The learning process in education tourism consists of three forms, namely; deliberate learning, experiential learning, and structured learning (Ankomah and Larson, 2000). According to (Ritchie, 2003) educational tourism has two forms, namely learning and traveling. The learning, representing dedicated tourists by taking part in the education and training process. While the traveling, representing tourists who are interested in interpretive programs. Ritchie et al., (2008) distinguishes two major groups of educational tourism. The first group is a visit directly related to the education process, general subjects and a particular curriculum capable of extending formal education. The second group, the educational journey that performs the educational function but is not related to a particular subject and arranged in the non-formal education process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Educational tourism illustrates the activity on the journey across international borders to acquire intellectual services, in search of new experiences and cultures (Abubakar et al., 2014). It encourages local governments to market educational institutions for intellectual development by attracting foreign students to travel and experience a new culture. In addition, countries offering educational tourism are becoming very rich and competitive in the tourism sector (Rico &amp;&nbsp;Loredana, 2009). The management of educational tourism requires competent personnel, including; knowledge, skills, abilities, and communication techniques (Procter, 2012; Wong &amp;&nbsp;Wong, 2009).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Educational tourism is developed based on fundamental educational principles so that it becomes a very effective teaching technology (Zholobova, 2006; Belyaeva, 2007; Bhuiyana et al., 2010). Educational tourism organizes tourism as an educational activity to achieve its goals and meet the targets set by the curriculum. It focuses on the formation and development of individual qualities expressed as general and special professional competencies (Chen &amp;&nbsp;Naquin, 2008; Hoffmann, 1999; McLegan, 1997). William (2010) presents a pedagogical and didactic basis for the development of the concept of educational tourism lies in the pedagogy sectoral (tourism), because its functional represent the educational process carried out outside the educational institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The elements to be considered when designing a study tour, namely the student base, including physiological, psychophysical, emotional, social expression, the need for change, self-actualization needs, intellectual development, exploration and development of creative potential (Abubakar et al., 2014). The implementation of educational tourism involves several elements, namely; the team of planners, development of educational materials, exhibitions and visiting activities, local community involvement, tour operators, media, curriculum, teachers, and local and international organizations (Bhuiyan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font3">, 2010). Implementation of educational tourism requires adaptation to the socio-cultural, environmental, and economic structures of the local community, as it is a process of increasing socio-economic capital, and empowering the community itself (Pitman, Broomhall and Mcewan, 2010).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The number of respondent was 200 visitors who were visiting Vredeburg Fort Museum Yogyakarta who are at least 12 years old. The sample size is determined by consideration of five respondents for each variable manifest (Sugiyono, 2012).</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Data collection and data analysis</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Data collection was undertaken by survey method. The research instrument used 26 points of a statement and measured using a four-point Likert scale, to measure the attitude, opinions, and perceptions of tourists on four variables, namely tourist demand, tourism offerings, tourist attractions, and learning experiences (Djaali, 2008; Riduwan, 2009). The instrument test is performed using validity and reliability test. Validity test was performed by comparing Correlated-Item Total Correlation value with r-table value (Malhotra &amp;&nbsp;Birks, 2007) and reliable test using alpha Cronbach coefficient (Umar, 2003; Urbina, 2004; Sekaran, 2006). Data were analyzed using three box method (Ferdinand, 2006) to find out the variable perception index used to analyze the learning process of history science at the Vredeburg Fort Museum. The three-box criteria analysis has three categories, namely 50.00-100 (low), 100.01-150 (medium), and 150.01-200 (high).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The results show the main purpose of visiting the Vredeburg Fort Museum is enjoying a tourist attraction that offers the experience of learning history, seen from the index value of 174.5. Tourist demand becomes the consideration of Vredeburg Fort Museum managers to design edu-tourism packages relevant to the tourist’s needs. The gap between the tourism demand with the tourism availability give impacted to the less of tourism experience Wijayanti et al., (2017). Vredeburg Fort Museum cooperates with stakeholders to meet tourist demand of attractions and events that offer a history learning experience (Ritchie, 2003). In addition, the role of academics is needed to design a study tour that is able to facilitate learners to gain knowledge of history (Prakapienė and Olberkytė, 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From Table 1, the availability of the product has been satisfied, as seen from the average perception index of respondents to the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">availability of the product of 147.25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The tourist satisfaction is realized as a result of service quality provided by manager of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Vredeburg Fort Museum. Service quality is a very important factor for service industry companies, such as museums (Amelia and Palupi, 2016).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Visitors assess the availability of parking lots and toilets very adequate and comfortable, with an index value above 150. Vredeburg Fort Museum provides adequate parking space in front of the west entrance, both for motor vehicles and cars. Toilets provided for the visitors amounted to 11 pieces, ie 2 in the south of the entrance, 1 in the between diorama two and three, and 8 in the south of the F building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Overall visitors assess the tourist activities in the Museum Vredeburg Fort is very varied, with a high index value, which is 150.71, while the history learning experience of 145.5. Vredeburg Fort Museum implements cooperative learning concept by establishing partnerships with various stakeholders. This concept establishes a bridge between educational institutions, Vredeburg Fort Museum, and industry, also allows learners to get practical training. Cooperative learning at Vredeburg Fort Museum is able to realize effective learning which is organized by considering several elements, as follows (Bhuiyan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font3">, 2010);</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planner team</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The planner team consists of academicians and managers of Vredeburg Fort Museum. In conducting the study tour, the academics and manager of Vredeburg Fort Museum cooperate with other stakeholders to achieve short-term and long-term targets. Study tours are conducted in a structured, not just an annual routine agenda.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educational material development</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The material presented in accordance with the needs of the students, ie learning history. The academics prepare the theme and content of the activities (Ankomah and Larson, 2000). The academics presented the basic material knowledge of historical science to be studied at the Vredeburg Fort Museum, while the Vredeburg Fort Museum manager presents the material in a different form</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">and delivered by the educator (Pitman, Broomhall and Mcewan, 2010).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Event</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The event becomes one of an alternative way of presenting tourism product at Vredeburg Fort Museum. Some events held at the Vredeburg Fort museum, among others; temporary exhibitions, Vredeburg fair, Historical explorations, and theatrical drama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Local community involvement</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Local communities are one of the key elements who guarantee a tourist destination sustainability (Luh, et al., 2014). Vredeburg Museum management involves local communities to realize sustainable tourism and encourage local economic growth. The involvement of learners with local communities is also the goal of the study tour program to build a sustainable travel base in the future (Black, 2000), understanding the global interconnection, as well as developing critical thinking skills and problem-solving for learners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tour operator</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tour operators as service providers are able to design tour packages for academics and Vredeburg Fort Museum so that the study tour program is well organized (Kennes, 1997). The study tour program generally has limited time with a fairly solid agenda of visits (Schejbal, 2013). In this case, the academics need a tour operator role to design an effective and efficient tour package.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Mass Media</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mass media has an important role in the development of study tour programs, including promotion and fulfillment of tourist information needs. The information available on the website is widely used by students to prepare study tour reports (Pitman, Broomhall and Mcewan, 2010). Mass media is needed to meet the information needs of pre, during, and post-study tour at the Vredeburg Fort museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Curriculum</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The curriculum plays a role in planning study tour program for learners to gain experience in learning history. The curriculum itself is able to increase the interest of educational tourism for</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">learners since childhood (McGuire et al., 1987). To provide study tour content in accordance with the needs of learners, Vredeburg Fort Museum manager must familiarize themselves with the curriculum of learners to meet the goals and objectives of education</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The teacher presents the material in the program in the classroom (Ankomah and Larson, 2000). Teachers play a role in helping learners to cultivate an awareness of the learning of history in Vredeburg Fort Museum through classroom teaching.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educator</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The educators provided materials in the program in the practical experience room (Ankomah and Larson, 2000) through the enhancement of the history learning experience at the Vredeburg Fort museum (Pitman, Broomhall and Mcewan, 2010). Edukator accompanies learners in understanding the historical messages conveyed by the manager through collectibles</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tour Flow</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The tour flow influences the understanding of historical stories in the Vredeburg Fort Museum. The Vredeburg Fort Museum offers historical stories since the Diponegoro war (1825) until the New Order (1974) presented in four dioramas. The tour flow greatly influences the understanding of existing historical sciences (Berry at al., 2002). The incorrect tour flow causes learners unable to understand the historical message conveyed by the Vredeburg Fort Museum manager and not gain the experience of historical learning.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local and Internasional Organization Local and international organizations play a major role in implementing study tours through various events. The Vredeburg Fort Museum cooperate with organizations organize various events, such as historical reviews, lectures, historical discussions, workshops, exhibitions, fashion festivals, Javanese song contests, theater, painting contests, coloring competitions, and cultural camps.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">From the result of data analysis, it can be concluded that the concept of cooperative learning in study tour program involves three main elements, namely planner team, event, and local community involvement. Team planner designs various events involving pedagogical elements to encourage learners to engage with local communities in the learning process. Team planner consists of organizations, educators, tour operators, and teachers who work together in designing study tour program. Various events as a tourist attraction designed by considering four important elements, namely; curriculum, mass media, tourism content, and tour flow. Involvement with local communities aims to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">create global interconnection, cultivate critical thinking and problem solving, and realize sustainable educational tourism. The learning concept of study tour program is presented in Figure 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Vredeburg Fort Museum organizes educational tourism with the concept of mutual cooperative learning for learners, Vredeburg Fort Museum, and local communities (Urias and Russo, 2009). Cooperative education is a partnership between learners, educational institutions, and tourism service providers to meet educational goals and objectives in the form of historical learning experiences. Cooperative learning concepts integrate lessons in the classroom and in the practical experience space. Learning</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">in the classroom provides a basic knowledge of historical science to be studied at the Vredeburg Fort Museum. Practical space learning experiences take place at the Vredeburg Fort Museum to reinforce the knowledge of history that has been obtained in the classroom. Study tour at Vredeburg Fort Museum is well organized so that tourism products are offered not only as a source of information but a source of learning. The study tour program at Vredeburg Fort Museum considers some important elements, namely team planner, tourism content, event, local community involvement, tour operator, mass media, curriculum, teacher, educator, tour flow, and organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Research Contribution</span><span class="font3">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This research succeeds to design cooperative learning model of study tour program. The model can be implemented by educational institutions, tourism service providers, government, and other stakeholders to realize effective learning through study tour program.</span></p>
