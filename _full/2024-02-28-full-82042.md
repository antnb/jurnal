Since the introduction of Special theory of Relativity SR Lorentz invariance has been a fundamental part of our description of nature Over the past decades this Lorentz invariance was tested and verified by many research groups and almost no Lorentz violation have been found However when we look at the Lorentz transformations we can mathematically find that they are not symmetrical relations In fact the inertial frames are not symmetrical in relation to
