<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This paper deals with the phenomenon of famous tourism spot in Indonesia which were empowered by folktale through Instagram, such as: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Malin Kundang, Sangkuriang, Roro Jonggrang/Prambanan, Danau Toba,</span><span class="font1"> and many more. There was some research addressed the tourism spots, nevertheless there’s lack of research on cultural values of folktales in relation to tourism spots in Indonesia and how its aspects deal with its popularity and its marketing. With the development of social media, e.g., Instagram, it brings culture of tourism spot and literature works together and then uploaded it through series of pictures, captions, and stories. This research aimed to analyze the prominent cultural values of the famous tourism folktale spot in Indonesia and employed qualitative method through content analysis studies. The identification towards the Instagram captions on this research were categorized through cultural aspects based on “Four senses of Culture” by Adaskou, Britten, and Fahsi. Based on the cultural sense proposed, it is found 71.42% aesthetic culture sense, 42.85% sociological culture sense, 28.57% semantic culture sense, and last 14.28% pragmatic culture sense. From these findings it can be concluded that for the Instagram and folklore related content, photos alone it isn’t sufficient. To be more eye catching, viewers content enjoyer needs to be seduced with good captions, good hashtags, and storytelling as well. Further research might involve stories and music as background choice to be more precise and enticing in promoting folktale tourism.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">People love reading stories and children usually put them to sleep by reading bedtime stories to them. Every country has its own unique story which is passed down from generation to generation and thus resulting in the birth of folk stories. This kind of story usually developed from mouth to </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">mouth and the concept and aim of it is usually to entertain. Folktales are also a perfect example of how people in communities work and how people share and develop their culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By sharing folktales and folklore as oral tradition and as people share their stories, folktale and folklore, those habits and tradition also as a means of documenting, inventory, sharing cultural values. As</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">stated by Maharani (2018) a folktale, which is also written in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">folk tales</span><span class="font2">, is one of a kind of traditional story which basically grows and develops within the society since a long long time ago and has been inherited from one generation to the next through oral tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nevertheless, in this era of Coco Melon, My little pony, Netflix, Spongebob, Frozen, and many other popular movies and series for kids, folktales still haven’t lost its touch and still be used as learning materials and parents’ bedtimes stories even until today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Folktale and folklore stories are useful to be used as learning and teaching materials for language lessons and character education. The reason it would be great as learning and teaching materials are because they are entertaining, insightful, teach about life, culture, and tradition. Furthermore, Syafrony &amp;&nbsp;Suwanpratest (2016) stated that most folklore consisted of these 7 values, they are: gratitude, good karma, supernatural beliefs, holy spirit, men dominant, inner virtue, and role of woman and children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These are based on Asian folktales which are from Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, China, and Korea. Meanwhile, it’s viewed differently by Sarumpaet in Sa-rahtika (2018) which stated that most folktales usually display themes such as obedience, men’s wrath, women’s loyalty, envy and sibling rivalry, trickery and childishness. She also added that folktales also tend to be sexist, brutal, and celebrate female passivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the other hand, literature folktales do not always have negative contexts. Stories in literary folk tales tend to have additional moral depth over a simple one given by parents at home and classroom. The stories tell of moral issues; whereas good must be rewarded while evil does not and cannot pass unnoticed. Moral lessons through stories engage students' thoughts and emotions and can even </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">lead to the creation of mental images</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some famous literature works then created to be famous tourist spot such as Sherlock Holmes Museum in London, Harry Potter Museum in Disneyland Japan, Shakespeare, and Company in France and many more. Some tourist spots also developed the folklore and folktale behind their tourism spot to garner the visits from tourist. Stories vary from one region to another, from one people to the other: their kinds evanescence, or transform in the course of time. Change comes, as well as new species, but stories are being told all the time; they are a part of human life and socializing. Often, they are the soul of the place, that “something special” which makes the tourist destination in this ever-globalizing world differ from every other similar place, since more and more tourist destinations are becoming alike. That is material, true and authentic, created as a result of folk creativity, and that is what makes it unique. That is a part of a potential tourist destination’s personality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some famous tourism spot in Indonesia which was “enriched” with folktale are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Malin Kundang, Sangkuriang, Roro Jonggrang/Prambanan, Danau Toba, and many more.</span><span class="font2"> Almost all regions in Indonesia have attractive tourism potential, but not all of them are well narrated to tourists. Whereas according to Nur Alam in Bakti et al. (2019), the purpose of storytelling is to make a tourist attraction more attractive and make potential tourists curious. Therefore, marketing techniques using tourism storytelling are considered to have the opportunity to increase the number of tourist visits and foreign exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The right use of media during the Covid-19 pandemic is in digital media or online media forms. One of the social media that is widely used by Indonesian people today is Instagram. According to data released by NapoleonCat (2020), Instagram users in Indonesia in May 2020 reached 69.2 million users. Based on this</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">data and information, it can be said that currently Instagram is a social media that is very loved by the people of Indonesia. The use of Instagram in terms of business, of course Instagram has features that can make it easy for business people to promote their products or services online with a wide reach. When it is used as tourism promoting business through captions, then Instagram is one of the most popular places to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With the development of social media, IG or known as Instagram is also one of the most popular platforms which brings culture of tourism spot and literature works together and then uploaded it through series of pictures, captions, and stories. The tourism spot and combined it with the allure of the folktale's material and fruit of creativity and that's what makes it unique. It's part of the personality of a tourist destination and that is interesting to see it from the point of view of cultural values.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LITERATURE REVIEW</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Folktale</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Folktale is an example of folklore. Definition taken from Merriam-Webster stated that folktale is characteristically anonymous, timeless, and place less tale circulated orally among a people. This story is passed from generation to generation without knowing who the original author is and is usually spread by word of mouth. The folktale structure itself because it is part of a narrative text usually consists of 3 parts, namely orientation which is the initial part, complication where the character faces a problem or conflict and closes with a resolution where the problem faced by the character is resolved properly (Sayeef, 2019).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Related to the types of folklore, Bascom (1965) divided its type into three: myth, legend, and folktale. A folk tale, which is also written in popular ones, is</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">part of a kind of traditional story that grows basically develops within society for a long time and has been inherited from one generation to another the oral tradition. As the most common folk tale, folk is defined as a story, legend, or legend that is part of an oral tradition that has no single, identifiable author and the fact that it has been passed down from one generation to the next. orally, it changed over time, being reshaped by each storyteller, and often changed with each within a specific generation. Thus, various versions of the same folktale exist as a result of reshaping and retelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Exactly how to define what is or is not a popular tale is up for debate, but stories that fall into this category usually feature very distinct, such as beginning with &quot;There was once… &quot;, end with &quot;…and they all lived happily ever after&quot;. They traditionally feature fantastical elements as well as creatures such as giants, fairies, elves, and dwarfs. They are usually quite short, often taking only minutes to tell or read, and the plots often of melodramatic nature, featuring a hero and villain conflict where everything ends, good triumphs and justice is well served.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Instagram</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Taken from Instagram Help Center (Instagram, 2022) it was stated that Instagram is a free photo and video sharing app available on iPhone and Android. People can upload photos or videos to our service and share them with their followers or with a selected group of friends. They can also view, comment and like posts shared by their friends on Instagram. Anyone aged 13 and over can create an account by registering an email address and selecting a username. Whereas Instagram caption is something that you place next to your post that gives context to your images and allows you to share your brand voice. Good Instagram captions make posts more memorable by telling your followers how to </span><span class="font1">e-ISSN 2407-392X. p-ISSN 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">take action or laying the foundations for a stronger relationship. The right Instagram caption even makes your content more shareable.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Cultural Values</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Cultural resources become tourist attractions through a planned process, while the interpretative process and the design of the “packaging” were created to present the brand to the public. Interpretation is the very essence or main content of one that is sold, while packaging is not merely transformation helping to promote or simplify. It is precise that stories and storytelling can become a “brand” during that process. Unless it becomes a brand, heritage does not interest tourists. If designed and interpreted correctly, traditional heritage becomes a realistic tourist attraction and a reason for tourists to travel. This is why the experience must not only be one of entertainment, but it must also intrigue us with enigma, convey a message to us and offer us. The total experience is created only when you also include emotions (Alic, 2020).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Promotion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Philip Kotler (2000) defines promotion as an activity carried out by companies to communicate the benefits of their products and to convince consumers to buy. Cummins (1991) defines promotion as a set of techniques used to achieve sales or marketing goals in a cost-effective manner, by providing added value to products or services either to intermediaries or direct users. It is usually not limited to a certain period of time. These things can be achieved by using promotional tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Moreover, Shimp, et al. (2004) elaborates promotion has functions such as: Informing (providing information), Persuading (persuade), Reminding (reminder), and Adding Value (adding value). Eventually, this research aimed to analyze the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">prominent cultural values of the famous tourism folktale spot in Indonesia.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">This research employed Qualitative approach through content analysis studies. Mohajan (2018) argues that research Qualitative is one form of action social media that emphasizes how to interpret and understand experience as a way of understanding the social reality of the individual. Neuman, et al. (2014) explains that researchers in the study of content analysis, doing collection and analysis of text content. As for researchable content consists of words, meaning, image, symbol, idea, theme, or message communicated. Therefore, this research will use textual analysis and will look at the cultural values through Instagram post and their captions which related to folktale of tourism spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are four dimensions of culture based on “Four senses of Culture” by Adaskou, Britten, and Fahsi (Adaskou, Britten, &amp;&nbsp;Fahsi, 1990). The first dimension is called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the aesthetic sense</span><span class="font2">; the second is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a sociological sense</span><span class="font2">, the third is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">semantic sense</span><span class="font2">, which refers to the conceptualized system that is Incorporated in the language and the last is pragmatic sense. The last is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sociolinguistic or pragmatic sense</span><span class="font2">. It covers skills in social situations, background knowledge, and paralinguistic skills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Therefore, the identification towards the Instagram captions will be categorized through cultural aspects such as: the aesthetic sense (refers to media, cinema, music with popular or traditional genres, and literature.), the sociological sense (relates to the organization and nature of family, home life, interpersonal relations, material condition, work and leisure, customs, and finally, institutions), the semantic sense (refers to the conceptualized system that is incorporated in the language) and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">pragmatic sense (It is covering skills in social situations, background knowledge, and paralinguistic skills).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Like most other social media, Instagram is also easily accessible from smartphones and has become an existence booster among young people. Instagram is one form of the result of the advancement of the internet and is classified as one of the social media that is quite loved by today's audiences. By taking advantage of this, the opportunity to promote tourist attractions can be easier because of the large number of potential consumers who gather on Instagram social media. One of the strengths in promotion through Instagram as a business medium is to use hashtags where several features on Instagram that can be used for promotion include: Followers (Followers) and Follows (Following), Uploading Photos/Videos with Captions (Posting), In-stastory and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Instagram has a caption feature or captions in every photo that is posted. For tourists who visit tourist attractions with</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">folklore appeal, they can use their own caption feature as detailed information that can be an attraction for each post on their respective Instagram accounts. They tend to use informal language that is easy to understand and understand in their post captions. Or even retell folktale stories that happened in that place. Example is this caption used by someone who visited Malin Kun-dang tourism spot “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Don’t rebel towards your mother, then you will become a stone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The results of findings the Instagram captions cultural values related to the folktale of tourism spots are: the IG post which has clear caption, used hashtags, and depict the clear view of the related. tourism spot folktale</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Based on the four sense of culture framework proposed by Adaskou, Britten and Fahsi (1990), the culture is categorized into four senses: the aesthetic sense, the sociological sense, the semantic sense, and the pragmatic sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The aesthetic sense of culture</span><span class="font2"> refers to the media, the cinema, music, and above all literature-research. This is the most used in the instagram caption that were used because findings based on the hashtag or #. It was found that posts captioning hashtag related to the tourism spots of Malin Kundang, Sangkuring, Prambanan, Legenda Batu Menangis and Legenda Kawah Sikidang. All were retelling the story or behind the story of the folktale in their caption Instagram posts. These captions clearly explain the folktale in their posts along with the picture or illustration of the folktale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Whereas </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the sociological sense of culture</span><span class="font2"> refers to the organization and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">nature of family, home life, of interpersonal relations, material conditions, work, and leisure, custom, and institutions.

<p><span class="font2">addition to mastery of the language code, make possible successful communication. In this instagram caption post from Pram-banan where the user is explaining the story of Prambanan and especially the lack of communication between Roro and Bandung Bondowoso hence the pragmatic cultural sense is found on this caption.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informing (providing information)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">For informing, Instagram is a great and easy place to do so. For tourists who went there and put captions and photos and even illustration to explain and informing to others on how the place looks like.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persuading (persuade)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">For other form of promotion, Instagram caption to tourism related spot can persuade others to visit the place as well. c) Reminding (reminder)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Whereas in reminding, this can be one way during Pandemic. Instagram captions posts serve as reminder for people when certain tourism spots are already open for public and such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">d) Adding Value (adding value)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In promoting part for adding value, Parsi (Parsi, 2021) stated that 48% of people choose their destination based on what they see on Instagram and 35% of them discover new places to visit from Instagram. Therefore, the more tourism folklore related posts and its caption seen by people, the more people will come to the tourism spot as well.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Folktales and folklore continue to captivate society and remain a popular subject. This is evident through the growth of tourist spots inspired by folktales, although they may not be as well-known as other &quot;instagrammable&quot; locations. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Instagram remains a widely used social media platform, particularly in Indonesia. It can serve as a powerful promotional tool for folklore-related tourist destinations, as it allows users to share captivating visuals, thought-provoking captions, and relevant hashtags, thereby enticing more visitors to explore these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The study emphasizes the significance of cultural values and content in folktales when promoting tourism spots through Instagram. To create effective posts, clear and appealing photos should be accompanied by well-written captions that relate to the content. Captions can range from summarizing the folktale or folklore to storytelling, while including interesting hashtags to enhance post visibility. Furthermore, in order to further enhance promotion, Instagram users can explore creative methods such as incorporating additional stories and music into their posts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Overall, Instagram offers a valuable platform for promoting tourism, and when combined with cultural sensibilities and creative approaches, it can significantly boost the visibility and appeal of folklore-related tourist destinations</span></p>
