Aging is a natural life process Aging is associated with oxidative stress that results in decreased function and structural organs including mitochondria Nuclear Factor E2 related factor 2 NRF2 is the master regulator of antioxidants NRF2 can suppress the damage caused by oxidative stress Our purpose is to see the correlation between exercise in improving NRF2 and efficacy to prevent aging This paper is a literature review journal Sources of data obtained
