The research method used in completing this research becomes the descriptive qualitative method.

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Language is a human verbal communication tool that is traditionally used by speakers to express something in order for other people or individuals to understand what they want to say. (Marzuki, 2016 ; Marzuki, 2019) in Haucsa et al., (2020: 1) states by using language, people will be able to share and express their ideas, thoughts, and feelings. So, the listener is needed to efficiently interpret the speaker's utterances to apprehend the speaker's supposed means because the failure to determine the right meaning can cause misunderstanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pragmatics is a branch of linguistics that examines how the meaning of language is modified depending on the circumstances. Semantics is also a study of meaning, but its significance is context-free, which implies that the speech does not depend on the situation in which it is said. The researcher analyzes using pragmatic theory because pragmatics examines the speaker's intention which is explicitly or implicitly behind an utterance. Yule (1996: 3) cited in Mufiah &amp;&nbsp;Rahman (2018: 2) “Pragmatics is the study of contextual meaning”. It has for that reason extra to do with the evaluation of what people suggest by their utterances than what the terms or phrases in those utterances may want to imply thru themselves. It implies that language is a way of involving individuals in activities in order for them to communicate. Pragmatics has a branch, namely speech act which is useful for reading the use of words and their meanings in communication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Language is not just used to talk or communicate something; it may additionally be used to do something or affect a person. Yule (1996: 47) in Mufiah &amp;&nbsp;Rahman (2018: 2) states that speech acts are actions that are carried out through speech. Speech acts are defined in linguistic analysis as what individuals do when they utter words. According to the notion, humans generate an utterance as a type of action. Wijana (2021: 1) explains about speech acts are classified into three: locutionary,illocutionary, and perlocutionary. The first is concerned with the act</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of expressing something, the second with the act of doing something, and the third with the act of impacting someone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this research, the researcher does not discuss speech acts in general, but instead focuses more on analysis of illocutionary acts as a type of speech acts. Illocutionary acts are crucial to comprehending speech acts since each action has a specific purpose and function. Searle (1979) classified 5 well-known classes of illocutionary acts. Assertive about providing an understanding of the situation in humans, Directive about making a situation where other people do something, Commisive about dedication to do something, Expressive about conveying things inside oneself such as feelings and attitudes, and Declaration about a change that occurs in the world due to our words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maulidiyah et al., (2021: 2) states that everyone has the capability of making statements, offers, and explanations for various communication purposes including in the field of politics. In the area of politics, speech acts are employed to advantage political assist. In this regard, it is apparent that uttering the speech act may be politicians' political acts, which can be channeled up through language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">America, or officially the United States of America (USA) is a superpower whose actions influence the whole world. America ranks #1 in the 2021 Military Strength Ranking based on Global Firepower (GFP). America's influence extends not only to the military but also to the economy, culture, and foreign policy. Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., also known as Joe Biden, is an American politician and the current President of the united states. On his centesimal day as President of the united states, he delivered several remarks in his first address to the joint Congress on April 28, 2021. For example, he said in his speech &quot;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again; turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength.</span><span class="font4">&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vol. 29 No.1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From his statement, “</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">America is on the move again</span><span class="font4">” we can know that it means he reported to the country about his performance during his 100 days as America’s President that he made America better by turning danger into possibility, crisis into opportunity and setbacks into strength. In line with Searle's taxonomy of illocutionary acts, ‘report’ belongs to the assertive type. We will conclude that illocutionary acts occur within the speech. So, the researcher believes that it is important to analyze speech acts contained in the presidential speech, particularly illocutionary acts because they play important role in studying the hidden meanings in President Joe Biden's speech to avoid misunderstanding of the speech. President Joe Biden as President of America where America is a superpower, so his speech as a leader can influence other countries. As a result, being able to grasp the context is critical in understanding the meaning of a speech. This research will focus on understanding the meaning in speech so that it can be understood as a complete message to be conveyed precisely and accurately.</span></p>

The data are the words found in the speech and analyze the use of the speech act theory proposed by Searle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Inline with (Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña 2014), in analyzing this research, the researcher organized the data into three parallel flows of activity: (1) data condensation, (2) data display, and (3) conclusion drawing/verification.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The directive is a kind of speech act that reflects the speaker's try to get the other individual to do something. They express the speaker's desire for the recipient to do something such as commands, requests, questions, advice, and orders. By using this type, the speaker aims to get some future action on the part of the recipient, thus making the world fit the words of the receiver. Example ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“After 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff, in my view. We’re working again, dreaming again, discovering again, and leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world that there’s no quit in America, none.” (Directives of requesting)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">As the result of analyzing the illocutionary act that is found in Joe Biden speech we can identify the most dominant types of illocutionary acts, by using Nawawi’s formula in Wardana et al., (2019). The formula is :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">X = × 100%</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">X = The percentage of illocutionary act discovered in the speech</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Y = The number of illocutionary act that had been analyzed</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">N = The total of illocutionary act that had been found</span></p>
