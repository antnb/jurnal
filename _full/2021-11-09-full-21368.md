<p><span class="font3">In this advertisement clause that is found in the headline is “Everyday is a sale!”. This clause is categorized as declarative clause types. Since this clause has its meaning to declare a situation of the outlet. Although this clause is ended by an exclamation point, it is not an exclamative clause types. In the other hand the speech act studies of this advertisement is divided into two parts. Speech act type of this advertisement divided into three. Locutionary of “Everyday is a sale!” is to tell the readers there is a sale held everyday in the outlet. Its Illocutionary is to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">persuade the reader to come over the outlet everyday and purchase the stuffs, since there is a sale in the outlet. The perlocutionary of that clause is could be resulting the readers come and purchasing the stuffs everyday. Based on Cohen’s theories (1996), there are five categories of speech acts based on the functions assigned to them. In “Everyday is a sale!” clause it has its function to make the readers to something, in the condition of purchasing the products in the outlet since the advertiser advertises a sale is held everyday. The speech act function for this clause is categorized as directives speech act function.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In the non-commercial advertisement above clauses are found in its headline and bodycopy. They are “Put it in a bin, dude!” and “The buck stops with each and every one of us”. “Put it in a bin, dude!” has its literal meaning to ask the readers to put the garbage in a bin. That literal meaning is categorized as locutionary meaning. Then its illocutionary meaning is to make a request to the readers to keep the environment clean by put the garbage in a bin. Besides, that clause has its meaning to ask the readers to not throw the garbage away and better to put it in a proper place.

In term of speech act studies, speech act</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">function, Cohen’s idea is divided into five major categories of speech act function. This speech act function is covered the intention which is delivered by the advertiser. This clause in the speech act function is categorized as directives speech act function</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font3">The second clause is “The buck stops with each and every one of us”.

After those explanations the analysis goes on to the Cohen’s theories (1996) about speech act function. The analysis concern to the meaning that wants to deliver as a function of the clause is being conveyed about.
