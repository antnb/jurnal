<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">— Data center of Udayana University has not been integrated yet, so that it caused excessive power usage. Thus, a green data center system has to be implemented to make the power usage more efficient and eco-friendly. This study aims to find out the energy consumption of the data center in Udayana University; and to design the data center based on the criteria and standards of the green data center. Data of this study were collected by conducting a direct survey to the data center, interviewing the IT staffs and analysing the data center conditions. Then, green metrics calculations were conducted, including Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and Data Center Infrastructure Efficiency (DCIE) in addition to designing the green data center. This study reveals that the energy consumption in the data center is 104.231 w. in which the PUE calculation is 2,51 included as an inefficient categorization and the DCIE calculation is 39% that means the power usage efficiency is 39 %. Relying on the results, servers grouping is redesigned to minimize the cable usage and to make the checking activities easier, using a raised floor based on designed cooling systems, using 3 phase electrical systems to balance the load distributed, and redesigning the cooling system by using a row oriented cooling system and the cabling system in the data center. By designing the green data center in Udayana University, it is expected that the energy consumption could be significantly reduced and the efficiency could be increased.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark3"></a>I.</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The data center is the central storage, physical or virtual media storage, management, and deletion of data and information from the certain knowledge. The data center is a collection of server or computer room. [1]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The data center at the University of Udayana use a lot of power, used to run the main device and to cool the equipment. Therefore, need data center management to be more efficient and more environmentally friendly energy called green data center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Green data center similar to the data center which are used for media storage, management, and distribution data. The difference is the hardware, the electricity, and computer systems. All designed to achieve maximum efficiency and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">minimal environmental impact [1]. Green data center means sustainable data center efficiently in the process, energy, and equipment used [2].</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Research was conducted on data center located in GDLN (Global Development Learning Network) Udayana University. This data center serve data access across the campus of the University of Udayana at Sudirman, Jalan Pulau Nias and Jimbaran.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Data center at Udayana University is not well integrated and caused the cost is high enough to maintenance.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark5"></a>II.</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Center</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Data center is a facility used to place a computer system and its related components, such as telecommunications and data storage systems. This facility typically consists of redundant power or a backup, redundant data communication connections, environmental control, fire prevention, as well as physical security devices. The data center also covers a server storage for a website or database.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The data center is managed by the administrator. Good management of data center supports the entire performance of the network, which both support the entire performance of the network, from the use of the application, therefore the rules and standards of measurement is critical of the use of applications, from data center administration [3].</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Center Component</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Based on “Classification of Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) Tools” paper [4], the data center has a term used to describe and differentiate center infrastructure, data management and classification system as shown in table 1.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criteria for Designing Data Center</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">In the planning of the data center, should consider the following criteria:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability. The data center was created to be able to provide sustainable operations and continuous for a company either in normal circumstances and in case of the occurrence of a significant damage or not. Data centers should be made as far as possible closer to zero failure for all of its components.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scalability and Flexibility. The data center should be able to adapt to the needs of rapid growth or when the new services to be provided by the data center without making a significant change to the data center as a whole.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security. The data centers storing valuable corporate asset, therefore the security system is made as tightly as possible both securing physical and non-physical security [5].</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Center Standard.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">In this study used TIA-942 standard to designing a data center. Telecommunications Industry Association's TIA-942 is a standard that specifies minimum requirements for telecommunications infrastructure of data centers and computer rooms. Topology proposed in this standard are intended to be applied in any size data center. This standard was first published in 2005, after the cable structured work defined in TIA / EIA-568, and is often cited by companies such as ADC Telecommunications and Cisco Systems. In April 2005, responding to the TIA standards TIA-942 infrastructure, data center first standard to specifically address the data center infrastructure. Intended for use by data center designers in the building process, TIA-942 includes the space and layout, cabling infrastructure, tiered reliability, and environmental aspects. [6].</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Center Cooling System</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">According to Neil Rasmussen [7], which need to be considered in designing the cooling system is a clear path from the source to the cooling server / device in the data center. There are 3 types of air distribution flow occurs, ie</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">flooded, locally ducted, and fully ducted. Can be seen in Figure 1.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/20372-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:251pt;height:290pt;">
<p><span class="font2">Figure 1: Flow Cooling On Data Center [7].</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Determining the needs of the cooling system needed for a data center is required input of the amount of heat generated by IT devices and other heat sources in the data center. measurement requirements using the standard wattage.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Data Center</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Green data center is a repository for the storage, management, and dissemination of data in which the mechanical, lighting, electrical and computer systems are designed for maximum energy efficiency and produce minimal environmental impacts [2].</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Green data center similar to the data center which are used for media storage, management, and distribution data. The difference is the hardware, the electricity, and computer systems. All designed to achieve maximum efficiency and minimal environmental impact [8].</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Metrics</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Green metrics are metrics that evaluate the energy efficiency of a mobile communication system. Green metrics can be divided into two types of metrics level of equipment, and facility-level metrics [8]. In this study, green metrics used are Power Usage Efectiveness (PUE) and Data Center Infrastructure Efficiency (DCiE) offered by the Green Grid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PUE is the total power used for all equipment in the data center divided by the power used for its IT devices.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In this study, the first thing to do is analysing the condition of the data center by conducting a direct survey to the data center and interviewing the IT staffs. A journal study method is also used as the basis of proposals in this study. Data and theories are the reference as well as other related research taken from books, journals and papers. The method used is to make modelling design of green data center in order to make the data center efficient in terms of the electricity consumption of the cooling system and the hardware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, the green metrics are calculated. This method is used to determine the level of the green data center design. There are two metrics used that are the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and Data Center Infrastructure Efficiency (DCIE).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this study, the development of the current green data has no signs that expressly or clearly. So that all the components that support the development of the green data center is concluded into the Green Data Center Best Practices.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Center Design Recommendation</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">From the analysis of the existing conditions, the researcher gets an idea to design Udayana University data center in order to minimize the electric power consumption in order to save costs and support green data center movement. The design can be done starting from the data center room, server clustering, raised floor design, installation of electrical systems design, re-design the cooling system and cabling system based on TIA-942 Data Center Standard.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Center Room of Udayana University</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Determining the location for the data center is important because that location must can be developed. Consideration of the location is the most important requirement that must be met to anticipate IT needs are always increasing, especially the addition of hardware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the data center of Udayana University, the room used is 5.45x12 m. The room size 5.45x12 m assumed to be sufficient for the development of data center Udayana University for 15 years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Server Clustering</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Servers clustering is employed according to the functions, types and applications of each device. This server clustering serves to minimize the use of cables and also to facilitate checking when interference with the server.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raised Floor Design</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Data center construction begins with the installation of raised floor. In the design of raised floor made attention to several factors. The first is the height of the floor. There are several factors that affect the height of the floor is ideal for raised floor, including the size and shape of the server environment, the amount of equipment at its maximum capacity, how much cold air that want to pass up, and how much of the infrastructure that will be passed under the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The second factor is the ability to withstand the load floor. More weight can be tolerated by the data center floor. Figure 4 illustrates the design of raised floor using concrete materials or concrete slab, pedestal thermal material and glue on the base of the foundation. The distance from the ground to the tiles is 50 cm. The distance determination takes into account the number of cables and air flow through the raised floor.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/20372-6.jpg" alt="" style="width:209pt;height:112pt;">

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation of Electrical System Design</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Electricity in the data center is supplied by PLN. Because of the amount of the electric power required, it takes 3 phase electrical installations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">3 phase electrical installation is divided proportionally between the server rack and cooling. Line phase R is used for cooling equipment, line phase sequence S is used for upper</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">rack and line phase T is used to lower the rack rows each of 50A. As shown in Figure 5.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/20372-7.jpg" alt="" style="width:160pt;height:148pt;">
<p><span class="font4">In the design of electrical systems (power) will be used trench (Tray inside the raised floor) as well as the tray is located just below the main roof. NYY type of cable used as sufficient to conduct electricity to each device, and also more secure because there is a system that can strengthen holder hook wires on the connector. Each rack is connected to the electrical system, given ceeform connector to flow of electric current.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redesign Cooling System</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">From several existing cooling systems, the cooling conditions that exist in the data center of Udayana University is the room-oriented cooling system, the author makes the design of the cooling method that is row-oriented cooling system. Row oriented cooling system design at Udayana University can be seen in Figure 6.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/20372-8.jpg" alt="" style="width:217pt;height:96pt;">

<p><span class="font4">Hot aisle is indicated by red arrows, while the cold aisle is indicated by the blue arrows. CRAC position is on hot aisle path to be the rising hot air can be inhaled by CRAC without mixing with cold air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cold air flowed through the cold aisle, created under the floor to the front of the server rack. Then the cold air is inhaled by the server to reduce the heat in the server and air heat discharged to the rear rack server. After the hot air will rise up and be inhaled by CRAC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This method is more efficient because the cold air that is inhaled by the server are not mixed by hot air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With row oriented cooling system, level of power consumption on cooling in the data center of Udayana University can dropped significantly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">the routing International Exchange or Indonesian Internet Exchange (IIX). Of a BGP router is connected (bridging) with a bandwidth manager for the distribution of bandwidth to each ip transit owned by Udayana. Bandwidth manager is connected to the router. At this router is connected to the 14 pieces of the server that functions as the application service provider. Then from the router connected to the nut to be connected to a bandwidth manager is then connected to the switch 4700. From 4700 switches, each output to the faculty building on the campus of Udayana Sudirman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here the researcher has designed a new cabling system for the data center. Figure 9 is the design of data center cabling system at Udayana University.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/20372-11.jpg" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:207pt;">
<p><span class="font2">Figure 9: New cabling system design of Udayana University data center</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was little difference in the new design. Where 14 servers causing consume a lot of power and infrastructure is needed. Therefore the new cabling is designed to use 4 server cloud to conserve power and infrastructure equipment used. By using cloud servers, data security can be maintained.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation of Power Consumption After Design</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">After designing a green data center at Udayana University, showed that the total power used 58.995w while its power to IT equipment that is 27.565w.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reduction of the number of devices such as ups, ac, servers, switches, routers and storage. Reduction in the number of ac become one due to the design of the new cooling system that is row-oriented cooling system. This system allows the device is standing ac to distribute cool air into two rows of server racks. On the server device to deliberately reduce the number of devices using the cloud system server. This system maximizes the performance of the device server so that multiple servers can be combined into a single cloud server. It will affect the use of power, cabling, and more efficient. From results obtained, it can be calculated Green Metrics PUE (1) and DCIE (2).</span></p>
