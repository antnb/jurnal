<p><span class="font4">This is a quantitative descriptive research.

The participants of this research were 11 of the fifth semester students of STKIP Paracendekia NW Sumbawa. Data collecting instrument used structurally arranged questionnaires, and written test. The data was analyzed by quantitative method. The data analyzed technique employed descriptive statistics through percentage techniques. The result of the research showed that there were 8 students or 72.73% gain in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">best </span><span class="font4">category level of skill, there were 3 students or 27.27% gain in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">good </span><span class="font4">category level of skill</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font4">and the mean score was 81.27 in the level of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">best </span><span class="font4">category</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font4">Data from questionnaire, 9 students with 81.82% stated they strongly agreed that the implementation of group class presentation more active during teaching and learning process of writing essay.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intruduction</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">English is one of the most important languages which is used in many countries as the mean of communication. In line with Manafe (2020) states that in this globalization era, the role of English in various aspects of life becomes more dominant and very important. She further argues this language is also used as a communication tool to conduct relations between countries around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">English as a foreign language for Indonesian students makes the subject of writing become more difficult for the EFL learners. Consequently, students may have difficulties in doing this activity because it involves multifaceted process such as produce a particular feeling or impression, arrangement, script, and refinement. According to Sabilah (2018: 5) teaching English as a foreign language in Indonesia requires an intensive attention to make learners euphoric and excited to learn and must be fully oriented to maintain their English mastery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Ristati, Suparwa, Sudipa &amp;&nbsp;Dhanawaty (2019) that the teaching of English subject in Indonesian schools includes four skills, namely listening, speaking, reading, and writing. In learning a new language, there are four skills must be mastered by learners. One of skill taught in English teaching is English writing skill. In line with Susilawati (2017) that writing skill is one skill that needs to be developed in English teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Writing is an activity or work of writing books, poems, stories and so on (Perrault, 2008). Writing is one of the most difficult skill for ESL and EFL learners in English language learning. According to Rass (2001) that writing is a difficult skill for native speakers and non-native speakers; because writers must be able write it in multiple issues such as content, organization, purpose, audience, vocabularies and mechanics such as punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. It supported by Perkins &amp;&nbsp;Brutten (1990) state that writing ability should be learned as a whole rather than as a series as a separate element. In line with Falk (1979), state that when a student writes a composition, he/she is involved with all aspects of language during the process of composing a piece of writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact showed that most students’ collage has not been able to write English well. One reason is that English is not the language of instruction as well as Malaysia which had English as a language of instruction in the country (Alwasilah, 1985). This makes the learners only learn the language at school during English lessons take place. Besides, with a monotonous learning method, then English becomes a boring subject for them, especially in writing class learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The phenomena above also occurred in the fifth semester students of STKIP Paracendekia NW Sumbawa. English writing essay ability of these students from semester to semester is still low. This can be seen in such cases like when students try to express their ideas in English writing essay. The students l</span><span class="font2">ack of exploring activity or ideas in making their writing essay skill well. </span><span class="font4">As stated by Rohmah (2009) the lack of exploring activity influenced the students’ writing skill, especially skill in organizing their ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These problems above can be overcome by applying new strategies, and innovation method in teaching. Teachers should use different ways of teaching writing to improve the students writing skill. In line with Franata, Simpen, &amp;&nbsp;Dhanawaty (2020) that language learning can be made easier by applying several learning approaches. Therefore, the researcher would try to improve students’ writing essay ability through class group presentation. According to Slavin (1995) that learning in group can develop self-confidence, sympathy, and love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the background above, the issues can be formulated as follows; to what extent the influence of class presentation to improve essay writing students’ ability of the fifth semester of STKIP Paracendekia NW Sumbawa?</span></p>
