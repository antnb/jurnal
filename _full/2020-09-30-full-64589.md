<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In accordance with the direction of the President of the Republic of Indonesia Joko Widodo, which is to develop Indonesia from the periphery with regions and villages within the framework of unity is with the idea of a village and Tourist, and then the idea of a tourist village emerged. This directive succeeded in elevating several villages to become tourist destinations. Through village development, it is hoped that rural communities will gain insight into awareness of the protection of the natural environment, sustainable culture, and be able to empower the available resources, remain diligent in carrying out daily habits, and carry out their main livelihood. So that it is expected to be a tourist attraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This type of special interest Tourist can be offered in a tourist village, where there is more emphasis on experiential elements and active Tourist that involves tourists in direct contact with the surrounding community. One of the villages that is currently developing local cultural Tourist with its trademark Cimande Silat is the Cimande Tourist Village located in Caringin District, Bogor Regency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Cimande Village is a developing Tourist village located in Bogor Regency, famous for its medical Tourist 'fracture</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">massage’ and culture Tourist 'Pencak Silat'. In this location, various human activities are centralized, both local residents, patients seeking treatment, patient companions, tour operators, and visitors / tourists. Activities carried out directly and indirectly cause damage to the environment, such as piles of organic waste and plastic waste, rubbish scattered on the side of the road. If this condition is not immediately addressed, it can threaten the environment and sustainable community life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Cleanliness is an environmental condition that displays a free atmosphere, from dirt, garbage, sewage and pollution. The pollution factor or vision of tourists in terms of cleanliness in a location or village environment will affect the interest of the tourists to return or no longer to the location or village. To realize the interest of tourists visiting an area, it can be realized with Sapta Pesona. The community should be able to create a beautiful atmosphere of enchanting, clean as well as create interesting and comfortable conditions and atmosphere for the tourists. Clean, where Tourist Village provides conditions that show clean and hygienic properties such as environmental conditions, Tourist facilities, service equipment and human beings who provide such services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The volume of waste generation always increases with the increase in population. Based on information from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK), the national waste generation amount reaches 175,000 tons per day if using the assumption that 0.7 kg of waste produced per person per day is assumed. The total population of Cimande Village is 6,800 people, so the assumption of the amount of waste generated by multiplying the assumption of waste generated by each person per day is 4,760 kg per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Preventing the implementation of landfills and environmental damage is necessary for waste management at Cimande Tourist Village. As a developing Tourist village, village communities who need awareness in waste management, this research aims to monitor the distribution and volume of waste at this Village, the waste management evaluation system that has been carried out, and environmental management at Cimande Tourist village which is free of waste. Through a community-based Tourist approach, it is hoped that the community will be wiser in managing and a sustainable village environment free of waste. As a Tourist village, the application of the Sapta Pesona concept is important in its foundation because it can encourage public awareness to be good hosts. In addition, the application of Sapta Pesona will also attract </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font2">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;351</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">tourists to an area, thereby increasing the role of the community as the maximum beneficiary of the development of Tourist activities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LITERATURE REVIEW</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Sapta Pesona</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In order to attract his interest in visiting an area, Sapta Pesona can be realized. The community must be able to create a beautiful, enchanting atmosphere and create attractive and comfortable conditions and atmosphere for tourists. Tourists will feel at home staying longer, satisfied with their visit and giving beautiful memories in their life. The seven elements of Sapta Pesona, namely: (1) Safety, where a condition that can be felt and experienced a safe atmosphere, free</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">from threats, disturbances, and acts of violence and crime, is protected, (2) Orderliness, which provides conditions that reflect orderly and orderly and discipline in all aspects of community life both in terms of vehicle traffic, use of facilities as well as in various other community behaviors, (3) Cleanliness, where the conditions are clean and hygienic in both environmental conditions, Tourist facilities, service equipment and human beings provide these services, (4) Cool Atmosphere, providing a fresh, cool and comfortable atmosphere because of regular and beautiful reforestation both in the form of parks and greening in each residential environment, (5) Beauty, which provides beauty, conditions that reflect the arrangement that orderly, orderly and harmonious both regarding infrastructure, facilities, use of a harmonious color scheme, in harmony with de with the environment and showing national personality traits, (6) Friendliness, which provides warm hospitality, namely the attitude and behavior of people who are friendly and polite in communicating, providing services and helping hands without strings attached; (7) Memories, which give memories, namely pleasant impressions and will always be remembered.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Waste</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Garbage is solid, solid waste or waste which is a byproduct of urban areas or the life cycle of humans, animals or plants. Garbage is goods that are not used and wasted or items whose owner / user or ordered have been disposed of with the intention of not being taken away (Kodoatie, 2005; Siahaan, 2016). According to the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) Number T-13-1990, what is meant by waste is solid waste containing useless organic and inorganic substances and must be managed so that it does not apply to the environment and protect building investment.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Waste Management</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the Regional Regulation of Bogor Regency Number 2 of 2014, waste is the residue of human daily activities and / or natural processes in solid form, consisting of household waste and household-like waste. If waste management does not receive serious attention and is only considered a &quot;small thing&quot; for the community and is not managed seriously, it will become &quot;big and scary&quot; in the future. In order to achieve optimal solid waste services, it is time for a paradigm shift in waste management. According to the Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 18 of 2008 concerning waste management, it is a comprehensive and continuous systematic</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">activity which includes waste reduction and handling. Waste management is a process that needs to be done with the aim of converting waste into something that has economic value and breaking waste into something that is not endangering the environment (Masjhoer, 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To achieve optimal solid waste services, it is time for a transformative paradigm shift in waste management at Cimande Tourist Village. The transformative paradigm is the concept of waste management at Cimande Tourist Village, which can prevent or minimize pollution and other negative impacts that are detrimental to society and the environment. According to (Witoelar, 2006; Siahaan, 2016) new policies are needed to change the paradigm of waste management from the end of pipe approach, namely disposing of waste directly to the landfill towards waste management with the 3R principle, namely Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. Waste management policy emphasizes reducing waste at its source, sorting and recycling. The initial step that is very important in changing this paradigm is to change the policy towards minimizing waste at its source, not at its disposal.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The Impact of Tourist on the Environment</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Tourist can have a negative or positive impact on the environment, depending on the planning and management of Tourist development in a destination (Gee, 1997; Masjhoer, 2017). General impacts arising from Tourist (Inskeep, 1991; Masjhoer, 2017):</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positively impact. If Tourist has good planning and management, it can maintain and improve environmental conditions in various ways. Positive impacts of Tourist, namely: conservation of protected areas, conservation of archaeological and historical sites, improvement of environmental quality, improvement of the environment, improvement of infrastructure, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increasing</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">environmental awareness.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative impact. Tourist development that does not have proper planning, development and management will have a negative impact on the environment. The negative impacts may vary depending on the type of Tourist development and the specific environmental characteristics of the Tourist area. The relationship between the scale of Tourist development and the carrying capacity of the environment greatly affects the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">expansion of the resulting environmental impacts. The negative impacts of Tourist are water pollution, air pollution, noise, visual pollution, waste problems, ecological disturbances, damage to archaeological and historical sites, and land use problems.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Coaching</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Coaching from a humanist perspective is person-centered principles, it views positive change and selfactualization as a driving force in the human psyche (Roger, 1959; Ives, 2008). Behavior based approach, advocates a behavioral approach that acknowledges the complexity of both the human being and her environment, but which nevertheless focuses on facilitating practical change over psychological adjustments. This approach is action focused insofar as it looks to the future and seeks to create change and imbed it in real life contexts, but it still leans heavily towards personal development, emphasizing the need for client learning, and to a lesser degree adopts a therapeutic emphasis on the coaching relationship (Stober, Wildflower, &amp;&nbsp;Drake, 2006; Ives, 2008).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to (Whitmore, 2003; Ives, 2008) portrays coaching as “optimizing people’s potential and performance.”. To coach means to convey </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font2">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font3">a valued colleague from where he or she is to where he or she wants to be (Evered &amp;&nbsp;Selman, 1989; Ives, 2008), “to focus, motivate and support others in achieving their goal” (Parsloe &amp;&nbsp;Wray, 2000; Ives, 2008), “collaborative solution-focused, result-orientated and systematic process in which the coach facilitates the enhancement of life experience and goal attainment in the personal and/or professional life of normal, non-clinical clients (Grant, 2003; Ives, 2008). Coaching is an intervention aimed at helping the coaches to focus on and achieve their clearly defined goals. The coach uses open-ended questions to provoke thought, raise awareness, and to inspire motivation and commitment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The distribution of the generated waste at Cimande Village accumulates in almost every RT (neighborhood). Each RT (neighborhood) has at least one illegal landfill (garbage dump). However, there are several RT (neighborhood) that have more than one illegal garbage dump, such as RT 08 which has 5 illegal dumping points. So that in the entire village there are 20 illegal landfill garbage dumps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Local waste originating from household rubbish is a source of permanent waste generation, where the volume of waste is very large and relatively constant. Based on information from the Ministry of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Environment and Forestry (KLHK), the national waste generation amount reaches 175,000 tons per day if using the assumption that 0.7 kg of waste produced per person per day is assumed. The total population of Cimande Village is 6,800 people, so the assumption of the amount of waste generated by multiplying the assumption of waste generated by each person per day is 4,760 kg per day.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/64589-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:413pt;height:118pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Waste Management in Cimande Village Local government participation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The role and local government in the waste management strategy in the form of providing the necessary facilities and infrastructure, including the number of cleaners who act as implements every day is not yet visible. The unavailability of TPS (Temporary Disposal Sites) has resulted in the community dumping garbage in illegal dumpsites, such as in several garbage dumps that are in sewer airways or in landfills without permanent buildings in every neighborhood unit at Cimande Village. The accumulation of garbage that has never been collected becomes sedimentation so that it closes the airways of the sewers and even creates an unpleasant odor that pierces the residents' noses. The presence of black smoke and burns in what is called an illegal TPS (Temporary Disposal Site) and plastic, organic and other garbage mixed together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is no role and local government in waste management efforts at the Cimande Village through Coaching on waste management. The extension is an important part of providing knowledge about waste to the community, so that the community understands how importance of waste management and is willing to get involved in waste management strategies. Karang Taruna as a community social youth organization in Cimande Village has </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font2">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font3">just started to reactivate their activities in early 2020. One of the programs carried out by Karang Taruna is to help with waste management strategies in the form of taking garbage from house to house in several RT, namely in RT 01, 02, 03 and 06 due to personnel and funding limitations. Waste management activities began on June 15, 2020. The mechanism for collecting garbage from house to house by assigning five persons personnel cleaning for each RT, which is carried out every Wednesday night. The waste that is taken is then collected into sacks and then carried by the cleaning staff to be collected by the designated roadside. On Wednesday morning, DLH (Environmental Service) officers will transport the garbage sacks and bring them to the Leuwiliang TPA (Final Disposal Site).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The form of financing carried out by the community in RT 01, 02, 03 and 06 is to pay rubbish disposal fees every month. This levy is managed independently by the Karang Taruna group to pay the cleaning staff that every Wednesday night picks up trash. The amount of rubbish retribution is IDR 15,000 per household / month. The amount of this fee is for the cost of transporting waste from the house to the Leuwiliang landfill (TPA). IDR 5,000 for each five persons personnel cleaning and IDR 10,000 for fee of DLH (Environmental Service) officers.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>CONCLUSIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the results of the study, several conclusions can be drawn as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distribution of the generated waste in Cimande Village accumulates in almost every RT (neighborhood) and there are 20 illegal landfill garbage dumps. Local waste originating from the activities of local residents is a source of permanent waste generation, where the volume of waste is very large and relatively constant. The total population of Cimande Village is 6,800 people, so the assumption of the amount of waste generated by multiplying the assumption of waste generated by each person per day is 4,760 kg per day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waste management system in the Cimande Tourist Village in the form of providing the necessary facilities and infrastructure, including the number of cleaners who act as implements every day is not yet visible. The unavailability of TPS has resulted in the community dumping garbage in illegal dumpsites There is no role and local government in waste management efforts in the Cimande Village through Coaching on waste management. Karang Taruna as a community social organization in Cimande Village has just started to help with waste management strategies in the form of taking garbage from house to house in several RT (neighborhood), in RT 01, 02, 03 and 06. Waste</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">management activities began on June 15, 2020. The mechanism for collecting</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">garbage from house to house by assigning five persons personnel cleaning for each RT, which is carried out every Wednesday night. The waste that is taken is then collected into sacks and then carried by the cleaning staff to be collected by the designated roadside. On Wednesday morning, DLH (Environmental Service) officers will transport the garbage sacks and bring them to the Leuwiliang TPA (Final Disposal Site).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to optimize Sapta Pesona with waste management in the development of the Cimande Tourist Village, there is a strategy that is carried out. Coaching of the Sapta Pesona program is one way to provide knowledge to the community that the area they live in is a tourist area that tourists will visit if the area is safe, orderly, clean, cool, beautiful, friendly and memories. The results of coaching, community strongly agrees to be willing to implement the 3R (reduce-reuse-recycle) program, want to have their own trash cans, want to throw garbage in their own trash cans and want to do environmental cleanliness by mutual cooperation every month. The effect of coaching has a positively and significantly contributed to community interest in waste management at Cimande Tourist village</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>SUGGESTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Bogor Regency Regional Regulation No. 2 (2014) concerning Waste Management, namely in order to create a healthy and clean Bogor Regency from waste that tends to increase and the volume, type and things that can have a negative impact on health and environmental pollution, so it is necessary to carry out waste management. Local government (Urban Village Head) can impose strict sanctions in order to provide a deterrent effect and educate the community to raise more awareness about maintaining a clean environment and has to have a program to invite all Cimande community to do environmental cleanliness by mutual cooperation every month in order to optimize Cleanliness with waste management in the development of the Cimande Tourist Village to achieve Cimande Clean. Tourist Awareness Groups (Pokdarwis), Village Cadres and Youth Organization (Karang Taruna) have to reach out to people from door to door, making them realize the importance of cleanliness and segregation of waste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Local government (Urban Village) need to find new land and build TPS with permanent buildings to accommodate the waste generation in each RT (neighborhood unit) location. Because the temporary disposal sites were deemed unsuitable, a lot </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font2">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font3">of trash was scattered and gave off an unpleasant smell. There needs to be a plan to move (relocate) the temporary garbage dump to a TPS location with a permanent building. Treatment and volume of waste must be carefully calculated so that the existing infrastructure and facilities can function optimally</span></p>
