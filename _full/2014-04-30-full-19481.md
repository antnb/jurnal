<p><span class="font3">Quality English language texts on Indonesian urbanisation are few and far between, and those that address the consequences of postcolonialism for urban space are even rarer. Abidin Kusno’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Appearances of Memory</span><span class="font3"> is one such text. It has been some ten years on the making and has been well worth the wait. His first book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behind the Postcolonial </span><span class="font3">appeared in 2000, with the intention of examining ways ‘from which to view the emergence and development of the socio-cultural crisis in the postcolonial world, and the ways this crisis both shapes and is shaped by the practices of architecture and design’ (p10). Its singular contribution was to invert the overall thrust of many postcolonial studies, that is, through the lens of domination/resistance with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">emballage</span><span class="font3"> that this entails, and in the process to challenge historicist approaches to development studies. As a matter of choice, Kusno prefers to accept the cultural inheritance of architectural and urban space from colonialism as a gift to be transformed in the remaking and renaming of place by a new society. This view does not derogate history, and reduces the trauma in postcolonial societies seeking to construct a new identity. He suggests that the acceptance of colonial culture is both necessary and appropriate. Indeed, once we accept that the history of the world conflates to the history of colonization, then the concept of domination takes the place of the given rather than the exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appearances of Memory</span><span class="font3">, Kusno focuses, as the title denotes, on a series of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">aides-memoires</span><span class="font3"> that encapsulate a complex archaeology of memory – the archetypes of mnemonic experience for many Indonesians. Moving from his prior work subscribed by the influence of political cultures, he now moves to consciousness and experience, dredging the mnemonic for its material, symbolic and creative content and their role in interpreting and reconfiguring urban space. This may best be described in his own terms as ‘a new regime of seeing’ (p185). This is no mean task, and Kusno has incorporated six previously published chapters with three new to the book, stitching together prior work into a more complete document. In no way however does this reduce the value of the text, and many examples exist of similar strategies. While the book is organized to go back in time, with the more contemporary material towards the beginning, it could easily have been organized in reverse with no loss of meaning. So there is also a weak sequential relationship between the chapters, one of little consequence. The cement that holds the book together has nothing to do with the linear sequencing of the text, but of a series of ideas that deal with the persistence of memory as the history of the present represented in a kaleidoscope of different forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appearances of Memory</span><span class="font3"> is richly textured and challenging, it is erudite, scholarly, and an object lesson in style. It is a dense and captivating book. In reading it I was reminded in many ways of W. G. Sebald’s work, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Emigrants, Vertigo, and Austerlitz </span><span class="font3">but specifically of his opus magnum </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Rings of Saturn</span><span class="font3"> along with the revealing set of interviews he gave entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Emergence of Memory</span><span class="font3">. The haunting beauty of Sebald’s images are also recalled in Kusno’s choice of several illustrations, as in the painting of Sukarno in Surabaya St. Jakarta (Figure 47), an interrogation session during the Japanese Occupation (Figure 56), and the classical Parisian baroque gatehouse to a gated community in Jakarta (Figure 59). While it may push analogy too far to compare Kusno’s intentions to that of Sebald, one thing is undeniable. While the focus is indeed different, the effort is the same in both cases. It asks how we can possibly explain and accommodate history, with all of its contradictions, confusion, violence and manipulation, particularly when it is either erected in space (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Glodok on Our Minds</span><span class="font3"> ch.3) it or is conspicuously absent in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Back to the City</span><span class="font3"> (Chapter 4.) Closer to home, Kusno pays</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">homage to his mentor and friend Anthony King, whose </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Spaces of Global Cultures </span><span class="font3">preceded </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Appearances of Memory</span><span class="font3"> by six years. As is right, Kusno also generously acknowledges the influence of other world class scholars such as Benedict Anderson, Terry McGhee, Rudolf Mrazek, James Siegel and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The book has four main sections, – </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Governmentality, Remembering and Forgetting, Reminiscences</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mental Nebulae</span><span class="font3">. The initiated will appreciate the postmodern nature of the text, which represents an astounding pastiche of memories and reflections on the nature of urban space and its production. The thematic dimension includes collective memory, terror, postcolonialism, ethnicity, violence, trauma, nationalism, exploitation, resistance, displacement, poverty, globalisation and many other sedimentations. Content traverses nationalist urbanism, the Japanese occupation and Islam, to Art Deco architecture, busways, Garda (gateways), shopping centres and squatter housing. Relevant to this journal is the observation that Kusno never uses the term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">urban design.</span><span class="font3"> Yet this is indeed what the book is about. In fact it is of its essence. It distills many fundamental properties of urban design, and in the process of analysis, flays much development in the capital, Jakarta. At the same it offers us a panegyric on the existential content of the discipline, and delivers an object lesson to many architects (starting with Sert) who would reduce the scope of urban design to that of building projects. Kusno clearly demonstrates that the mnemonic is a core value of urban space and its construction, a place where time is interrogated and the persistence of memory reified, a dimension perhaps more significant to urban design than the narrow sectarian interests of development briefs</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As will now be apparent, I have studiously avoided the usual process of reviewing new books where each chapter is described sequentially in order to reveal the content. In </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Appearances of Memory</span><span class="font3">, we would learn little from doing this. Despite an overall historical regression in the material which adds a comforting linearity to the content, the text does not really progress in any significant direction beyond its own rhizomatic form. In this I recollect an interview with the French filmmaker Jean Luc Godard who was asked ‘your films do not appear to have a beginning, middle and an end?’ Godard’s response was ‘yes they do, but not in that order.’ Similarly, for Kusno, meaning does not surface ‘from what comes next’ but from the plethora of representations, contestations, visions, symbolic values and ideas, that infuse each section, albeit differently in each case. Discursive practices rule. In the process of recording, history is transformed by memory, it becomes fractured not only by the multitude of post-modern ‘voices’ but also by a vast array of images, places, histories, and events that have characterized the contested nature of urban space in today’s Indonesia. Without doubt a seminal contribution to the field.</span></p>
