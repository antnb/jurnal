<p><span class="font1">Bahasa adalah alat komunikasi yang digunakan oleh manusia normal untuk berkomunikasi satu sama lain untuk menyampaikan tujuan ketika mereka bertemu. Ada lima komponen utama dalam linguistik mikro yaitu, fonologi, morfologi, sintaksis, semantik,dan pragmatik. Dalam waktu yang cukup lama, seperti yang dikatakan oleh Yule (1996: 6) bahwa studi bahasa sangat dikuasai oleh kecenderungan untuk menjelaskan bahasa berdasarkan sistem formalnya, yaitu dengan menurunkan sistem yang terdapat dalam matematika dan logika, dan mengabaikan unsur pengguna bahasa. Pragmatik sebagai tataran linguistik mikro terbaru yang merupakan satu-satunya tataran yang turut memperhitungkan manusia sebagai pengguna bahasa. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eat, Pray, Love</span><span class="font1"> dipilih sebagai data utama dalam penulisan skripsi ini karena terdapat beberapa jenis deixis dalam novel ini yang harus dikaji lebih mendalam. Ada tiga buku yang dijadikan satu dalam novel ini. Buku pertama adalah tentang perjalanan Gilbert di Italia. Buku kedua adalah tentang perjalanan dia di India dan buku ketiga adalah tentang perjalanan terakhirnya di Indonesia. Semua cerita dalam ketiga buku tersebut merupakan cerita tentang kehidupan pribadinya yang berkaitan dengan perceraian dengan suaminya. Dan, di samping itu, novel ini juga sangat menarik karena menceritakan tentang kisah cinta penulis bersama seorang pria Bali Ketut Liyer.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of the study</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Language is a means of the communication used by normal human beings to communicate one to another to convey a purpose when they meet There are five main components of micro linguistics such as phonology, morphology, syntax, semantic and pragmatics; however pragmatics was more emphasized on the utterance of the context situation. According to Yule (1996:6) that for a long period in the study, there has been a very strong interest in formal system of analysis, often derived from mathematic and logic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eat, Pray, Love</span><span class="font1"> were chosen to be the main data in writing this under graduate thesis because they were assumed that there were many types of deixis in this novel that must be analyzed. There are three books united to be one in this book. The first book is about Gilbert’s traveling in Italy. The second book is about her travelling in India and the third book is about her last travelling in Indonesia. All of the stories in those books were related to her personal life related to her difficult divorce. And, in addition, this novel is also very interesting because it also tells about the writer’s story in Bali, especially the love story of the writer with a Balinese man called Ketut Liyer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The sources of the data in this study were taken from a novel entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eat, Pray, Love</span><span class="font1"> (2006) which consists of three novels and united to be one novel. This novel was written by Elizabeth Gilbert which was firstly published in the United States of America. This novel was chosen to be the data source because Gilbert narrated and expressed many things related to her own life what she had experienced in her real life through her traveling to Italy, India and Indonesia in this novel.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Collecting Data</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In collecting the data, documentation method was applied. The techniques applied in collecting the data, was firstly, reading the novel carefully in order to find out the sentences related to the kinds of deixis and their references. The next step, was their all of the deixis found were underlined and written down based on their types and categories.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Analyzing Data</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In analyzing data, the qualitative descriptive method was applied.

<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Person Deixis</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The distinction just described involves person deixis, with the speaker (‘I’) and the addressee (‘you’) mentioned. The simplicity of these forms disguises the complexity of their use. To learn this deictic expression, we have to discover that each person in a conversation shifts from being (‘I’) to being ‘(you’) constantly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Seen from the (3) data above, that the word their could be categorized as possessive pronoun of the third person.

<h1><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Deixis</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Time deixis concerned itself with the various times involved in and refered to in a speech event. There are two kinds of time deixis.Those types of deixis could be seen as below:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calendrical deixis</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1">Place deixis concerned to the encoding of spatial locations relative to the location of the participants in the speech event, and the analysis to novel as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the medieval Crusaders drove </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">east </span><span class="font1">for the holy wars, they witnessed worshippers praying with these Japa malas, admired the technique, and brought the idea home to Europe as rosary. (P.1, lines 11 - 14)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Seen from example (25-29) above there were place deixis found. There were : </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">East, There, Here</span><span class="font1">. The Place deixis concerned to the encoding of spatial locations relative to the location of the participants in the speech event. Place</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">deixis showed the readers the place where something or an event occurred because without knowing the places where an event happened would not give the readers complete information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Seen from the datum on the example (27) above, the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">there </span><span class="font1">contained an adverb of place which was used for demonstrating such place relatively distant to the speaker. Based on the sentences above, the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">there </span><span class="font1">was used to demonstrate a place called </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Ashram </span><span class="font1">in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Seen from the example on the datum (28) on the sentence above, the writer used place deictic marker in the form locative adverb </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">here</span><span class="font1">. It might represent such area where the speaker was present, which was catephorically related to some places in Bali. Therefore, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">here </span><span class="font1">refered to Bali.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>5.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discourse Deixis</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Discourse deixis concerned to the encoding of reference to portions of the unfolding discourse in which the utterance (which includes the text referring expression) is located, and the analysis to the novel as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">30.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These </span><span class="font1">fact alone make him an unlike romantic partner for me, given that I am a professional American woman in my mid-thirties, who just come through a failed marriage and a devastating, interminable divorce, followed immediately by a passionate love affair that ended in sickening heartbreak.(P. 7, lines 5 – 10)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept waiting to want to have a baby, but </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font1">didn’t happen. And I know what </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font1">feels like to want something, believe me.”(P. 11, lines 25 – 30)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font1">was a first for me. And since this is the first time I have introduced that loaded word – GOD - into my book, and since </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font1">is a word which will appear many time again throughout these. (P. 15, lines 1 – 3)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Seen from the example (30-34) of discourse deixis above, it could be showed that discourse deixis concerned to the encoding of reference to portions of the unfolding discourse in which the utterance which included the text referring expression located, and the analysis to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eat, Pray, Love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If seen from the example (30) on the sentence above, it could be</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">showed that the reference </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">these </span><span class="font1">that related to some facts. It showed that </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">these </span><span class="font1">refered to the same referent as some prior terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Oh, but there are so many reasons why this would be a terrible idea. To begin with, Giovanni is ten years younger than I am, and like most Italian guys in their twenties, he still lives with his mother.” (P.7, lines 2 – 5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the previous text quoted above could be seen that the reference </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">these </span><span class="font1">was used as reference of some statements known as reasons of Elizabeth for considering Giovanni. Therefore, it was called as discourse-deictic, which was used for referring the prior statement made by the sentence, not to the sentence, in this case, the reasons made by Elizabeth she herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the text above, it could be identified that the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font1">related to the statement in situation that the time of the word God was used in this writing by the writer, therefore, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font1">could be categorized as discourse-deictic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font1">, it was tied anaphorically to the word GOD, in which the explanation was mentioned after the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font1">itself. It was clearly to be anaphoric deictic that ultimately rests on the previous deictic notion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Seen the example (34) the data above the word that did not seem to be anaphoric, however it mostly seemed to be discourse could be seen as deictic in which </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font1">was used for referring the statement, not to the sentence of previous text known as such divine contract </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font1">had to be fulfilled by Elizabeth on his devotion in Ashram.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Social deixis concern the encoding of social distinctions that are relative to participant-roles, particularly aspects of the social relationship holding between speaker and addressee or speaker and some referent, and the analysisis to the novel as follows :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a teacher once ask that question during a particularly challenging Yoga class, back in New York. (P. 159, lines 21 – 22)</span></p></li>
<li>

(P. 170, lines 15 -17)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the text above, it could be identified that the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Ashram </span><span class="font1">was used to encoded the social identities of place of participant, in which this community had special role and extraordinary ways for living in the society by applying the philosophical values of religion, in this case, Hindu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Seen from the example (39) the data on the sentence above, they could be found that the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">residence </span><span class="font1">was categorized as ‘polite’ pronoun of the place for living.
