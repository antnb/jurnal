<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract*</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This research adopted conversational analysis to investigate the turn-taking strategies, how the strategies were applied, and the dominant strategy. The researchers used Jamie Miller’s interview with Zach Sang show as the data source. Observing the data source and typing the conversations were done to collect data. The collected data were further analyzed by using referential identity method and referential competence- in equalizing technique. All processes of this research were in accordance with the characteristics of descriptive qualitative research. The theory invented by Stenstrom (1994) was used to analyze data and Jefferson (2004)’s transcription symbols theory was implemented to transcribe the conversations. The results exposed that 78 utterances referred to turn-taking strategies and 11 strategies were employed. The data involved eight data of hesitant start and uptakes, seven data of clean start and uptakes, one data of alerts and giving up, nine data of filled pause and/or verbal fillers, 13 data of lexical repetition, 12 data of prompting, and three data of appealing. From the total data, lexical repetition was found as the dominant strategy. The participants mostly repeated the same lexical items to manage the conversation flow and avoid the speech gap.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The act of delivering utterances adds nothing essential when the communication is lack of attentiveness. As communication participants, a speaker and interlocutor are expected to be attentive in communication. Showing attentiveness truly not only will create effective communication, but also build good relationships. People communicate and sustain relationships with other parties through conversation (Liddicoat, 2022). Effective communication beyond a shadow of a doubt happens if both parties attempt to be attentive as their roles are shifted in an on-going conversation. The way that each party takes a turn while talking is turn-taking (Yule, 2017). Briefly, the turn-taking phenomenon appears when a speaker speaks at a certain time and has an interlocutor, who patiently waits for the interlocutor’s turn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Conversation flow is affected by turn-taking and the process determines communication effectiveness. The key to a successful conversation is to pay attention to when and how each party will take turns. Speaker and hearer need to take turn in order for a conversation to be successful (Ashidiq, 2021). Without turn-taking, there will be no two-way communication and successful communication is impossible to be achieved. In reality, an interlocutor generally does not fully pay attention and a speaker is frequently unable to arrange what to utter next. Stenstrom</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(1994) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emphasized that a hearer may fail to be as attentive, which results in a lack of encouragement, a hearer may interrupt without waiting for the turn that causes overlapping turns and interruptions, or the speaker may be out of words that further affects unexpected silence. It is common for these phenomena to occur in everyday life and the act of paying attention ensures the conversation flow.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Turn-taking is indeed a phenomenon that language users face every day. Turn-taking comes up for talking in conversations, ceremonies, debates, meetings, interviews, and other occasions (Sacks et al., 1974; Schegloff, 2000). This clarifies that turn-taking as frequent phenomenon that inevitably appears in conversation. As observed by present researchers, turn-taking phenomena existed in the YouTube video of “Camila Cabello and Jimmy guess song titles using only emojis.” In the video, Camila Cabello and Jimmy were playing a game of SongMojis where they had to guess the song name based on emojis shown. The turn-taking phenomenon is as below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Camila Cabello : “</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ɜ:h </span><span class="font3">(.) Airplane”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jimmy Fallon : “Oh, First Class↑, [First Class ((beeping))]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Camila Cabello : [First Class] ((clapping)).” (01:09-01:13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Fallon &amp;&nbsp;Miles, 2022)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The speaker named Camila took over the turn by explicitly mentioning the word. Based on the word produced, it shows that the speaker had not prepared before talking. The speaker felt hesitant about the correct title of the song and the photos shown by the crew were tricky as well. In starting the conversation, the speaker articulated the filled pause “ɜ:h .” in prolongation and continued to answer “airplane”. Despite the speaker's hesitation, the filled pause produced by the answer indicated that she had taken a turn. Stenstrom (1994) stated that for speaker that does not have any preparation before speaking, a filled pause (əm, ə:m) is possible to be found. In agreement with the analysis, it points out that filled pause was applied as the speaker’s way of taking turn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Turn-taking phenomena also appeared on Zach Sang show. The interview was specifically published on May 12</span><span class="font0"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="font3">, 2022 and entitled “Jamie Miller Talks Broken Memories, Here’s Your Perfect, Coming Out, Khloe Kardashian &amp;&nbsp;the Voice.&quot; Jamie Miller was interviewed by Zach Sang regarding the guest star's career. In the interview, there were a number of turn-taking strategies came up because it involved more than one participant that attempted to maintain the conversation flow. Following is one of the phenomena taken from the video.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach Sang : </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font3">əm (.) You know me because I’ve you know </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">we we </span><span class="font3">share friend”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie Miller : “=We do” (01:11-01:14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Sang, 2022)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach became the speaker and Jamie presented as the interlocutor. The conversation showed that the speaker talked to the interlocutor about having the same friend. Even though the speaker had earlier talked, the speaker still held his turn by continuing to talk. The speaker did not intend to give away the turn as the speaker still had other things to say. The speaker uttered the word &quot;we&quot; twice to hold the turn and make himself the speaker of the conversation. There was an intention to keep the conversation flowing through the production of the words. The speaker repeated the words to signal that the turn was still on the speaker and the interlocutor was not assigned to speak. In accordance with Stenstrom (1994), single words that come several times in an utterance refer to lexical repetition. This unveils that the lexical repetition strategy appears to hold the speaker’s turn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the abovementioned phenomena, turn-taking exist in daily communication. Turn-taking is examined in the conversational analysis due to its relation to a run of communication. Paltridge (2006) declared that conversational analysis explores how language</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">users manage and take turns in communication. Turn-taking is the process that includes a party talking at a time and a second speaker getting a turn (Sacks et al., 1974; Yule, 2017). In taking a turn, there are several ways used to indicate participants' intention to take turn. As admitted by Stenstrom (1994, p. 68), “Taking the turn, holding the turn, and yielding the turn employs a neat and tidy communication where a person speaker and another person waits for the turn to speak.&quot; Explanation and example for each strategy is as below.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the Turn, </span><span class="font3">the category that appears when a speaker takes over the turn. According to Stenstrom (1994), taking the turn is possibly to be tricky because the speaker may have not been ready to go ahead.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A. Starting Up, </span><span class="font3">instead of giving up, a speaker that has not prepared before taking turn can start the conversation with hesitant start and a clean start.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hesitant Start, </span><span class="font3">a speaker tends to produce stalling devices to avoid being seen as giving up, even though it needs more time to get words delivered. Stenstrom (1994) stated that for a speaker that does not have any preparation before speaking, a filled pause (əm, ə:m), which is a syllable that has a centralized vowel as nucleus an optional nasal coda and verbal filler (well, you know, I mean) are possible to be found. The production of filled pause is as follows. “</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Uhhm</span><span class="font3">..any..any..ideas for (0.4). Ok. Everybody must have idea uhh.. any other?” (Dewi et al., 2018)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean Start, t</span><span class="font3">his strategy signals the beginning in the unprepared condition by uttering “well” (Stenstrom, 1994). Besides, speaker is possible to use “you know” or “I mean” to take part while the speaker has not yet planned what to say. By announcing those introductory devices, the speaker desires to convey something and does not give the turn. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A realization of clean start is “You know, </span><span class="font3">we’re just coming out of this story about Las Vegas. And– while unfortunately it seems that – we as a nation are becoming more and more inured…” (Ashidiq, 2021)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking over, </span><span class="font3">it presents if the previous speaker has stopped talking and the speaker is assigned to take over the turn.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uptakes, </span><span class="font3">it is regarded as a turn taken over by a speaker to respond previous utterance. As argued by Stenstrom (1994), commonly utter “oh”, “no”, “ah”, “well”, and “yes” to signal uptakes as a speaker’s response. Furthermore, the word “oh” tends to signal emphasis and response to wh-questions and “well” refers shows indirectness, hesitation, and reservation to the answer for yes-no questions. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">An utterance of uptakes is “Yeah, </span><span class="font3">so whenever I come here, I’m always switching.” (Thainaphriao, 2022)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Links, </span><span class="font3">this is adopted when a speaker takes over the conversation by continuing the previous speaker's utterance. Stenstrom (1994) clarified that links strategy is realized by lexical items, namely conjuncts “so” and conjunctions “and”, “because”, and “but” to connect clauses and sentences. It infers that whenever a speaker takes over the turn by conveying conjuncts or conjunctions, the speaker has applied links. One of the utterances is “</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">But, </span><span class="font3">how I can tell you the information?” (Sinaga et al., 2021)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interrupting, </span><span class="font3">this comes up when a speaker attempts to get the turn without being given an opportunity.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alerts, </span><span class="font3">it is used by emphasizing a specific word at the beginning to attract another person’s attention. Higher pitch and louder sound are articulated to indicate alerts strategy realization. Stenstrom (1994) defined alerts strategy as produced by speaking louder and involving a higher pitch to grab another party's attention. This strategy is pronounced in the words “look”, “hey”, and “listen” in a separate tone with a falling tone. Interrupting is as stated in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“OH SIA </span><span class="font3">directed a film right” (Rivai, 2019)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meta-comments, </span><span class="font3">it refers to the strategy used to interrupt by giving polite utterances in a formal situation. Stenstrom (1994) claimed that meta-comments are polite devices that enable the hearer to come up with objection without presenting too straightforwardly and without making offense. The use of meta-comments is as seen in the following utterance. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Do you always videotape—</span><span class="font3">just were you always into dancing and just—“ (Agustianto &amp;&nbsp;Putera, 2020)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the turn, </span><span class="font3">it explores how a speaker carries on talking. Stenstrom (1994) expressed several reasons of a speaker to hold the turn are the planning at the beginning does not happen as expected, it is complicated to decide what to convey at the same time., and the speaker has another plan.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A. Stalling, it is </span><span class="font3">done by strategically placed silent pauses, filled pauses and/or verbal fillers, repetition, and a new start are the devices adopted to help take-over and breakdown avoidance.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled Pauses and/or Verbal fillers, </span><span class="font3">a Speaker has to ensure the filled pauses and/or verbal fillers duration. Stenstrom (1994) clarified that filled pauses and/or verbal fillers are employed to signal that the speaker does not intend to yield the turn, but is thinking what to produce next. German, French, and English have the words “um” and “uh” as the filled pauses (Rose, 2017). Filled pauses generally come with verbal fillers to imply hesitation. An utterance of filled pause is as seen in “The survey institution in Indonesia carried out a polling, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">eeee</span><span class="font3">, asking to the public, what was the result?” (Habibi et al., 2020)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent Pauses, </span><span class="font3">silent pauses are positioned in a syntactically and semantically strategic place where it shows the turn is still being held (Stenstrom, 1994). A speaker’s silence that is done after conjunction and an adverbial emphasizes more information will be delivered. The use of silent pause is as uttered in “Then, the third destination would be... </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(0.1) </span><span class="font3">where have I been… </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(0.1) </span><span class="font3">oh, I’ve been to Paris” (Thainaphriao, 2022)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lexical Repetition, </span><span class="font3">it indicates the use of a lexical item more than once. Stenstrom (1994) determined that lexical repetition can include single words that come several times in an utterance. Not only word, but repetition is also possible to be in clause partial or the combinations to ongoing the conversation. It is as realized in “ə:m </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I– I– I </span><span class="font3">realize that interest rates are not something that you often think about other than on a very broad scale…” (Ashidiq, 2021)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Start, </span><span class="font3">according to Stenstrom (1994), the best solution to avoid getting lost in conversation is using a new start. A new start is the only way to be done if a speaker that has not made up his mind exactly what to utter when the speaker starts objecting, has a difficult chance to put his feelings other holding the turn strategies. One of the examples is as conveyed in “But I feel SOMEHOW# . the sheer FACT# of not having to have . to have . this . really sort of - - it’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for one thing it does NARK me# that </span><span class="font3">. . .” (Stenstrom, 1994, p. 78)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yielding the Turn, </span><span class="font3">it is the turn is realized if a speaker gives away the turn to other parties to take a turn. It involves prompting, appealing, and giving up.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prompting, </span><span class="font3">it is giving a turn-taking opportunity to someone by questioning, greeting, or requesting. As believed by Stenstrom (1994), the strategy of prompting seeks to find responses by having the speaker to invite, apologize, object, greet, question, request, and offer. In other words, this strategy provides an utterance that is addressed to an interlocutor to be responded to. It is as delivered in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font3">A servant, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Henry </span><span class="font3">is this some kind of joke?” (Aisyah, 2021)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appealing, </span><span class="font3">it is adopted to get feedback by saying question tags, such as the word “right”, “all right”, “OK”, “you know”, or “you see.” Stenstrom (1994) defined appealing as the strategy that delivers an explicit signal to a listener indicating the speaker is welcome for feedback. Appealing sounds fairly weak when said by “you know” and quite strong when declared by “ok.” Besides, appealing sounds strongest when it comes after a silent pause. Appealing Is as found in “This book is called pretty fun and it’s about running a party </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">right” </span><span class="font3">(Rivai, 2019)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving Up, </span><span class="font3">it is realized whenever a speaker has nothing to utter. As Stenstrom (1994) acknowledged, giving up includes either a speaker believes that the speaker has no more to deliver or a speaker thinks it is the interlocutor's turn. When a speaker gives a pause at the end of an utterance, the next speaker will take the turn (Paltridge, 2006). A pause that comes up in the long duration infers stronger pressure on the interlocutor to speak.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font3">And they sort of hand it over to the police who dispose of it in the way they think fit</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">….(0.3)” </span><span class="font3">(Sinaga et al., 2021)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Turn-taking strategies topic has grabbed researchers’ attention. Two research conducted to explore language users’ ways of taking turns are as follows. Firstly, the investigation of turntaking strategies adopted in EFL classroom interaction was done by Amir and Jakob (2020). The conversations between two female and male teachers were collected as data. Stenstrom (1994)’s turn-taking strategies theory was used by the researchers. For the findings, the teachers were found to apply more strategies of taking turns compared to holding the turn and yielding the turn. The applied strategies specifically were starting up, taking over, prompting, interrupting, lexical repetition, and verbal filler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tyas and Pratama (2022) sought to reveal turn-taking strategies in the sixth episode of Boy William's podcast. The episode had Cinta Laura as the guest and both participants’ conversations were collected as data. Stenstrom (1994)’s theory was applied to theoretically reveal the strategies applied to take turn. The findings demonstrated that prompting, starting up, interrupting, appealing, lexical repetition, silent pause, filled pause, overlapping, and taking over. The most common strategy was prompting because the participants tended to lead another person to give responses to what the current speaker has conveyed. The appealing strategy came up with a question, offer, invite, and greet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Similar to the previous research, the present research dealt with turn-taking strategies analyzed by using Stenstrom (1994)’s theory. Both present and previous research took the same object and theory. However, none of the previous research selected Zach Sang show as the data source. The data source of this present research has not been analyzed by any other turn-taking research and it led the present researchers to examine it. There were also a lot of turn-taking phenomena presented in the interview and one conversation even showed more than one phenomena of turn-taking strategies. In a nutshell, the aim of this study was to discover the turntaking strategies, how the strategies were used, and the frequently performed strategy in Jamie Miller's interview with Zach Sang show.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Methodologically, this research referred to descriptive qualitative research. It belonged to the research design because the researchers descriptively analyzed phenomena that appear while language users are conversing. Researchers apply qualitative research to explore social phenomena, reveal meanings, and give detailed understanding (Leavy, 2017). This research took Zach Sang show in which Jamie Miller presented as a guest star. Zach Sang as the host, Dan as the co-host, and Jamie Miller’s conversations were collected as data. The researchers did observation and note-taking activity to get all turn-taking phenomena collected. Sudaryanto</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(2015)’s observational method and note-taking technique became the data collection method and technique. Several steps were done as follows. 1) The researchers watched the video and comprehended the discussed topic to ease the data collection process. 2) The video was rewatched after the researchers found the video was suitable to be taken as data source. 3) All conversations were transcribed by also adding the symbols based on Jefferson (2004)’s theory. 4) The conversations that included turn-taking phenomena were marked as bold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Referential identity method and referential competence- in equalizing technique were taken to analyze data. The researchers selected the method for this research because the analysis was done by identifying the relationship between language and a particular entity outside of the language that is being referred to. Analyzing data with applied theory was the reason of taking referential competence- in equalizing technique. In analyzing the data, several steps were followed. 1) The researchers revealed the distinction of each conversation that had been bolded. The distinctions were revealed by knowing the time and way of taking turn. 2) The data were equalized with the turn-taking strategies theory. 3) The result revealed the strategies and the prominent strategy employed in Jamie Miller’s interview with Zach Sang show</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Result and Discussions</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">As revealed by the result, there were 78 data of turn-taking strategies. The data were discovered in the conversations of Jamie Miller’s interview with Zach Sang Show. 11 out of 13 strategies were applied and the result demonstrated that the lexical repetition strategy appeared as the most used strategy. The most frequent strategy belonged to lexical repetition because the participants tended to produce the same words for more than one time to hold the turn. For metacomments and new start, those were absent from the data source. Following table summarizes the turn-taking strategies occurrence based on each strategy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">By adopting Stenstrom (1994)’s theory, the researchers analyzed the conversations that showed turn-taking phenomena. The conversations were transcribed by including transcription symbols based on Jefferson (2004). In displaying the discussion, the researchers reduced 78 to 11 data analysis, which represent each strategy. The data were reduced by implementing data reduction method as proposed by Sugiyono (2013). One data discussion is represented by one paragraph and categorization of turn-taking strategies appears at the end of each discussion. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">141 </span><span class="font3">discussions of turn-taking strategies in Jamie Miller’s interview with Zach Sang show are as below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First data was found in the minute of 00:38-00:51. The conversation production took place after Zach had informed to the interested viewers, who wanted to own a show. The man subsequently talked to Jamie as the guest star of Zach Sang show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach : “Okay, Jamie miller let’s go. Hello beautiful human! My name is Zach that’s Dana. &gt;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Welcome to the studio . Jamie Miller&lt;</span><span class="font3">”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie : “What’s up thanks for having me ↓ guys”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the beginning of the interview, Zach directly allowed Jamie to speak. The interlocutor named Jamie was given opportunity to speak without being protested. The speaker earlier introduced himself and the co-host to the interlocutor. Afterward, the interlocutor was greeted and welcomed by having the speaker to say “&gt;welcome to the studio . Jamie Miller&lt;..” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The greeting was declared by speeding the sounds compared to the surrounding talk. It was signalled by the symbol “&gt;word&lt;.” The marked utterance implies that the speaker yielded the turn and did not intend to hold the turn. </span><span class="font3">Additionally, the speaker also gave the turn because the speaker wanted to have the interlocutor’s response before interviewing him. As argued by Stenstrom (1994), the strategy of prompting seeks to find responses by having the speaker to invite, apologize, object, greet, question, request, and offer. Considering the speaker greeted the interlocutor and gave away the turn, there is the realization of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">prompting </span><span class="font3">in the speaker’s utterance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Apart from the data above, there is a phenomenon of turn-taking strategy as well. The conversation was presently started by Zach and Jamie involved as the interlocutor. The speaker recommended his viewers to listen to Broken Memories and appreciated the interlocutor for frequently watching the show. It specifically appeared in 00:57-00:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach : “I highly recommend↑ </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">YOU</span><span class="font3"> listen to you it’s called broken memories there’s link in the description below to listen to it… (0.1) əm . You just mentioned that you’ve watched a ton of this … (0.1) our show which is very flattering and very nice of you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie : </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“=Yeah”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach and Jamie’s turns were shifted because Jamie had gotten the turn to take over the turn. It is seen from the confirmation asked by Zach while previously speaking. This infers that Jamie appeared as the speaker and Zach was the interlocutor. In taking the turn, the speaker produced the word &quot;=Yeah&quot; to signal his response and evaluation of the utterance. The symbols &quot;=&quot; infers that there was no break or gap as the speaker directly responded the question. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It was specifically mentioned at the beginning of the speech in which the speaker gave a response to confirm his liking for the show</span><span class="font3">. Stenstrom (1994) believed that people commonly utter “oh”, “no”, “ah”, “well”, and “yes” to signal uptakes as a speaker’s response. In reference to the analysis, it highlights that the data has the same distinction as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">uptakes </span><span class="font3">because the speaker conveyed the word to take turn by responding to previous utterance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the minute of 01:11-01:20, Zach appreciated him after recommending his YouTube viewers to listen to Jamie’s new extended play.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach : “əm (.) You know me because I’ve you know we we share friend”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie : “=We do”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach : </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“And </span><span class="font3">you meet Dan for the first time. I’m so sorry”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie : “((laughing)) No it’s weird though because before were friends I was like a huge fan like to like”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach as the speaker conveyed the marked utterance to Jamie as the interlocutor. The interlocutor of this conversation previously had just stopped speaking. This caused the turn was taken over by</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the speaker to respond the previous utterance. In responding, the speaker linked the current utterance to the previous utterance through the use of lexical item. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The speaker said the conjunction &quot;And&quot; to link and lead the utterance to discuss the same thing. The speaker linked the utterance because the discussion was still about his friend</span><span class="font3">. Based on the context, there was Jamie's old friend that became the co-host of Zach Sang show. It shows the connection between the preceding and current utterance. Stenstrom (1994) clarified that links strategy is realized by lexical items, namely conjuncts “so” and conjunctions “and”, “because”, and “but” to connect clauses and sentences. The analysis proves that the speaker took the turn by employing </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">links </span><span class="font3">strategy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The next data was discovered during the minute of 05:08-05:17. In the meantime, Zach asked Jamie to answer The Voice or Khloe Kardarshian that changed his life better. The interviewee answered by saying Khloe was the person that could change his life, especially Jamie’s career.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach : “&gt;That’s crazy that you even get to say that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">right?&lt;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie : “=Yeah I mean… (0.1) the voice for me was like a stepping stone honestly if im being honest with you I was in a call center and I just wanted to leave the call center.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Through the conversation above, Zach as the speaker gave away the turn to Jamie as the interlocutor. The speaker yielded the turn of talking without providing protest as the speaker had earlier led the conversation. In other words, the speaker did not intend to take or hold the turn. The turn was given as the speaker sought to get feedback. The utterance of speaker mentioned that the speaker felt amazed by his answer. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">From the word &quot;right?'&quot;, there is a question tag and the word was conveyed to give a chance for the interlocutor to give feedback</span><span class="font3">. Stenstrom (1994) defined appealing as strategy that delivers explicit signal to a listener indicating the speaker is welcome for feedback. In addition, the symbol &quot;&gt;word&lt; came up because the speaker put high-speed sounds compared to the interlocutor's speed while talking. To sum up, the speaker yielded the turn by adopting an </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">appealing </span><span class="font3">strategy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following data appeared in the minute of 05:27-05:36. Jamie occasionally offered his help for fixing Zach’s problem with ipad or laptop. The interviewee told him that he could fix things because he was once worked at a call center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie &nbsp;&nbsp;: “No I was like legit like”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach &nbsp;&nbsp;: “You &lt;</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">know</span><span class="font3"> . how to fix things over?&gt;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie &nbsp;&nbsp;: “=</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I mean </span><span class="font3">if the screen tells me what to do, absolutely! ((laughing))”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach &nbsp;&nbsp;: “So you can read things from a screen to somebody on the phone?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The interviewee became the speaker that earlier declared that he could fix things. Zach as the interlocutor asked the confirmation regarding his ability. The conversation was further taken over by the speaker, even though he had not prepared to go ahead. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The speaker started the conversation by producing utterance to indicate that the speaker took the turn. The speaker said &quot;= I mean&quot; while he was in an unprepared situation and did not choose to give up</span><span class="font3">. The symbol &quot;=&quot; demonstrates the absence of a gap or break at the beginning of the speaker’s utterance. The speaker directly responded, even though the speaker did not have preparation while producing the first word. After saying the introductory device, the speaker told him that he could fix everything as long as the problems were notified on screen. As declared by Stenstrom (1994), clean start signals the beginning of turn in the unprepared condition by using “you know” or “I mean” if the speaker has not yet planned what to say. The speaker conveyed the word to show his participation while the speaker had not planned what to convey. The production of “I</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">143 </span><span class="font3">mean” as introductory device reveals that the speaker applied </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">clean start </span><span class="font3">to begin the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Before reaching the minute of 06:13-06:24, Zach earlier questioned Jamie’s ability to fix laptop and phone. Afterwards, Jamie told him that he could fix things by detecting the problems through screen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach &nbsp;&nbsp;: “… But but I mean you also get rejected from the X Factor”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie &nbsp;&nbsp;: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font3">↑</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL RIGHT</span><span class="font3">, Zach (.) chill me out I’m like this is pretty the voice like 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">years old Jamie no. I do I did yeah”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The speaker named Jamie took over the speaking turn and did not mean to take part as the interlocutor. In the conversation, the speaker was talking to Zach regarding his ability of fixing devices. After talking about the ability, the speaker was asked about the rejection he got from audition. Then, the speaker had not been fully prepared and was not given an opportunity. It led the speaker to interrupt to show that the speaker was taking the turn and expecting the interlocutor to refrain from taking this turn. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In interrupting, the speaker announced “↑ALL RIGHT” at the beginning of the utterance to grab the interlocutor’s attention. The speaker meant to inform him that he was okay to talk about the rejection</span><span class="font3">. In showing the interruption, the speaker produced the specific word in louder sound compared to the interlocutor, which was signaled by the symbol “↑”. High pitch was also articulated and it was noted with the capitalization. Stenstrom (1994) declared alerts strategy is produced with louder sound and a higher pitch to grab another party's attention. As determined by the analysis, it expresses that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">alerts </span><span class="font3">was employed to take turn to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following data was conveyed in the minute of 07:46-07:56. Jamie firstly mentioned that he did not mind to get a no from Simon Cowell, which caused him to be kicked off from the show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie : “Umm will I am was there↓ yeah uh Jennifer Hudson </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">əh </span><span class="font3">this guy called tom jones (.) he’s a he icon in the easy game and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">əh </span><span class="font3">this guy called Gavin Rossdale.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach : “Oh my god yeah of course”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie presented as the speaker, who was carrying on talking. The speaker talked about a guest judge named Jennifer Hudson. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In conversing with Zach, the speaker did not have good planning because he had talked before the articulation of “əh” took place</span><span class="font3">. This infers that the speaker had no enough time to arrange an utterance that absented from filled pause. It is due to the production of the preceding utterance. However, the articulation filled the gap or break in the conversation. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By filling the gap while taking turn, there is the indication of holding the turn. The speaker held the turn seeing that more utterances were needed to be delivered</span><span class="font3">. If the speaker did not articulate the filled pause, it indicates that there is an indication of giving up. Stenstrom (1994) determined that filled pauses and/or verbal fillers are employed to indicate that the speaker does not intend to yield the turn, but is thinking what to produce next. Relating to the analysis, it clarifies that the speaker applied </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">filled pause </span><span class="font3">to hold the turn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the minute of 08:50-09:01, there was the phenomenon of turn-taking. Jamie presently declared his wish to perform in his hometown and it would make him surrounded by many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie : “Yeah like but at the same time I felt that there was maybe a crowd I could connect to (.) &lt;making that kind of money but like do it on a bigger scale&gt;… </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(0.2) </span><span class="font3">but I don’t know yeah”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach : “I mean (.) that crazy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie presented as the speaker that carried on talking. The speaker talked to Zach by telling him about the interlocutor’s wish. In the conversation, it was shown that the speaker did not plan what to say in the utterance. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The speaker strategically placed silent pause between &quot;&lt;making that</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">kind of money but like do it on a bigger scale&gt;…&quot; and &quot;but I don't know yeah&quot;. The pause was marked with the symbol &quot;(0.2)&quot; as there was silence for two seconds</span><span class="font3">. The speaker indeed stopped talking for seconds, but it was not done to give the turn. It is considering the speaker still conveyed an utterance after the silence. Stenstrom (1994) stated that filled pauses and/or verbal fillers are employed to signal that the speaker does not intend to yield the turn, but is thinking what to produce next. Therefore, the speaker held the turn by having him to be silent for seconds and this infers there is a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">filled pause </span><span class="font3">strategy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The researchers found another phenomenon of turn-taking strategy as provided below. It was delivered in the minute of 11:14-11:22. Before delivering the conversation, Zach and James discussed Khloe Kardashian. James stated that he had given flowers to Khloe, but he had not met him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach : “Did she even get the flowers?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie : “I think so… (0.2) the teams said she did ((laughing))”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach : “((laughing)) wait (laughing))… </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(0.2)”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the speaker, Zach asked Jamie regarding the flowers given to Khloe. The speaker would like to know whether or not the flowers were taken. Afterwards, the interlocutor declared that Khloe’s teams told him that the woman took the flowers. The speaker laughed after knowing that the interlocutor felt doubtful about what he had said. The speaker asked him to wait as he wanted to continue to laugh. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In the utterance, there is the indication of yielding the turn, which could be clearly seen from the symbol “(0.2)”. The symbol shows that there is two-second pause done by the speaker at the end of utterance. In other words, the turn was given away to the interlocutor because he had no more to say</span><span class="font3">. Stenstrom (1994) mentioned that giving up includes either a speaker believes that the speaker has no more to deliver or a speaker thinks it is the interlocutor's turn. The analysis confirms that the speaker adopted the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">giving up </span><span class="font3">strategy as one of the yielding the turn strategies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Within the minute of 11:29-11:32, Zach and Jamie applied a way of taking turn. The conversation was explicated after Zach and Jamie had talked about Khloe Kardashian’s influence on Jamie's career. They also complimented the woman because she has changed Jamie's life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach : “She casually changes </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">your </span><span class="font3">(.) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">your </span><span class="font3">life with one post”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie : “=Yeah .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The conversation above featured Zach as the speaker and Jamie as the interlocutor. The turn was on the speaker considering the speaker was still producing utterance. Previously, the speaker had conveyed utterances, but the speaker had more to say. The speaker also found it was difficult for her to plan what to say at the same time. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In the marked utterance, the speaker repeated the word &quot;your&quot; twice, which specifically appeared between &quot;(.)&quot; as the brief pause or about one-second pause. The repetition was done to indicate the holding of turn because the speaker was still talking about Khloe, who could change Jamie’s life with one post</span><span class="font3">. Also, the speaker did not intend to give the opportunity for the interlocutor to take over the turn seeing that there was no long pause at the end of utterance. Stenstrom (1994) claimed that lexical repetition can include single words that come several times in an utterance. Based on the analysis, it highlights the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">lexical repetition </span><span class="font3">realization as the speaker’s strategy of holding turn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The last data is represented by the following conversation, which was clarified in 19:0319:20. Zach had asked Jamie's way of recording song in studio before uttering the conversation. The interviewer felt curious as most of the songs that he heard were found as meticulous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie : “ə</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">m… </span><span class="font3">I mean I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zach : &gt;Maybe that the point&lt; Jamie um no but at the same time &gt;&nbsp;I I just I don’t try&lt; to put too much pressure on it whenever I’m in the studio before I was working</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">with some any people doing like the songwriting songwriting Dayton in LA until last year I found ↓um… my executive producer who does all my stuff now his name is Kyle Shapiro.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jamie acted as the speaker while Zach became the interlocutor. The speaker took the turn without being prepared to go ahead in the conversation. This causes the speaker to take turn by starting up with stalling device. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In the speaker’s utterance, the speaker produced the lexical item “əm&quot; to indicate that he had started the conversation. The speaker refrained from being seen as give up, even though it would take time for him to arrange words. Instead of being silent, the speaker used articulation to avoid the turn being taken over</span><span class="font3">. The speaker indeed did not prepare as the speaker was attempting to arrange what to say while talking. Stenstrom (1994) clarified that for a speaker that does not have any preparation before speaking, a filled pause (əm, ə:m), which is a syllable that has a centralized vowel as nucleus an optional nasal coda is possible to be found. Based on the discussion, it points out the realization of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">hesitant start </span><span class="font3">in the speaker’s utterance.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>5. Conclusion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Referring to the result and discussion, this research concluded that there were many turntaking strategies phenomena in the data source. 11 strategies were applied by the three participants to maintain the flow of conversation. In the applied strategies, 78 data were found by applying Stenstrom (1994)’s theory. Those were parted into three major categories as follows. Firstly, taking the turn consisted of 31 data and from the total data, eight data belonged to hesitant start and uptakes, clean start and uptakes appeared in seven data, and one data was found in alerts. Secondly, holding the turn was adopted in 31 data as well. Filled pause and/or verbal fillers had nine data for each strategy and lexical repetition showed 13 data. Lastly, 16 data were revealed to appear in yielding the turn. Prompting got 12 data, appealing consisted of three data, and one data was discovered in giving up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Furthermore, lexical repetition became the commonly adopted strategy. It was frequently used until the end of the interview and all the participants were observed to apply lexical repetition. The participants applied this strategy quite a lot seeing that they had preferences to hold the turn by repeating the same lexical items. As for the least used strategies, those were alerts and giving up strategies because each strategy consisted of one data. Two strategies that the participants did not apply were meta-comments and new starts. The participants did not apply new start considering the participants talked about the relevant topic that was not suddenly shifted. In addition, meta-comments were not used because the participants were not in a formal situation. Thus, questions asked by all participants were not categorized as meta-comments due to the informal situations.</span></p>
