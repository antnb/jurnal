<p><span class="font2">This study aimed at finding out the translation procedures which were applied in the translation of English Medical Terms with reference to English Medical Book entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Clinical Biochemistry 4<sup>th</sup></span><span class="font2"> and its translation version in Indonesian entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Biokimia Klinis Edisi 4</span><span class="font2">. The analysis of translation the procedure was based on a theory proposed by Newmark (1988) by which eighteen procedures are mentioned. Moreover, this study applied a descriptive qualitative approach. In collecting data, this study applied an observation method by reading </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Clinical Biochemistry</span><span class="font2"> and its translation </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Biokimia Klinis</span><span class="font2"> comprehensively to collect the required data i.e. the medical terms and their translation. Furthermore, this study applied descriptive qualitative method in terms of analyzing data. The method was implemented by providing an explanation of the translation procedures. Moreover, the formal and informal methods were implemented in presenting the data. The formal method is indicated by the use of the table where the term and its translation were placed and differed into SL and TL. The informal method refers to the use of a descriptive explanation regarding the translation procedure. After the identification process, it was found some procedures were applied, i.e. transference, naturalization, literal, and descriptive equivalent. The dominant procedure applied was literal procedure. The contrary, descriptive equivalent was the least applied procedure. Based on the result, it can be confirmed that there was an attempt by translator in maintaining the SL words rather than considering TL words as the translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">academic discipline such as e.g. medical field, economic field, law field, is equipped with its own terms to represent the related information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the medical field, the use of terms is mainly to describe particular information, especially the notion of medical terms proposed by Fogelberg, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et. al</span><span class="font4">.,(2006) by which medical terms imply information related to disease, organ, condition, symptoms, etc. The terms in the medical field are known as medical terms. The existence of medical terms can be easily found in medical book. The medical book has been widely used by those who concern on. Therefore, medical book has been translated into many different languages by which translation takes the role as a bridge to translate the medical book from SL to various TL(s).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All aspects, including the medical terms, are all translated. Translating them must be taken into account since it is not an easy task to be carried out. Therefore, a translator must be equipped with plenty of knowledge especially in the medical field to transfer those terms into the target language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Moreover, during the process of translating, the translator must be faced with consideration whether the term should be translated literally or s/he must seek for another closest equivalent to preserve TL aspects. This will lead to the phenomenon of procedures in translation by which some procedures can be applied for the sake of accuracy, readability, and acceptability. There are many theorists and linguists have proposed the notion of translation procedures and their types. From various ideas regarding what translation procedure is, it is defined as a way undertaken by a translator to search for equivalents in the word or phrase level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In applying the translation procedure, the translator must be carefully selecting what procedure is about to be applied to translate the term. In other words, the choice of procedure will absolutely determine the translation. It can be illustrated by an example of the medical term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">theatre</span><span class="font4">. In this case, if the term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">theatre </span><span class="font4">is purely transferred, the translation will be ambiguous as it will confuse the readers towards the relation between a place to watch new movies and information about the medical field. Therefore, it can be confirmed that the procedure of transference is not worth to be applied to translate the term as it is commonly known as a place where new movies are shown. Translator may have another option by explaining the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">theatre </span><span class="font4">itself along with the context. In this case, the procedure of descriptive equivalent can be applied to represent </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">theatre </span><span class="font4">as ‘an operating room in the hospital’ or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ruang operasi</span><span class="font4"> in Indonesian. It can be stated that the choice of translation procedure can provide the various translation result. Therefore, the translator must be wise of considering it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As depicted in an example, the author found it interesting to find out procedures in translation through English medical terms and their translation into Indonesian. The data source were taken from an English medical book entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Clinical Biochemistry</span><span class="font4"> and its translation in Indonesian entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Biokimia Klinis</span><span class="font4">. Those two books were the primary data utilized in this study. In addition, this study applied a theory proposed by Newmark (1988) concerning translation procedures. There are eighteen translation procedures mentioned, as follows: literal translation, transference, naturalization, cultural equivalent, functional equivalent, descriptive equivalent, synonymy, through-translation, shifts or transpositions, modulation, recognized translation, translation label, compensation, componential analysis, reduction and expansion, paraphrase, couplets, and note, addition, glosses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The procedures in translation can be identified when the required data are collected. This study applied descriptive qualitative method along with library research, observation method, and descriptive qualitative method in analyzing data. The elaboration was discussed in the next section.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Research method is a plan of procedures, strategies, processes or techniques utilized in the collection of data or evidence for analysis to uncover new information or to create a better understanding of a topic in a research. It assists as a guidance for the writer to reach the aims of the raised problem in the research or study.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>2.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Approach</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">This study applied a descriptive qualitative approach. The approach must be involved in conducting a research. For instance, a qualitative approach is primarily exploratory research and text-based. The required data were collected by doing library research and observation since the data source was in the form of printed-out text or documents. The collected data in this study was then descriptively described and explained in descriptive sentences or paraphrases by using descriptive qualitative method. Furthermore, the use of formal and informal method were applied as data presentation.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>2.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Source</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">An English medical book entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Clinical Biochemistry (An Illustrated Colour Text) Fourth Edition</span><span class="font4"> was used as the first primary data. This book was reprinted in 2009 and written in 2008 by six writers i.e. Allan Gaw, Michael J, Robert A. Cowan, Denis St. J. O’Reilly, Michael J. Stewart, and James Shepherd. The translation book entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Biokimia Klinis (Teks Bergambar) Edisi 4</span><span class="font4"> was used as the second primary data. The translation was published by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Penerbit Buku Kedokteran EGC</span><span class="font4"> in 2011 and done by dr. Albertus Agung Mahode &amp;&nbsp;July Manurung, S.Si, Apt. The translation was also edited by dr. Novita Salim &amp;&nbsp;Nella Yesdelita. The English book and its translation in Indonesian were chosen as primary data for the data source in this present study. The author expects, these books can help the process of conducting this present study in terms of data collection to fulfil the required data.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>2.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Collecting Data</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">This study applied a qualitative approach. Therefore, in terms of collecting data, library research was done since the data source was in form a printed-out text or document. It was done by conducting an observation method. The observation method was done by reading comprehensively the English medical book to observe the terms and underlining them. At the same time, the translation of the terms were compared and underlined to assure that both are equivalent. Furthermore, doing a note-taking technique towards the English medical terms and their translation will help the process of analysis to become easier.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>2.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Analyzing Data</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">This study applied descriptive qualitative method. As proposed by Djajasudarma (1993:10), the use of this method is to describe the characteristic and correlations that occur among the phenomena in a systemic, factual, and accurate way. The technique of analyzing data was done in several stages. First, the collected medical terms and their translation were listed in parallel between SL and TL. From being listed, the process of identification translation procedure was easier. The theory proposed by Newmark (1988) was applied in the classification translation procedures towards the identified procedures in the data collection. The descriptive explanation was also added to discuss the applied procedure.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Presenting Analysis</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">This study applied both the formal and informal methods as the presentation of analysis. The formal method takes a role in tabulating numbers to exhibit a result in the form of figure concerning the occurrence of translation procedures. Meanwhile, the use of the informal method is in terms of description which is inevitable. The application of this method is through the use of words.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In this section, the collected data in the form of English medical terms and their translation are presented along with their classification in terms of procedures in translation. Some data were chosen to be presented as the data analysis in this section.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3.1. Transference</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The medical term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">meningitis </span><span class="font4">is classified as a disease. According to Dorland’s Medical Dictionary, it is defined as an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord membranes, typically caused by an infection. As seen in the table above, the medical term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">meningitis </span><span class="font4">was purely transferred into </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">meningitis</span><span class="font4"> in the TL. As purely borrowed, it can be seen that there is no spelling adjustment made in the translation. However, the pronunciation adjustment must be made as the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">meningitis</span><span class="font4"> is pronounced based on it is spelled. In the SL, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">meningitis </span><span class="font4">is pronounced as [mɛnɪnʤaɪtɪs], and in contrary pronounced as [məniŋitis] in the TL. From the pronunciation, it can be seen that there are some adjustments to vowels and consonants. The vowel [ɛ] is adapted as [ə]. Furthermore, the diphthong [aɪ] is simply pronounced as a single vowel [i]. Moreover, the consonant [nʤ] is adjusted as [ŋ] resulted from the letters ‘ng’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The different pronunciation occurs naturally since every language has a different system of pronunciation. It is therefore said that this term is absorbed purely with the adjustment of pronunciation based on PUPI. The decision of borrowing or doing direct transfer as the translation is not always the inappropriate way in translation, as long as it is well known and widely used in the TL. It can be therefore said that the translator applied the procedure of transference in translating the English medical term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">meningitis</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The medical term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">osteoporosis </span><span class="font4">is classified as a disease. According to Dorland’s Medical Dictionary, it is defined as the reduction of bone mineral density that causes a fracture. As seen in the table above, the term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">osteoporosis </span><span class="font4">is purely translated into </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">osteoporosis</span><span class="font4">. According to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kamus Kedokteran</span><span class="font4">, it is defined as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">pengurangan densitas mineral tulang yang menyebabkan fraktur</span><span class="font4">. In addition, KBBI defines it as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">keadaan tulang yang menjadi keropos dan lapuk</span><span class="font4">. Since the SL term is purely borrowed in the TL, the lexical meaning defined by dictionaries in the TL definitely share and refer to the same and equal information related to bone disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The borrowed term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">osteoporosis</span><span class="font4"> is differently pronounced as it is pronounced in the SL. Although the term is borrowed, the pronunciation still remains to be preserved based on the TL. In the SL, it is pronounced as [ɒstɪəʊpɔːrəʊsɪs]. Meanwhile, it is pronounced as [ɒsteopɒrɒsis]. It can be seen that the vowel [ɪ] in the first syllable [tɪəʊ] is simply pronounced as [e] in the TL. Secondly, the diphthongs [əʊ] are simply adjusted as [o] and [ɒ] in the TL. In addition, the vowel [ɔː] is simply pronounced as [ɒ] in the TL. The difference pronunciation has become the commonest thing as the word or term is borrowed from another language. This is in accordance with PUPI, where foreign terms must be absorbed in some classifications. In this case, the term is not adjusted in spelling yet the pronunciation. Therefore, although the term is borrowed, it does have the adjustment in terms of pronunciation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The medical term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">paralysis </span><span class="font4">can be categorized as a medical disorder. According to Dorland’s Medical Dictionary, it is defined as loss or impairment of motoric function in a part due to the lesion of the neural or muscular mechanism. As seen in the table above, the SL </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">paralysis </span><span class="font4">was transferred into </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">paralisis</span><span class="font4"> in the TL. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Paralisis</span><span class="font4"> was absorbed through adjustments that result as a borrowed term in the TL. The adjustments of pronunciation can be identified from how these two words are pronounced in their own language. The SL word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">paralysis </span><span class="font4">that is pronounced as [pərælɪsɪs]. Meanwhile, its translation </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">paralisis</span><span class="font4"> is simply pronounced as [paralisis]. The vowel [ə] is adjusted as [a]. In addition, the vowel [æ] is simply adjusted as [a]. Furthermore, the adjustment of spelling is seen in the translation. A simple adjustment of the replacement of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">y </span><span class="font4">becomes </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font4"> is already based on PUPI. Therefore, it can be said that the translation has followed the language system in the TL. From the adjustments made in the translation, it can be stated that the translator applied the procedure of naturalization to translate the English Medical Term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">paralysis </span><span class="font4">to be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">paralisis</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The medical term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">hypertension </span><span class="font4">can be considered as a medical condition that is related to blood pressure. According to Dorland’s Medical Dictionary, it is defined as high arterial blood pressure that is above 140/90. As seen in the table above, the medical term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">hypertension </span><span class="font4">was borrowed into </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hipertensi</span><span class="font4">. The translation is not significantly borrowed as the adjustment was made. The adjustment of spelling can be seen from the suffix </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">–ion </span><span class="font4">that is shifted into </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">–i</span><span class="font4">. The spelling adjustment is based on term absorption by PUPI. As the word is adapted in its spelling, it also affects the pronunciation since the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hipertensi</span><span class="font4"> is pronounced based on how it is spelled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The adjustment of pronunciation can be seen from the diphthong [ai] in the SL is treated as [i] in the TL. In addition, the spelling adjustment brings an adjustment of pronunciation where [ion] is simply pronounced as [i]. It is clearly seen that the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hipertensi</span><span class="font4"> is a borrowed word from </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">hypertension </span><span class="font4">yet the adjustments were made to fit the TL system. In this case, the procedure of transference did not take place, yet the procedure of naturalization was applied instead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The medical term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">coma </span><span class="font4">is categorized as a medical condition that is related to consciousness.

As seen in the table above, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">coma </span><span class="font4">was translated into </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">koma</span><span class="font4"> and there are adjustments made in the translation. The SL term consists of two syllables [kəʊ] [mə] as well as the TL that consists of two syllables [kɒ] [ma]. In the first syllable, the difference is clearly seen from the use of diphthong [əʊ] in the SL that is adjusted as [ɒ]. Moreover, the second syllable in the SL that consists of the vowel [ə] is simply adjusted into vowel [a] as it sounds in TL based on how it is spelled. In terms of spelling adjustment, the translation has been based on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">PUPI</span><span class="font4"> where </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">c </span><span class="font4">is placed before a, u, o must be shifted into </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">k</span><span class="font4"> that results </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">coma </span><span class="font4">into </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">koma</span><span class="font4">. The spelling adjustment is based on term absorption by PUPI. As the word is adapted in its spelling, it also affects the pronunciation since the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hipertensi</span><span class="font4"> is pronounced based on how it is spelled. The adjustment of pronunciation can be seen from the diphthong [ai] in the SL is treated as [i] in the TL.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The medical term </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fever </span><span class="font4">can be categorized as a condition and symptom of an underlying condition. It is one of the ways that human immune system attempts to combat an infection. The rise in body temperature helps the individual resolve an infection. According to Dorland Medical Dictionary, it is the elevation of body temperature above the normal (37°). As seen in the table above, the SL word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fever </span><span class="font4">was translated into </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">demam</span><span class="font4"> in the TL. In Indonesian, the literal meaning of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">demam</span><span class="font4"> is ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">meningkatnya suhu tubuh dan menandakan keberadaan penyakit atau kondisi lain di dalam tubuh</span><span class="font4">’ or the increase body temperature that indicates the presence of a disease or other condition in the body.

The literal meanings by which SL and TL share are equally the same. Therefore, it can be stated that the translator translated the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fever </span><span class="font4">into </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">demam</span><span class="font4"> by applying the procedure of literal where SL word is translated literally into the TL. The application of literal procedure cannot be denied, it can be an appropriate way as long as it can afford the SL word. This procedure is the basic way of translating since the translator is directly presented with the literal translation of the word where it is one-to-one equivalent.</span></p>

According to Dorland’s Medical Dictionary, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">haemorrhage </span><span class="font4">refers to the escape of blood from vessels. This differs from bleeding where the blood comes out from a certain part of the body due to the injured vessels, e.g. blood from injury and menstruation. Haemorrhage mainly occurs inside the body. As stated in Dorland’s Medical Dictionary, one significant example to refer </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">haemorrhage </span><span class="font4">is ‘cerebral haemorrhage’, where blood occurs within the brain tissue or ventricles that may cause a stroke to the patient.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There are many translation studies that have involved the research of translation procedures. The object such as figurative language in the form of figures of speech, cultural specific items are commonly researched for the application of translation procedures. The novelty of this study is, the attempt to research the application of translation procedures in the level of phrase through medical terms in which they are equipped with crucial, particular, and important information. Consequently, translating them requires a translator’s competence in considering the translation. Interestingly, this study revealed that the application of literal procedure that is considered as the basic way of translating</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:line-through;">,</span><span class="font4"> was dominantly applied compared to rest translation procedures. It can be stated that the application of literal translation cannot be denied to be applied in the level of translating medical terms into certain languages.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Newmark (1988) mentioned eighteen translation procedures. Through conducting this study, it was found four out of eighteen procedures applied in the translation of English medical terms found in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Clinical Biochemistry</span><span class="font4"> into Indonesian in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Biokimia Klinis</span><span class="font4">. Those four procedures are transference, naturalization, literal, and descriptive equivalent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Firstly, the application of literal procedure was dominantly found. The Application of it is inevitable in the process of translation. In this case, the procedure of literal was also applied to some medical terms. Translator cannot deny that literal translation may also provide the exact meaning as implied by the SL word. The use of literal procedure can be effective as long as it carries the SL word intended meaning along with the context. It, therefore, can be stated literal translation is the most common procedure applied and found in the translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Secondly, the use of naturalization was also identified for its use in translating the terms. This procedure is commonly found since there are many borrowed words in the TL where they have been adapted to the language system especially in terms of spelling and pronunciation adjustments. The adjustment is based on the term absorption stated in PUPI made by the Ministry of Education and Culture in Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thirdly, the transference procedure was found and applied to the translation in Indonesian. The direct transfer without spelling adjustment had been done due to either the unavailability of equivalent and the borrowed terms may have been commonly known and used by TL readers. It is therefore that translator applied transference procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fourth, the application of descriptive equivalent was the least applied procedure found in the translation of English medical terms. The translator must be faced with a dilemma in representing the SL word to be informatively accepted and accurate. As a result, s/he applied one of several possible procedures to be applied in transferring the meaning. In this case, the application of descriptive equivalent procedure was done by the translator. The definition of the word was brought as the translation in the form of short description to represent the SL word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the procedures applied, it can be concluded that there was an attempt done by the translator in translating the medical terms. The attempt of preserving SL aspects can be seen from the application of three procedures, i.e. transference, naturalization, and literal. The three procedures were dominantly applied compared to the descriptive equivalent procedure. According to the result, descriptive equivalent has been least applied as identified from the data. In this case, the translator attempted to represent the SL word through describing it in the TL. S/he tried to emphasize the TL rather than borrowing the term by providing an explanation. Moreover, the translation of English medical terms into Indonesian can be assumed to emphasize the SL rather than emphasizing the TL. This is due to the fact that most terms were purely borrowed and adjusted in terms of spelling and pronunciation.</span></p>
