<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Ikat weaving is one of the local commodities which became a source of income for the household or community, North Kodi, Southwest Sumba Regency, East Nusa Tenggara Province. In addition to ikat weaving craft, there are also other sources of farms as the main living of Southwest Sumba community, even the people of East Nusa Tenggara generally. The ikat weaving craft in Southwest Sumba Regency is one of the largest handicraft industries, which is 46.31 percent compared to other industries or 906 units from 1956 industrial units (Southwest Sumba Statistic in grade, 2015). Although its contribution to <sup>1</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Pendapatan Domestik Regional Bruto</span><span class="font3"> (PDRB) in 2005, is still low at 0.92 percent (one type of industry than all other industries in the manufacturing industry). However, for the district and provincial level, weaving industry is one of the most occupied employment land compared to other industries, and specifically for women (15 years to 70 years).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The empowerment of craftsmen will also support the family income due to the market opportunity of this product, quite promising although there has not been a valid record of the magnitude of demand for the woven product. The weakness of recording because many transactions that occur directly from craftsmen to buyers, at craftsmen home. But the fact is that traditional woven fabrics especially from Southwest Sumba, Become one of the products offered on a larger market scale such as in Bali and Jakarta in art shop as well as in exhibition as it has a market opportunity for international market. This is due to the traditional weaving market that has a uniqueness and originality. Hence, it attracts the collectors or foreign tourists than commercial products. In addition, what should be seen is a market segment or a potential demand coming from local communities, Government officials, or private employees, to tourists both domestic and abroad. From this description, the weaving work, especially ikat weaving will be one of the livings that can sustain the income or income of the family in the village. Attention to the business of handicraft weaving, through the intervention of empowerment programs, give influence in the dynamics of the craftsmen group and its members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The establishment of a group without its sustainability will not be useful. A group of weaving craftsmen in Kecamatan Kodi Utara has the potential to decrease poverty. Therefore, a program is needed to reorganize and strengthen existing groups. By studying the factors influencing the dynamics of traditional weaving craftsmen groups and the problem they look out on. Can be designed ways or programs to solve existing problems in the group of artisans. Previous research conducted by (Isnaini Rahmat, 2009) realize the role of facilitator in the empowerment program of traditional weaving community in the Mlese Cawas village Klaten regency the results of his research indicate that the facilitator plays an important role in realizing the improvement of human resources through traditional weaving. Different from, this study examines how the sustainability of government programs through P3DM in support of traditional weaving conservation in Southwest Sumba.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LITERATURE REVIEW</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The role of facilitator (named Gita Pertiwi) in the traditional weaving community empowerment program in Klaten by Isnaini Rahmat (2009).

<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESEARCH METHODS</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This research is a qualitative research with phenomenology approach. Phenomenology focus on a subjective experience or a phenomenological experience, study of a phenomenon that appears is actually a reflection of reality that does not stand alone because it seemed that an object that is filled with transcendental meaning. Phenomenology originates from the mindset of subjectivism that not only looks from a visible phenomenon but trying to find the meaning behind the phenomenon. Therefore to get the essence of truth, it must be able to think deeper beyond the apparent phenomenon to gain meaningfulness (Moleong, 2010).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This research uses phenomenology approach done in North Kodi Subdistrict of Southwest Sumba Regency of East Nusa Tenggara Province as one of the best weaving producing area in NTT. Data collection was done by conducting open-ended interviews with key informants; Make observations; as well as conducting documentation studies and records of archives relating to research. The informants chosen were informants who were judged to know the problem and informants had who knows a lot about the research. Data analysis technique is done by doing the interpretative analysis so that the researcher is able to understand a phenomenon better.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikat Weaving Craftsmen Group Characteristics</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The group of artisans is the formation of programs that enter the community, in 2014. Formed by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Penguatan dan Pengembangan Desa menuju Desa Mandiri</span><span class="font3"> Programs (P3DM). This program aims to generate productive economic enterprises through the assistance of venture capital in the form of yarn. Basically, the craftsmen in north Kodi are not only open to women, but the special who joined in this weaving group are women, formed in five groups. Obviously, the characteristics of the group can be seen in the following table.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Source: TPK Data, 2015</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on these observations, then in 2015 followed by the development of a group of craftsmen which accommodates the wishes of the combined five groups</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">above. The group's proposals, in two groups, were reduced to five for each group. More data on craftsmen groups that continue to be developed in 2015 are as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Source : TPK Data, 2015</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Program's existence for this village began in 2014. This shows the groups of ikat weavers have the potential to be developed through a group approach, through the help of threads, looms, and funds. The group of craftsmen is formed by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Penguatan dan Pengembangan Desa Menuju Desa Mandiri (P3DM)</span><span class="font3"> programs which funded by the regional fund (APBD) in 2014. The P3DM program is managed by an institution that is part of the government element. Since 2014, P3DM has rolled out funds for groups of ikat weavers in two groups. Group formation must be through group agreements, until the work process, and regular meetings arranged by each group. Based on discussions with the group, the existing problems can be solved by touching the elements already described for example on factors affecting group dynamics. These elements may be strengthened or constructed through appropriate activities, both on the side of craftsmanship, as well as on the side of stakeholder intervention. There is a problem that the group can solve itself in the community, for example through cooperation among artisans themselves, and so forth. In addition, some problems can be solved through external or stakeholder interventions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Low Group Feeling and Cooperation in Groups </span><span class="font3">The main problem in group dynamics, based on the identification of the aspect of strength in the group that</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">is the low level of group feeling and cooperation among the members in one group. This is evident from the group mood, and group cohesiveness that is still low in the less active group and the group is no longer active. On the other hand, there is the potential of group members in accordance with their abilities, so there are groups who continue their activities. It is, therefore, necessary to intervene to build initiatives for cooperation and group feelings in a way, activate regular meetings in groups, Guidance and more routine mentoring to know the aspirations of members. Outside interventions should pay close attention to appropriate approaches in drawing members' attention to groups. Guidance and strengthening must pay attention to local wisdom or elements in social capital, such as a network of natural cooperation in the community, namely </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">panjolurungu</span><span class="font3">. This potential is thought to be the basis for collecting and generating cooperation among members in groups as well as with other groups.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low Co-operation between Groups</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This is one of the important obstacles in handling, because it results in less compact craftsmen in determining the price, weak market information, to the limitations of market reach. Lack of cooperation resulted in the effort being made run individually and the problems faced cannot be solved sustainably. The problems faced will be easily overcome through the integration of members in their business. These weaknesses and strengths need to be linked in order to support and support each other, such as the transfer of skills and the sharing of market information on a regular basis. Therefore, it takes a media to bind cooperation among this group, that is the villagelevel craftsmen as a combination of existing groups. This group will serve as a forum to support the growth of handicraft business and community empowerment, especially craftsmen.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing Limitations</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This problem is generally faced by the existing groups, even by other craftsmen who are not or have not joined the group. What distinguishes is the network owned by each group. For an active group, limited marketing, Meaning that it requires broader marketing than the original situation where not just an intermediary buyer or a few direct buyers. Active groups already have a long-lasting marketing network. For the less active and less active groups, the marketing network is still very limited, compared to the active group. They can only sell to direct buyers and have no subscriptions yet. Not infrequently also constraints faced, is the price is getting less. For this problem, what can be done is to strengthen existing networks in active groups, through greater marketing for example through promotions and exhibitions. When there is a larger order of products, the less active and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">inactive group can be invited to work together to complete the order. For less active and inactive groups will be able to gain market opportunities or production</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low Motivation of Business</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This condition is particularly prominent in less active and inactive groups. Proximity to residence and kinship, not enough to affect the motivation of trying between them. Rare meetings in groups, and not interact in the case of handicrafts lead to lack of information and forget what the purpose of the formation of his own group. Lack of motivation characterized ethical behavior in the implementation, in addition to the rarity of activities involving group members or lack of togetherness, also because the market conditions are considered not conducive and less profitable for them. Each member has different domestic activities with each other, but the same interaction is when a certain public affair or more than one public affairs as indigenous affairs such as death and marriage customs. Relationships between nuclear families, in addition to the proximity of residence but who are related by blood, is usually in a stronger atmosphere because of the intensive meet, as inactive groups. Therefore, motivation to strive should be sought continuously, through regular meetings. Approaches from parties that can be trusted by artisans such as leaders and their families can build motivation. In addition, there needs to be continuous socialization from outside parties (stakeholders) to help their way of thinking, because of limited knowledge. Successful business picture elsewhere can be used as a comparative study to generate motivation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitations of New Weaving Skills and Techniques</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The skills in this craft include weaving, coloring, and designing. Skill limitation means one of the stages being mastered by craftsmen. This problem also affects the timeliness of the work process. For active groups, the skills they have tend to be more complete means that in every stage of production can be done by each member, so that dependence with energy from outside the group is very minimal. Besides that, this group is a family of craftsmen so that in every family there are workers who can help smooth the production process. For groups that are less active, and inactive, consist of members who have basic weaving skills only, while the design is still given on the services of others, so it greatly affects the time and cost used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This limitation is also suspected because the activities of group members are always different from each other, so the production process becomes delayed. Such knowledge can be disseminated continuously among members,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">especially at the design stage where the number of craftsmen is getting less. This can be done through training for group members, involving active groups to exchange skills. For groups less active and inactive, requiring additional skills to reduce the dependence of other people's energy, for example in terms of designing varied motives, and so forth. Different with the active group, more focus on the introduction of new techniques that can streamline the time, effort and cost. The new technique deals with how to produce fabrics or products with artificial coloring techniques without compromising quality, techniques produce fabrics that suit the market taste, and so on. This change can slowly affect the craftsmen, if they have received training and assistance more intensively. This is similar to what is desired by one of the stakeholders who have a desire to share new experiences and techniques for traditional craftsmen. Therefore, the need to involve them in training will be held.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lack of Knowledge About Capital Management</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The low level of education of craftsmen, and the lack of ability to meet basic needs resulted in the capital run out. This happens because the orientation of consumption is preferred, compared to the sustainability of the business. Knowledge of such important matters as how to prepare production costs on an ongoing basis is still limited, so the business does not go well. For the active group, it also faces the same obstacle that is the limitation of large capital management. They also realize that sometimes the cost of basic needs greatly affects the cost of business, thus affecting production levels. Likewise in the case of slow rolling refunds, caused by the gains are still minimal because the production has not been sold. Also, the assumption that aid is a grant (not to be returned) is enormous, not only to a group of craftsmen but on other types of business. Thus training on the management regarding aid or capital is very important for group members, for the production process to be sustainable. In addition to capital management training, it can also be followed by regular village-level meetings to share experiences in managing capital.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital limitations</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Capital is one of the most important supporters in business, as well as for craftsmen. The limitations of capital are greatly felt, by craftsmen, thus requiring assistance to produce sustainable production. Although on the other hand, sometimes capital is also misused by them, therefore need to adjust the amount of capital provided with the ability of the craftsmen.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) Potency</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the problems faced by craftsmen, there is potential that can support the implementation of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">program. There is a social capital activity that contains the value of cooperation between craftsmen namely gathering of energy and raw materials to make the process of production, especially labor. This can be called a networking or bonding relationship between craftsmen, so that it can be developed continuously through the group to be formed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a social capital activity that contains the value of cooperation between craftsmen namely gathering of energy and raw materials to make the process of production, especially labor. This can be called a networking or bonding relationship between craftsmen, so that it can be developed continuously through the group to be formed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The geographical condition of the village, located between two tourist destinations, in addition, market share or market segments of ikat weaving, covering local communities for indigenous needs, government officials or agencies, tourists, to collectors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Craftsmen have hope to continue to produce and develop their business. Skills possessed is a hereditary heritage, so it has become an important part of people's lives. The existence of natural resources (physical) for production capital such as the development of raw materials (natural dye plants). Weaving skills can also be done all the time, regardless of season, and can be done by both women and men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active groups have also been successful in fundraising or assistance, so it is worth continuing to develop towards more professional endeavors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are opportunities for empowerment programs to continue to help the productive economic enterprises.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support from village heads and community leaders to develop sustainable programs for the community.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Craftsmen and community response to the advanced program for the development of handicraft business is very positive.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the problem described, then the solution step should be adjusted to the potency and ability of craftsmen members. In the discussion, many opinions refers to efforts to strengthen and develop an existing business group, so that the program can be implemented for participating artisans. The process of preparing the program begins with a description of the condition of the group that has been formed. There is a specific problem in each group solved in a specific way in accordance with the potential that exists, and common problems must be addressed through outsider interventions, according to existing group conditions and patterns within the community. The programs that have been designed have been adapted to the problem, as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting Routine</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Reactivate regular meetings in groups and form regular meetings between groups to build togetherness and cooperation among members of</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">groups. In regular meetings, there should be developed a norm that binds each other to continue to meet each month, for example through family gatherings or gatherings that discuss the theme of joint ventures. It aims to build the spirit and feelings of group or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">keterakatan</span><span class="font3"> of each other, in conducting business activities. In addition, it can be tackled by way of production activities in different homes each month, which requires cooperation in the stages of the production process (processes that require more than one person), concept Social gathering specifically for work in ikat weaving. Socializing the importance of grouping through family approaches can be done through the husbands, parents and other role models. This is part of the effort to build a shared feeling within the group, so the joint activity also involves parents and husbands. In addition, it can maintain the stability of the relations within the group, and foster motivation for the fulfillment of common goals. While plans for the formation of new groups must pay attention to elements such as, the member's performances that include elements of proximity kinship relationship, the proximity of residence, organizational skills, as well as member strengthening factors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Establishment of Village Level Workers Group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This group consists of all groups of existing craftsmen. This will strengthen cooperation among craftsmen in carrying out their activities while addressing the problems they face. Group formation is marked by the completeness of the device or structure consisting of, chairman, secretary, and treasurer. In addition, to undertake technical functions, a section or section comprising promotional and marketing sections, training and mentoring sections, public relations sections, and financial or capital sections shall be established. The election of the board is done unanimously and will be chosen by all members of the craftsmen in the village. Responsible for this activity is headman with BPD because this group became part of the group under the village institution. This group is supported by the P3DM program in line with its aim to empower community groups (Pokmas), while the implementation of activities in the village is community empowerment institution (LPM).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Establishment of intergroup cooperation through groups of village-level craftsmen, is expected to unite the spirit of the artisans in trying to seriously and compactly face market competition. This group is a concrete step, which will play a role in performing various programs and activities in accordance with the problems faced by the group and its members by involving stakeholders from outside the community who are interested in handicraft business, such as government technical units, Dekranasda, intermediary buyers, and direct buyers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Promotion and Marketing</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The marketing problems faced by active groups, in contrast to the less active and less active groups. The group is experiencing market limitations but already has a subscription, while different from the other two types of groups that have no subscriptions or regular buyers. The solution requires a different way, since the potential of the active group is already present or greater than the other two groups. Regarding networking or skills to motivation, the active group becomes a model that can be further developed with the help of outside intervention. Steps that can be built for active groups are the strengthening of the networks they have and establish wider cooperation in order to support the growth of the business. Strategies done with outsiders are horizontal and vertical. Horizontally, i.e., with a direct buyer or intermediary buyer as a fixed subscription. Vertically with the formal institutions such as technical offices, Dekranasda (consisting of, TP.PKK, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dinas Perindustiran dan Perdagangan, Dinas Pariwisata, Bagian Ekonomi</span><span class="font3">), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Badan Pemberdayan Masyarakat</span><span class="font3">, and Private or Investor parties. Some of the things that will be done and agreed upon according to the role and function of stakeholders are as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attend promotion and exhibition at local and national level.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This will help groups already active in exhibiting their handicrafts at the local level and especially at the national level, as it has done in 2015. This activity will open the presence of investment, thus helping the development of network marketing group.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhibition</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Exhibition of community craft in the village, and can be used as one tourist destination. The geographical condition of the community that lies between two locations. Tourism destination will be strategic if made one of the centers of the craft, or be part of a series of tourist visits in the area. This requires the involvement of the Tourism Office as a promotional and information center for tourists in realizing this plan. The role of groups and village administrators is to prepare places, guides as well as various handicrafts that can support the interest of visitors. Guides are needed in this process because local craftsmen have no ability in more modern marketing techniques, and language skills.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contacting exhibition visitors at the national level</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">It aims to obtain a large quantity of product order. Opportunities ever obtained one of the craftsmen who follow the expo or exhibition in Jakarta, can be acted upon through an active container or group. The request of such visitors in the number of products that many can</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">coordinate through the cooperation of the government such as Dekranasda, etc.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain relationships with intermediary buyers and regular customers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This activity can be done through the improvement of product quality. It aims to reinforce pre-existing patterns so that the product market remains protected network.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joint Production</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">It aims to overcome market limitations specifically for less active and inactive groups. For both groups, the market share is limited when compared to the active group, so that programs and activities that can support the involvement of both groups are required. Shared production means, there are market opportunities owned by active groups, such as a lot of production orders, there is also an opportunity for other group members. Cooperation, in this case, can complete the order more timely, thus opening up market opportunities for craftsmen. Other than that, will grow trust from buyers to order products in large quantities.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Techniques and Training Skills</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Skills training will involve active groups, which aims to address the problem of skill limitations in less active and inactive groups. This concerns the skills possessed by members only at a certain stage, while other stages depend on other craftsmen. Normally, designing a motive is a bit difficult so that it can be socialized through activities like this. Basic skills training or skill transfer from an active group or an adept party within the community will help the problem. For groups that are still dependent on other personnel, can be transferred by an active group, or an advanced party, so that the socialization of skills becomes more comprehensive and helps the group's independence. New technical training for active groups, in order to produce products tailored to market demand, for example, a variation of the motif, yarn type, coloring type, model and so on by not reducing the quality of the product. This can involve shop owners who are also craftsmen who intend to share their skills with traditional craftsmen. Who is responsible for this activity is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dinas Perindustrian dan Perdagangan,</span><span class="font3"> let alone such activities have been done in other communities and will continue the same program for new groups.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training on Capital Management</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The low capability of capital management does not only occur in less active and inactive groups. Active groups also experience the same thing, especially for larger capital, because the level of basic needs is large, affect the use of capital. This is a very big influence, if not done the previous technical</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">assistance. The pattern of public consumption is strongly influenced by the desire to meet basic needs, or which is considered a basic requirement, so the effect on consumption and capital income. Capital management becomes a problem faced by the group, because of the wrong consumption pattern. Community consumption patterns in culture are sometimes the most difficult reasons to avoid. Customary demands become the necessities that will affect the management of group venture capital. It takes enlightenment and guidance on economic views and mindset, in this training. In addition to capital management, must build awareness to use the budget appropriately as needed, so as not to threaten the revolving congestion of capital. Therefore, capital management training is required, to improve the ability of craftsmen in managing their income. Knowledge of capital management is very important for the sustainability of activities, thus supporting the ability of the group in an installment of capital, until the production process. In addition to training, it is necessary to share or share experiences from active group members on the management of capital or technical assistance from village institutions in terms of capital management such as LPM for other group members.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance and Socialization</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The low motivation of trying in the artisans will affect productivity and threaten the sustainability of group businesses and individual businesses. Motivation to try is often dynamic, and more decreases, meaning that when faced with market constraints or production capital, craftsmen despair and become apathetic. The spirit of effort is needed, for the sustainability of business activities. The characteristics of artisans who on average only have elementary school education require a different and appropriate approach. Because of that, mentoring and socialization is very important for them, as well as modeling or modeling successful figures. Assistance can be done continuously or periodically, of the specified motivator. For a long period of time, the weakness of motivation in the artisans can also be done by comparing the efforts that exist outside the community, such as comparative studies on successful or fast-growing businesses. Such efforts can inspire artisans to continue their production activities.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(1)</span><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikat weaving as cultural identity of Southwest Sumba society is still maintained until today.

<p><span class="font2">(2)</span><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fdes the similarity of the problems facing all groups, while the specific program is for the different problems faced by each group. Problems faced by the group of artisans is the low cooperation between groups and between members in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">groups, low group feelings, market limitations, low motivation, the limitations of new skills and techniques, less able to manage capital, and limited business capital. Based on the problem, group strengthening, to support the group's business activities. Group strengthening programs include Meeting routine, the establishment of village level workers group, promotion and marketing, new techniques and training Skills, training on capital management, assistance, and socialization. This activity can take place through the cooperation of all stakeholders in support of the existence of a group of craftsmen, so as to achieve the goal of its formation, that is the empowerment especially of craftsmen and society in general. Achieving the empowerment of artisans will be seen through three things that are, Achieving sufficient income to meet basic necessities, development of the ability of craftsmen or the increasing ability of craftsmen, and have access to business and employment opportunities more widely.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3)</span><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors affecting the dynamics of the group of ikat weaving craftsmen are group cohesiveness, group atmosphere, group goal fulfillment, and group effectiveness. </span><span class="font0">T</span><span class="font3">hese four elements greatly influence the strength of the active group. A compact group is supported or based on a great sense of attachment among members, so it always aligns with group activities. The fulfillment of group goals is indicated by a) the fulfillment of members' needs, b) sustainable production activities, In terms of production and marketing, C) cooperation among members, in terms of work processes, skills, raw materials, to marketing. Group atmosphere is based on mutual trust, and mutual acceptance among members, So that cooperation, is established in the work process. The effectiveness of the group is supported by the achievement of aspects such as the fulfillment of group goals, member satisfaction, spirit and attitude of members, as well as productivity in terms of production and marketing processes so that the active groups are considered effective enough to be developed professionally. Atmosphere Group and group cohesiveness influences group feelings, motivation, and cooperation. These elements will be of great influence if associated with problems or weaknesses experienced by the group of craftsmen and how to strengthen the group of artisans. The low level of coaching experienced by each group indicates that the new group is limited to providing capital. Groups that are less active and inactive have deficiencies in each of the assessed elements. Therefore, factors that strengthen active groups can be important to develop for the empowerment of existing groups.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2">(4)</span><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strengthening program of traditional ikat weaving groups is divided according to the needs of each group. Programs generally include the uniformity of the problems facing all groups, While the specific program is for the different problems faced by each group.

<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>RECOMMENDATIONS</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(1)</span><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One step that can alleviate poverty Is strengthening the group of ikat weavers in the form of group coaching, mentoring, promotion and marketing, training, and business capital assistance. This is to optimize the community empowerment, and the development of handicraft business. The linkage of all stakeholders or stakeholders is the most fundamental thing for the achievement of the goal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(2)</span><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Central and Regional Governments, in providing programs to the villages or regions, Not done in the same direction, but requires readiness from the community, so it is not only administratively recorded but can operate in a planned manner. This can be done if community preparedness is done through more intensive socialization, and the involvement of parties with a unique and different approach according to the circumstances of society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(3)</span><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For local government and village government, incoming empowerment programs should be coordinated so that there is no overlapping program involving the same community. This will lead to the perception of aid as a grant so that the greater the dependence of the community.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(4)</span><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Coordination Team Dekranasda to Woven Craft Business (Dinas Perindustrian dan Perdagangan, Dinas Pariwisata, Bagian Ekonomi Setda Southwest Sumba District dan Dekranasda Southwest Sumba District) Activities that have been done not only rely on promotional activities, with considerable financing. The results obtained should be acted upon through Joint evaluation in a sustainable manner, so that the promotion function can have an influence on the craftsmen. The function of cooperation and network that has become the task of each unit can run if done through joint activities. In addition, the importance of recognizing the functions of other parties such as intermediary buyers, shop owners, and direct buyers. From these results, one of the responsibilities that can be played by Dekranasda is strengthening the group through cooperation between investors with craftsmen, followed by group coaching from the technical office (Badan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat, Dinas Perindustrian dan Perdagangan, dan Dinas Pariwisata), thus supporting </span><span class="font2">the sustainability of the development of handicraft business.</span></p></li></ul>
