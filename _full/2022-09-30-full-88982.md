<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Tourism has become one of the sectors that directly got effect from the pandemic of COVID 19. Considering the significant slope of visitor to Indonesia, this has made the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy takes a decision on changing the business model. From Traditional Tourism Management to Digital Tourism Management which has an opportunity for maintaining, also recovering tourism sector in Indonesia (Renstra, 2021).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Moreover, in the long-term planning, Indonesia will develop these 5 super priority destinations, not only designed to be attractive to the tourist, but also developing the creative economic ecosystem that will involve the local people. These 5 super priority destinations are Lake Toba from North Sumatera. This infamous lake is known as the biggest volcanic lake in the world, in the second spot there is Borobudur Temple from Central Java. This temple is a sole tourism object that has the most visitors. For the third spot is Man-dalika from West Nusa Tenggara, this destination has become the host of class world MotoGP event, for forth spot there is La-buan Bajo from East Nusa Tenggara. Beside the eyes pleasing scenery, Labuan Bajo has the Comodo Island as the only original habitat in the world. The last destination is Likupan from North Sulawesi. Likupang offers marine tourism with beaches and beautiful yet magnificent undersea scenery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">COVID 19 pandemic has directly giving a very huge demand to the leaders. Therefore, all countries and their governments have to have various policies or strategies that competent to overcome the effect from COVID 19 pandemic, and of course this policy or strategy is enforced and customized with the developing condition. (Purwanto, E. A., Kumorotomo, W., Widaningrum, A., Mas' udi, W., &amp;&nbsp;Astrina,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A. R., 2020). The former Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy, Wishnutama Kusubandio, in his term explain about the strategy of 5 Super Priority Destination, which for the physical development will be postponed because of some obstacles, but for infrastructure related to the connectivity, airport still has to be running according to the plan that has been done and team up with PUPR Ministry and Ministry of Transportation (Kemenparekraf, 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Beside that, Wishnutama also explaining that COVID 19 pandemic also can be used with rearrange Indonesian’s future tourism plan. This recovery will paying attention to 3A developing aspect (Attractions, Accessibility and Amenities) in 5 Super Priority Destinations. Still, Wishnu-tama also emphasize on increasing the 2P that are Promotion and Participation of the entrepreneur. On the other side, sto-rynomich tourism approach that put forward the narration will be used, creative content, living culture and the power of culture, also utilise KPBU scheme in constructing the entertainment centers, such as theme park that can absorb a lot of tourist. According to Wishnu tourism development is not only just building the infrastructure or making an event. There is also an important matter that is increasing interpretation toward a place or tourism destination. Packing the Indonesian tourism into a story become an important thing on planning to develop the tourism sector, especially on 5 Super Priority Tourism Destinations (inews.id, 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On December 23rd, 2020, there was a change in Indonesian’s government cabinet. The next Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy is Sandiaga Uno, he explain that the development of 5 Super Priority Destinations is a direct order from President Jokowi. Sandiaga has strategy on 5 Super Priority Destinations this will be developed not only in building the infrastructure but also from the side of creative economy. Furthermore, explained that this </span><span class="font1">e-ISSN 2407-392X. p-ISSN 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">focus is expected to get quality from tourist visit, either domestic or international, so they can stay longer in Indonesia. Thinking that the tourist usually spends the vacation budget to buy creative products from the region they visit. If it’s well packed, the creative entrepreneur certainly will get a positive impact (kemenparekraf.com, 2021).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Start from infrastructure, the communication network quality, product of creative economy to preparing the superior human resource. Because this is super priority, so the interconnection from infrastructure side has to be done seriously. Like airports, ports, roads, all of them have to have world class quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Ministry also considering the aspect of communication network in the super priority destinations. According to him, seeing the trend that tourist always want to be up to date in their media social, so telecommunication aspect is important in 5 Super Priority Destinations (ke-menparekraf.com, 2021).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Also do not forget to develop the creative product in the super priority destination. One of which the focus is the culinary from the destination. As we know, culinary from every destination always become the charm for tourist. Like culinary from other destinations that very attached, like gudeg from Yogjakarta, nasi liwet from Solo or rawon from Surabaya. Also don’t forget that has to be prepare is the human resource quality that will welcome the tourist in the super priority destination. For example, Minister Sandiaga said that Bali has the best hospitality in the world (ke-menparekraf.com, 2021).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To preparing tourism in the New Normal era, the Ministry also encourage quality tourism that taken with increasing the tourism quality also the comfort and security from each tourism destination. So, the Ministry adjust the Clean, Health, Safety and Environment (CHSE) certification to all tourism entrepreneurs. The </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">CHSE certification becomes an important thing where there is a pandemic, will change the community’s habit on traveling. Also, comfort, security and cleanliness will be considered for overseas or domestic tourists to do the traveling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not only up to the application of CHSE certification on this digitalization ear, this is the perfect time for transforming the tourism ecosystem with using digital technology as much as possible. The high number of social media users in the world or in Indonesia, by it’s nature to allow two ways communication, sharing contents and information, also the wide range making social media as one of the most ideal media to promote the tourism industry, especially for the Ministry. Through social media, Ministry can do promotion/marketing campaign, spreading information related with a product, tourism event and tourism destination to the future tourist effectively and efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the interesting innovation for supporting Indonesian tourism in the middle of COVID 19 pandemic is through Virtual Tour. Reckoning our tourism sector is undergoing a decreasing, the utilization of digital platform can be uses to support the continuity of our tourism. In short, Virtual Tour is one of a new concept for vacationing in the middle of the pandemic. We can explore some interesting tourism destination in Indonesia with only internet connection and gadget from home. Virtual Tour can be in a form of pictures, videos with other multimedia element like sound effect, narration and also texts. (Muhammad, R., Mutiarin, D., &amp;&nbsp;Damanik, J., 2021)</span></p>

Besides that, the sectors that directly connected with tourism will be affected by Covid 19 pandemic, like processing industry, transportation, accommodation providers also large scale merchants and also retails (Pambudi et al., 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are a lot of research that has been conducted about the international tourism policy, but only small number of research that is done on how the adaptation of economy policy in a country can affected to the tourism (Kim et al., 2018). Reviewing the growth economic plan does not mean change the whole planning, but adding part according with the current condition with the more flexible (Lew, 2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The positive side from Covid-19 pandemic is tourism destination management can start to innovate with increasing the service quality and the environment quality in creating the sustainable tourism growth (Gössling et al., 2020). The effort on destination tourism management in giving online service on the adaptation of new habits is an opportunity form on creating smart tourism destination (Novianti &amp;&nbsp;Wulung, 2020).</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Government Policy</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The decrease of visit from overseas tourists effect on foreign exchange income from tourism. Indonesian government has assign policy package to accelerate the tourism sector performance also to attract tourist visit in the middle of Covid 19 pandemic, that is to allocate additional national budget to the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy in the amount of 298.5 billion rupiah, giving insentive for airlines, travel agents on joint promotion scheme for tourism promotion, familiarization trip and influencer.

On the other hand, some efforts has been done to attract MICE potential and international events to be held in Indonesia (Sugihamertha, 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The destination’s image as a save place and secure, where tourist will feel better (Van et al., 2020). Indonesian government has established new normal transition period in early June, 2020 (Anies, dalam Setyawan 2020). Government uses this opportunity to build up interest and awaken positive emotion towards the tourism product. Covid 19 has given information of uncertainty and constant changing so the needs of new information had become important. What it means that the information is not only from quality but also from the quantity (Falcone &amp;&nbsp;Sapi-enza, 2020). The government policy that has been changed because of Covid 19 needs to be inform immediately to the public and stakeholders. The information can give sense of secure to the public in term of the protection from Covid 19 as well as how to minimalized the spread of the virus (Gorfinkel et al., 2020) and might make the condition is easier to predict (Falcone &amp;&nbsp;Sapienza, 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Social media gives a good and effective chance to the public sector on promoting the policy and activities that are being done, other than that, also to sending message to interact with the public (Hancu-Budui et al., 2020). Social media is information tool that facilitated the authority to share information in real-time (Bonsón et al., 2019). This has been one of tourism destination promotion policy that is effective and efficient to be used in the Covid 19 situation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">As one of the social media platform, certainly YouTube has its own characteristic, for YouTube, there are some characteristics that will make the users feel comfortable when using it, that are, first there is no duration limit on the video when users want to upload their videos. This thing has become YouTube’s supremacy from other platforms.

The next approach to content analysed which is in between lowered model pure empirically and pure theoretically is a model that known as code that emerged. This approach is lowered from quantitative research concept grounded theory (Glase &amp;&nbsp;Strauss, 1967). So this analysis is about making valid conclusion, can be replicate and has objective message based on explicit rules. The content of analysis can be daily notes, newspaper articles, story, radio message, television, documents, textes or symbols (Prasad, B. D., 2008).</span></p>
