<p><span class="font4">Mangrove ecosystems are crucial for the management of some coastal resources in Indonesia. Their function in providing the linkage between the land and the sea, make them act as the filter in reducing the damaging effects of major environmental changes, and as a sources of nourishment for both aquatic and terrestrial animals (Bengen, 2001)</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1970 mangrove forest in Benoa Bay was still not degraded yet in total area of 1,373.5 ha. Exploitation outside the area of mangrove forest in Benoa Bay has been recently extended with total area 319.285 ha, for example exploitation of the pledging area so that forest habitat of mangrove at that time dwindle to become 1,054.142 ha from totally area 1,373.50 ha (Dinas Kehutanan Province Bali, 2004). Availability of the data had not yet been enough for more information about the growth of landscape area. This matter caused by the limitation of fund for the activity of monitoring and survey of area. For this reason, remote sensing is an attractive means of obtaining data for defining deforested areas and updating management plans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This research takes location in Benoa Bay and used Landsat TM in 1994, Landsat ETM + in 2002 with the purpose to know mangrove area change for eight years time, mangrove density and about the accuracy of Landsat TM and ETM+ data for mangrove monitoring area in Benoa Bay.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">Mangrove area data were taken from satellite image through an image interpretation process using supervised classification method. Classification conducted was in accordance to pixel value to determine training area. This matter is enabled because of the available information or data about mangrove area in Benoa Bay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The steps to detect mangrove object were conducted with making of composite image of false color using some different bands. The steps for identifying mangrove area were conducted with determination of mangrove area. The result of identified areas above was used to classify the pixel automatically according to its value at swampy forest to yield a thematic map of mangrove area and mangrove density in Benoa Bay.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Single Plot Method is a method used for making an inventory of vegetation using one training plot to represent one type of vegetation (Sundra, 2001). This method is suitable for areas/forests which are physiognomic the same. Principally, this method is used to determine the extent of an area that is needed in the same physiognomy. The final evaluation was statistically analyzed by calculating an appropriate percentage (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">% correct)</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(% commission error)</span><span class="font4"> by pixel count.

<h1><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>DISCUSSION</span></h1>
<h1><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Mangrove Area and Mangrove Density Mangrove Areas in 1994 and 2002</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the results of digital analysis, the map of the extent of mangrove areas in 1994 had smaller area compared with the extent of mangrove</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">areas in the image of 2002. The extent of mangrove areas in the image of 1994 was 447.69 ha (Figure 3.1.), but the extent in 2002 was 622.08 ha (Figure 3.2.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Asthana (2005) the degradation of mangrove areas was due to various causes that had been begun since 1974, when the handling of reforestation was done by private companies but resulted nothing. Violations such as land-functional changes were getting more frequently to happen since 1986, so that the government soon carried out the reforestation at least 100 Ha annually, and had been done for 3 years, i.e.: in 1990, 1991 and in 1993.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This research obtained that the extent of mangrove areas in 1994 was smaller than that in 2002. This matter probably happened because in 1994 during the time of reforestation of mangrove areas which was just started so that there were still some seashore ponds existed and some blank spots that were not reforested yet, but the increasing extent of mangrove areas in 2002 was caused by the performing of conservation and rehabilitation which means that the conserving activity is to rehabilitate or reforest in order to make mangrove areas as an ecosystem which has an important function to support various aspects of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Visual interpretation of image 1994 (Figure 3.1.) shows that the reforestation result of the year before, spreads out evenly along Benoa Bay but its extent is still small, but in 2002 (Figure 3.2.) it</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">shown that the mangrove areas spread unevenly and much increase than that in 1994.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The increasing extent of mangrove areas, as visual appearance of the image of Landsat ETM+ 2002 (Figure 3.2) shows that extent of vegetation of mangrove tends to direct to the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Mangrove Density in 1994 and 2002</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From image analysis using maximum likelihood method, the mangrove was classified into 3 classes i.e.: mangroves with high density, medium density and low density. By applying Algorithm (Nuarsa et.al., 2005) through analysis of map calculation, the classification result was overlaid and obtained the area of each density (high, medium and low).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the ground check, used single plot method by using 6 trees so that it was obtained specific area that represents 1 point of area and took 10 points for each density. The purpose of the ground check was to know the number of the trees from each density of the high, medium and low densities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the density of mangrove areas through image of Landsat 1994, it was obtained that the high density was 225.15 ha, the medium density was 122.48 ha, and the low density was 130.05 ha (Table 3.1, Figures 3.3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the mangrove density using the image of Landsat ETM+ 2002, it was obtained that the area of high density was 225.15 ha., the area of medium</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">density was 122.48 ha and for low density was 130.05 ha (Table 3.2., Figures 3.4.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the high density obtained the highest number of trees, that was 524 trees/ha with the area of 114.6 m². According to Asthana (2005), this matter was caused by seashore physiographic, that is, the more flat the seashore and the higher the tides, the wider the area of grown mangrove is. Seashore topographic condition is an important factor which affects the characteristics of the mangrove structure, especially species composition, species dissemination and the measure and extent of mangrove areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the extent of mangrove areas using the Image of Landsat ETM+ 2002, it was obtained that the extent of mangrove areas was higher than the one obtained by using the Image of Landsat TM 1994. This matter affected the density of mangrove area itself, where the growth of the mangrove areas was relatively quickly and well, would cause mangrove plants one with the others being dense day after day so that the high density would be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For medium density resulted in the highest number of trees that was 489 trees/ha with the area of 204.48 m². The reforestation activity which was done more intensively by the society and the government affected the growth of mangrove plants and led to obtain the higher density. The success of the rehabilitation upon the former shore fishponds by planting them with mangrove plants which was done in every occasion, gave more and more chance to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">better growth of the extent and density of mangrove areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the low density, the highest number of trees obtained was 317 trees/Ha with the basal area of 0.94 ha. According to Ardhana (2003), the density is a number of individual plants in an area at a specific time. The obtained mangrove density higher, and then the environment and organisms that lived in those mangrove areas would live well, because mangrove vegetation gave source of life for the organisms.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Regression and Corelation Analysis of Mangrove Density</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">In this research, the regression was done between the total of mangrove areas and the value of mangrove interpretation. Its purpose was to know whether there was a relationship between the variables and how high was the correlation coefficient. For the mangrove density was the determination coefficient (r<sup>2</sup>) was 0.6312 (Figure 3.5). In Figure 3.6., there is mangrove density and a tool bar where there are number intervals. Red means mangrove with high density which total of mangrove was 364.723 tree/ha – 466.311 tree/ha, spreads in marginal area, green means mangrove with medium density which total of mangrove was 237.738 tree/ha – 288.532 tree/ha, and blue means mangrove with low density which total of mangrove was 186.944 tree/ha – 237.738 tree/ha.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Result of regression analysis of mangrove density with r<sup>2</sup> in 2002 used in interpretation of mangrove density in 1994 can be showed at Figure 3.7. Figure 3.7. shows that total mangrove per hectar with high density (red color) between the value of 357.10 tree/ha –316.47 tree/ha, for the mangrove with medium density (green color) with the value of 273.29 tree/ha – 316.47 tree/ha, and for the mangrove with low density with the value of between 252.98 tree/ha –273.29 tree/ha.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Coefficient correlation is statistical instrument that can be used for comparing the measurement of two different variables in order to determine the correlation between those variables (Arikunto,1997).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Figure 3.5. it is shown that dots formed a diagonal line which means that there is a high postive correlatied between two variables.The determination coefficients (r<sup>2</sup>) for mangrove density are above 0.6312, which means that there is enough correlation. Total of mangrove between image interpretation ( Figure 3.10) with ground check is different as shown from determination coefficient (r<sup>2</sup>) of 63.12 % and to 47.08% there is mistake was caused by image interpretation results using Landsat 2002, whereas the ground check observation was done in 2006. This matter shows the weakness of the correlation obtained was categorized as sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Accuracy Assessment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The assessment of overall accuracy that could be reached in the classification of mangrove areas was 90 %. These values were above the acceptable limit of accuracy stated by Nuarsa et.al (2005) that was 80 %, so that this classification accuracy was acceptable.</span></p>
