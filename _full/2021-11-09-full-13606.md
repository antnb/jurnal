<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ABSTRACT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A simple and efficient </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font6"> transformation method was developed. In the method, meristems of either apical or axillary buds of immature plants or apical buds of embryos in imbibed seeds, depending on plants, were inoculated by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font6"> after being pricked with a needle. The inoculated plants were grown to maturation in pots under non-sterile conditions. Transformation was demonstrated by several lines of evidence obtained with mostly the progenies of T1 generation; phenotypic inheritance from T0 plants to plants of the following generation, resistance of seed germination to antibiotics, detection of Î²-glucuronidase activity in transformants of T1 generation, detection of transgene by Southern blot and PCR analyses in T1 generation transformants and rescue from T1 generation transformants of the plasmids composed of T-DNA of binary vector and flanking plant genomic DNA. The diverse species of plants such as buckwheat (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Fagopyrum esculentum</span><span class="font6">), mulberry (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Morus alba</span><span class="font6"> L.), kenaf (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hibiscus cannabinus</span><span class="font6">), rice (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Oryza sativa</span><span class="font6">), wheat (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Triticum aestibvum</span><span class="font6"> L.), maize (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Zea mays</span><span class="font6">), and soybean (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Glycine max</span><span class="font6">) were shown to be efficiently transformed by our </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font6"> method.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Conventional transformation methods and</span><br><br><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>their disadvantages</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">I</span><span class="font7">n the conventional transformation methods being currently used, transgene is first introduced into either calli or tissues</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font7"> culture, using either </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium</span><span class="font7">-mediated method or microparticle bombardment method and then plants are regenerated on medium. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteium-</span><span class="font7">mediated method has several advantages over the microparticle bombardment method: the former allows for a more stable integration of a defined segment of DNA into plant genome and generally results in a lower copy number and fewer rearrangements than the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although the conventional transformation methods are commonly used, they have some disadvantages. First, they require sterile</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">conditions. Second, they take rather long periods of time. Third, somatic mutation or somaclonal variation occurs frequently in plant cells during </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font7"> culture. Finally, some plants are recalcitrant to regeneration. These disadvantages of the conventional methods are mainly caused by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font7"> culture of plant cells. Therefore, some </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> transformation methods, which require no </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font7"> culture of plant cells, have been reported to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional methods (Chee </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 1989; Touraev </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">.1997; Clough </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7">, 1998; Hu </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7">, 1999; Qing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7">, 2000). However, none of the reported </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> transformation methods except one for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Arabidopsis</span><span class="font7"> have been widely used because of the problem of efficiency and reproducibility (Bent, 2000). On the other hand, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> transformation method, or</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">floral dip method, for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Arabidopsis</span><span class="font7"> is reliable and thereby widely used. Unfortunately, the method is, however, applicable to only </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Arabidopsis</span><span class="font7">. Thus, we attempted to develop the general </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta </span><span class="font7">transformation method that can be applied to various plants.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>The hint for development of new method</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In our method, a meristem was selected as a target tissue for inoculation of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium. </span><span class="font7">The hint for this idea came from the experiment as follows. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kalanchoe pinnata</span><span class="font7"> has many adventitious buds on the edge of its leaf (Fig. 1A). Each bud contains a meristem with totipotency and thereby is capable to produce a whole plant. When a leaf is detached from stem and kept on soil or wet vermiculite, a young plantlet emerges from each bud in two or three weeks. The leaves from one plant are a clone, having an identical genome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The adventitious buds of one leaf were inoculated, after being pricked with a needle, by</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/13606-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:235pt;height:244pt;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Fig. 1. </span><span class="font6">Adventitious buds on leaf blade of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kalanchoe pinnata</span><span class="font6"> Lam (A) and appearance of the plants emerged from the adventitious buds inoculated by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens </span><span class="font6">(B). The plants of B- (1) are ones emerged from the buds inoculated by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumefaciens</span><span class="font6"> (LBA4404) strain containing a 2.5 kb of buckwheat cDNA with unknown function in a sense orientation. The plants of B- (2) are ones emerged from the buds inoculated by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font6"> (LBA4404 strain) containing the same cDNA in an anti-sense orientation. The plant of B- (3) is one emerged from the bud treated with water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> containing a 2.5 kb of buckwheat cDNA with unknown function in a sense orientation, while ones of another leaf from the same plant were inoculated by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens </span><span class="font7">containing the same cDNA but in an anti-sense orientation. The inoculated leaves were incubated on wet vermiculite and then transferred to separate pots to grow to mature plants. As shown in Fig.1B, the plants emerged from the respective leaf exhibited phenotypes opposite to each other; the plants from the leaf inoculated by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> containing the cDNA in a sense orientation were tall and aged earlier, while the plants from the leaf inoculated by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens </span><span class="font7">containing the cDNA in an anti-sense orientation were short and late in aging. From the result of the experiment, we were convinced that it is possible to transform plant by inoculating </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> onto meristem of a plant, but not plant cell or tissue </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font7"> culture.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Seek for a model plant and transformation procedure</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kalanchoe</span><span class="font7"> plant seemed to have great advantages as a model plant for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta </span><span class="font7">transformation; it has many big adventitious buds containing meristems on its leaf which are easy to access. Moreover, they are a clone. However, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kalanchoe</span><span class="font7"> plant has a fatal disadvantage; it is very difficult to obtain seeds. Thus, we sought for other plant as a model plant. Besides adventitious buds, meristem is included in various tissues or organs of any higher plant; it is included in a shoot, axillary bud, root tip and so on. We selected buckwheat (</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fagopyrum esculentum</span><span class="font7"> var. Shinano No.1) as a model plant because it grows rapidly and produces many seeds within three months. Using buckwheat, we made up the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta </span><span class="font7">transformation procedure as follows (Kojima </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 2000<sup>a</sup>; Kojima </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 2000<sup>b</sup>). Buckwheat seeds sterilized with sodium hypochlorite were sown on soil in a pot and grown for 4 to 5 days to a stage of 7 to 8 cm height with two expanded leaves. Two to three points in top (0 to 3 mm part from top) of hypocotyl that included an apical meristem were pricked with a needle (Ï 0.71</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">mm) and then inoculated with a cotton swab drenched with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> water suspension (ca 1.0 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml). The inoculated seedlings were kept under the unfavorable conditions, at 22<sup>0</sup>C in the dark, for 3 days to suppress defense action of plant so as to facilitate infection by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens.</span><span class="font7"> Subsequently, the seedlings were grown to maturation to set seeds (T<sub>1</sub> generation) under non-sterilized and ambient conditions. Buckwheat plants develop two types of flowers with different pistil lengths, or hetrostylism. Only pollination between different types of flowers can result in fertilization. The flowers of plants in a pot were pollinated randomly by using a plumage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Various plants such as mulberry (</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Morus alba </span><span class="font7">L.), kenaf (</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hibiscus cannabinus</span><span class="font7">), rice (</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Oryza sativa</span><span class="font7">), wheat (</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Triticum aestibvum</span><span class="font7"> L.), maize (</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Zea mays</span><span class="font7">), and soybean (G</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">lycine max</span><span class="font7">) were successfully transformed by essentially the same method as one for buckwheat described above (Ping </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7">, 2003; Kojima </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7">, 2004; Suparthana </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 2005; Suparthana </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font7"> 2006; Kojima </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 2006), except that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> was inoculated onto meristem of a different part of a plant among those plants. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> was inoculated onto meristems of axillary buds of young plants for mulberry, either apical or axillary buds of young plants for kenaf, apical buds of embryos in imbibed seeds for rice, wheat, and maize and axillary buds of decapitated seedlings for soybean.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Agrobacterium</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> is eliminated by defense action of plant</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In our transformation method, the inoculated immature plants did not receive any treatment to eliminate </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria.</span><span class="font7"> As for the inoculated imbibed seeds, they were treated once with antibiotics (</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Cefotaxime</span><span class="font7">). It seemed unlikely, however, that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium</span><span class="font7"> could be eliminated completely by such only one time antibiotic treatment. We, therefore, examined the presence of the remaining </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria</span><span class="font7"> used for transformation in the shoot apices of mature transformants in T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub>generations by the two experiments described below. No </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">was detected in the shoot apices, which produce germ cells for the next generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the conventional transformation methods, in which </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria</span><span class="font7"> are inoculated onto plant cells </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font7"> culture, it is very difficult to eliminate </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria</span><span class="font7"> completely. This may be because the conditions of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font7"> culture are suitable not only for plant cells but also for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria</span><span class="font7">. On the other hand, under natural conditions, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium</span><span class="font7"> is a rather week pathogenic bacterium; when </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria</span><span class="font7"> were inoculated onto leaves or stems of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kalanchoe </span><span class="font7">plants grown in pots, galls emerged only on the inoculated sites, never on other parts of plants. From this result, the plants grown under such natural conditions appear to be resistant enough to confine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria</span><span class="font7"> to the inoculated sites and eliminate them finally. Just like in the case above, the inoculated plants were also grown in pots under natural conditions in our </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta </span><span class="font7">transformation method. Consequently, it is the most likely that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria</span><span class="font7"> are eliminated by defense action of plant in our method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order to examine the presence of remaining </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria</span><span class="font7"> in the inoculated plants, we carried out two experiments. In the first experiment, shoot apices of mature plants in T<sub>0 </sub>and T<sub>1</sub> generations were aseptically homogenized with autoclaved water using a mortar and pestle. The homogenates were inoculated onto LB media containing various antibiotics, on which </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria</span><span class="font7"> used for transformation could grow. The inoculated media were incubated at 28<sup>o</sup>C for 3 days. No colonies appeared for any homogenates, indicating the absence of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria</span><span class="font7"> used for transformation. In the second experiment, genomic DNAs were isolated from shoot apices of mature plants in T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1 </sub>generations and subjected to PCR analysis using them as templates. When the primer sets for genes in T-DNA region of binary vector were used, PCR products were obtained, while no PCR products were obtained when the primer sets for genes outside T-DNA region of binary vector were used. This result also indicated the absence of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria</span><span class="font7"> used for transformation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Plants of T<sub>0</sub> generation are chimeras, while ones of T<sub>1</sub> generation are true transformants</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In our method, A</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">grobacteria</span><span class="font7"> were inoculated onto meristems of either apical or axillary buds of young plants or apical buds of embryos in imbibed seeds, depending on plants, in which various organs and primodia had already formed. Therefore, it is likely that the plants of T<sub>0</sub> generation are chimeras. However, it is reasoned that transformants of T<sub>1</sub> and subsequent generations produced by our method are not chimeric plants but truly transformed plants made from all transformed cells on the basis of the following consideration. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacteria</span><span class="font7"> would likely transfer transgene not only to genomes of cells of meristems but also to genomes of already differentiated cells in buds. The transgenes integrated into genomes of these already differentiated cells could determine only phenotype of lower parts of mature T<sub>0</sub> plants. In contrast, transgenes integrated into the genomes of as yet undifferentiated cells in meristems, which are destined to become apical meristems of mature plants, could contribute to production of shoot apices and hence to phenotype of mature T<sub>0</sub>plants. On maturation, germ cells (egg) and pollen (sperm) are produced by an apical meristem. An individual germ cell contains a single haploid copy of genomic DNA. Two germ cells, an egg and a sperm, produce a single fertilized cell, from which the entire body of cells of each transformant in the next generation is derived. Thus, transformants of T<sub>1</sub> and subsequent generations should not be chimeric plants but true transformants. A considerable portion of T<sub>0</sub> generation plants transformed by our method exhibited the phenotype different from that of nontransformed plants, being an indication that transgenes had been integrated efficiently in genomes of apical meristems of those mature T<sub>0</sub> generation plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Based on the above consideration, we examined the transformation and integration of transgene in genomes of transformants using plants of T<sub>1</sub> generation but not T<sub>0</sub> generation in most of the experiments.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Demonstration of transformation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">To allow transformation to be verified by various means, we used four different strains of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens,</span><span class="font7"> an avirulent M-21 mutant strain (Majumder </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7">, 2000), LBA4404 strain harboring a pBI 121 binary vector (Toyobo Co.), LBA4404 strain harboring a pIG121-Hm binary vector (Ohta </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7">, 1990) and LBA4404 strain harboring a binary vector (pBI-res2) modified for rescue of plasmid (Suparthana </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7">, 2006). M-21 strain is an avirulent mutant of which auxin synthesizing gene (</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">iaaM</span><span class="font7">) is destructed by Tn</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">5</span><span class="font7">-insertion, but all other genes including cytokinin synthesizing enzyme gene are intact. As a result, the transformants by M-21 strain were expected to synthesize a high level of cytokinin, resulting in a dramatically altered phenotype due to hormone imbalance, which is a good visible indication of transformation. Some altered phenotype also would be expected for transformants produced using other strains of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> since endogenous gene of plant might be destructed or modified by insertion of transgene into its genome. The second </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> strain, LBA4404 strain with a pBI121 binary vector, is a standard strain for transformation of plants and contains a neomycin phosphotransferaseII (nptII) gene and a Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) gene. The third </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> strain, LBA4404 strain with a pIG121-Hm binary vector, was used to indicate transformation by histochemical detection of Î²-glucuronidase as well as resistance to hygromycin B, since the pIB121-Hm binary vector contained a GUS gene with an intron and a hygromycin B resistance gene in its T-DNA. The fourth </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefacien</span><span class="font7">s strain, LBA4404 strain with a pBI-res2 binary vector, was used to demonstrate definitively integration of transgene (T-DNA) in genome of transformant by rescuing the plasmid that contained integrated T-DNA and flanking plant chromosomal DNA in a contiguous segment. The plasmids were rescued from transformants of T<sub>1</sub> generation as follows; genomic DNAs were extracted from transformants and digested with BamHI</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font7"> which did not split the segment of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ampicilin resistance gene and replication origin of pBuescript plasmid in T-DNA region of the binary vector. The digested DNAs were selfligated and then transformed into </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">E.coli</span><span class="font7">. The transformed </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">E.coli</span><span class="font7"> were screened on LB medium containing ampicilin and plasmids were isolated from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">E.coli</span><span class="font7"> grown on the medium. The structure of the isolated plasmid was determined by sequencing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many species of plants were transformed by using four strains of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> mentioned above and transformation was examined by various means. First, there appeared plants in T<sub>0 </sub>generation, which showed appearance different from that of parent plants, and their phenotype (appearance) was inherited by the progenies in the subsequent generations (Fig.2). Second, the seeds (T<sub>1</sub> generation) of wheat transformants by LBA4404 strain harboring a pIG121-Hm binary vector showed hygromycin B resistance in their germination (Fig.3). Third, the wheat transformants (T<sub>1</sub> generation) by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens </span><span class="font7">LBA4404 strain harboring a pIG121-Hm binary vector showed positive Î²-glucuronidase activity (GUS) staining (Fig.4). Fourth, transgene integration into genome was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis with the wheat transformants (T<sub>1</sub> generation) by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens </span><span class="font7">LBA4404 strain harboring a pBI-res2 (Fig. 5). Fifth, PCR analysis detected transgene (GUS gene) in the genomes of buckwheat transformants (T<sub>1</sub> generation) by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> LBA4404 strain harboring a pBI121 binary vector (Fig.6). Finally, the plasmids containing the integrated T-DNA and flanking genomic DNA in a contiguous segment were rescued from the T<sub>1</sub> generation wheat transformants by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> LBA4404 strain harboring a pBI-res2 binary vector (Fig.7).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Transformation efficiency was calculated based on the results of the analyses described above. The transformation efficiency was from 40% to 60% with most of the plants tested such as buckwheat, rice and wheat. The transformation efficiency values of 40% to 60% seemed to be extremely high as compared with those by the conventional methods reported previously.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/13606-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:235pt;height:311pt;">

The arrows indicate the positions and directions of the primers used for sequencing. The sequence of region 1 in the rescued plasmid was homologous with that of the corresponding region of the binary vector used for transformation, while the sequence of region 2 was homologous with that of a wheat genomic DNA (Acc.

<p><span class="font7">(A-208 strain, a parent strain of M-21 avirulent strain used in this paper) by piercing with a needle previously smeared with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens </span><span class="font7">and then the inoculated plants were continued to grow in a pot. After six weeks, galls were formed on every (100 %) inoculated site (Majumder </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">., 2001). It has been revealed that gall formation results from integration of T-DNA region of Ti-plasmid indwelling in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> cell into plant genome, that is, ânatural transformationâ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some reasons are conceivable for that such an efficient natural transformation, gall formation, is accomplished under the conditions mentioned above. First, the factors necessary for gall formation such as auxin, cytokinin and other as yet unidentified factors might be provided at the best time, at the optimal concentrations and in the best combinations. Second, the meristems in the plants grown in a pot should have a stronger resistance to pathogen, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">in this case, and stress and a higher capacity for differentiation and regeneration than cells or tissues </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font7"> culture. Finally, there might be significant roles in wounding of plant tissues that occurs on inoculation of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens.</span><span class="font7"> When wounded, plant should activate cell division to heal the wounded tissue. The activation of cell division must accompany activation of chromosome replication. Some special conditions allowing T-DNA to integrate effectively into plant chromosome might happen during the activated chromosome replication. Furthermore, the wounded plant also synthesizes many kinds of phenolic compounds and accumulates them in the wounded tissue and the surrounding tissue. The accumulated phenolic compounds have antimicrobial activity and so act as a chemical defense against pathogens. In addition, some of the phenolic compounds produced in response to wounding are reported to show the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">same activity as acetosyringone; they induce the genes in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">vir</span><span class="font7"> region of Ti-plasmid or helper plasmid (Bolton </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7">, 1986). Consequently, the phenolic compounds in the wounded tissue might promote integration of T-DNA into plant genome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is close similarity between gall induction on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kalanchoe</span><span class="font7"> plants by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens </span><span class="font7">mentionedabove,whereânaturaltransformationâ occurred on every (100 %) inoculated site, and our </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> transformation method; in the former case, the stems or leaves of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kalanchoe</span><span class="font7"> plants grown in pots were inoculated, accompanied by wounding, by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> and continued to grow in pots. In the later case, the meristems of immature plants were inoculated, accompanied by wounding, by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> and grown to maturation to set seeds in pots. The similarity between the two cases might account for the high transformation efficiency of our method.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Advantages of our </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> transformation method</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Generally, the transformant generated by the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> transformation method is superior to one by the conventional transformation method in that the former is the least likely accompanied with mutation since </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font7"> culture of plant sells, being prone to induce somatic mutation, is not involved in the process of the former.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition, our </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> method has four other advantages. First, it is simple as well as efficient. Third, we do not need to use a special </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> strain; instead a standard and popular strain of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7">, LBA4404 strain, is enough for our method. Finally, our method is applicable to wide species of plants. As shown in Fig.2, diverse species of crop plants have been successfully transformed by our method; they include dicotyledonous plants (buckwheat, kenaf and soybean), woody plant (mulberry) and monocotyledonous plants (rice, wheat and maize). It has been recognized that monocotyledonous crops, especially wheat and maize, are rather difficult to be transformed by the conventional transformation method using</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> (Hiei </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7">, 1994; Cheng </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font7">, 1997). This possibly has to do with the phenomenon that crown gall disease is never seen with these monocotyledonous crops on the field. It is, therefore, noteworthy that monocot crops such as rice, wheat and maize were transformed with high efficiency by our </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> transformation method.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The remaining subject with plant transformation method</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There remains an essentially important but unsolved problem with the method of plant transformation; that is the problem that we can neither designate location on the chromosome where the transgene should be integrated nor regulate the number of transgene to be integrated into chromosome. Such a present situation of plant transformation method is as if we were launching randomly a rocket without a control device toward plant cells. This situation is the case for both the conventional transformation methods and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in planta</span><span class="font7"> transformation methods. In order to solve this problem, we should develop a practical gene targeting method for plants as early as possible.</span></p>
