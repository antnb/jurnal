<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Abstract</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This study examines the effect of participation and the internal environment on transparency with performance as a mediator. PLS 3.0 was used to analyze the research data. We were collecting data using a questionnaire. The research respondents were principals, teachers, and employees of public elementary schools. The number of respondents was as many as three participants. The results showed that participation and control environment had a positive effect on performance. Performance has a positive impact on transparency. Performance can mediate the effect of participation and control environment on transparency. Schools and local governments can use performance measurement with educational scorecards to assess school performance. School performance is evaluated comprehensively, not only from the management of academic activities. Schools must pay attention to financial management performance as well. School transparency must also be considered to increase the trust of all stakeholders.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is compulsory for citizen aged 7-15 years to attend primary education. Basic education in Indonesia is elementary school and junior high school </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Article 17, Law No. 20 of 2003)</span></a><span class="font5">. Education is the door to the future of the younger generation </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Kasali, 2014)</span></a><span class="font5">. Education increase the possibility for someone to generate income </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Saraswati, 2011)</span></a><span class="font5">. The</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> OECD (2018) </span></a><span class="font5">shows that the quality of education in Indonesia still faces many problems, so primary education is crucial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Performance measurement at the school level is still not widely done. The measure of educational performance is often done from an academic point of view and at the regional level. The Human Development Index (HDI) is often one of the benchmarks for achieving educational performance. For 2019, the HDI of Jambi Province has reached 70.65, not too far behind compared to the National HDI of 71.39 </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Kemendikbud, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. In addition, the Gross Participation Rate (GPR) /</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Angka Partisipasi Kasar</span><span class="font5"> (APK) and Net Participatory Rate (NER)/ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Angka Partisipasi Bersih</span><span class="font5"> (APM) are also commonly used as other measures of educational performance achievement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">GER is the level of population participation at a level of education, regardless of the age of the population. GER is a complementary indicator of NER. NER shows the percentage of the population who attends school on time or shows how much of the population attends school at an age that is in accordance with the provisions of the school-age group at a certain level of education. The average GER of all districts/cities in Jambi Province is in the 100% position </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Kemdikbud, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. This does not indicate good performance because it shows the potential possibility that children who are not yet seven years old have entered the elementary school level </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Rahayu et al., 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">. Ideal GER score should be 100% </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Kemendikbud, 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">. This is evident from the APM, which has not yet reached 100%. The GER and NER for elementary school level in Jambi City are higher than other areas in Jambi Province, even though the junior high school level is in the lowest position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The government carries out efforts to improve the quality of education through the allocation of the education budget. The education budget is also a mandatory priority at both the national and regional levels. The amount of budget disbursed is one of the benchmarks for the government's alignment with the community and commitment to the quality of human resources </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Rahayu, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. The obligation to budget funds for the education sector at least 20% is a mandate from the law. The amount of budget allocated by the government each year for the Education Sector continues to increase. The budget is quite large, as evidenced by the 2018 national education budget allocation reaching 444.1 trillion rupiahs and increasing to 492.5 trillion rupiahs in 2019 </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Kemendikbud, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. The minimum requirement for an education budget allocation of 20% also applies at the local government level. Local governments that pay attention to the quality of education will allocate education budgets according to or close to the mandate. Jambi Province occupies the 6th position as the region with the highest budget allocation for education affairs nationally. This is evidence that Jambi Province continues to strive to improve the competence of its human resources and is committed to fulfilling the mandate of the 1945 Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the district and city levels in Jambi Province, Jambi City has the highest commitment to allocating the education budget. The budget allocation evidence this for the Education Affairs Program from the 2019 Pure APBD, which reached 16.49% (an increase of 1% compared to 2018). The budget allocation for the Education Affairs Program with regional transfers in 2019 reached 29.55% </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Kemendikbud, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. The Jambi City education budget is still far above the Regency/City in Jambi Province. In addition to these funds, districts and cities in Indonesia also can receive allocations of government aid funds (Bantah). This fund is more focused on physical development. In 2017-2018, the City of Jambi was also the recipient of the highest allocation of rebuttal funds compared to the Regency/City in Jambi Province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the enactment of</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Law no. 20 of 2003 </span></a><span class="font5">and the allocation of School Operational Assistance (SOA) funds in 2005, schools are also required to be able to manage funds effectively and efficiently. The SOA funds disbursed starting in 2005 became the main trigger for the implementation of SBM in Indonesia. SBM is the systematic decentralization of school-level authority and responsibility for decisionmaking on matters relating to school operations. The implementation of SBM requires the ability of schools to plan, implement and evaluate, and be accountable for transparent fund management to the community and government </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Mulyasa, 2002)</span></a><span class="font5">. Schools have wider financial management autonomy so that Schools today are not only</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">providers of education. Although relatively new to schools, schools must go through all stages of budgeting in schools. The principal is the manager who is responsible for managing school finances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elementary and junior high schools are the holders of the mandate to create a quality generation of the nation. Indonesian education is currently experiencing many problems. Two national figures,</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Baswedan (2014) </span></a><span class="font5">and</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Basri &amp;&nbsp;Putra (2016) </span></a><span class="font5">stated that education and the quality of Indonesian human resources are in critical and emergency conditions. So it is necessary to make improvements to improve the quality of our education. The quality of education is related to the academic aspect and in terms of financing and financial management. Education is the government's responsibility and the responsibility of all because education is a long-term investment for a country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Financing has an influence and is interrelated with the quality of education </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Saraswati, 2011)</span></a><span class="font5">. Indonesian education continues to be shackled to a low budget </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Darmaningtyas &amp;&nbsp;Subkhan, 2012)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Saraswati (2011) </span></a><span class="font5">states that neighboring countries continuously increase their education spending allocations, such as Malaysia reaching 25.2% and Thailand 25%. The Indonesian government has increased the education budget allocation since the enactment of</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Law no. 20 of 2003.</span></a><span class="font5"> However, the government includes an element of educator salaries in the budget allocation </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Saraswati, 2011)</span></a><span class="font5">. The average percentage of primary education spending on GDP in OECD countries is 6.1% on average. Indonesia is one of the countries with an allocation below 4%, only 2.9% </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(OECD, 2013)</span></a><span class="font5">. Even in 2015, it decreased to 2.5% </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(OECD, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Study about financial management in schools has not been widely studied in Indonesia</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Rahayu, 2020; Saraswati, 2011).</span></a><span class="font5"> Research in educational institutions so far has mostly looked at academic aspects such as curriculum and learning processes. At the same time, financial management is also an important aspect of achieving quality education. One of the differences with performance research often conducted in government organizations is that the performance measurement used is a comprehensive perspective (financial, internal processes, customers, and learning and growth) and from various perspectives, namely schools, employees, and teachers. This measurement is the model used in the performance of educational services measured by the educational scorecard</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Aljardali et al., 2012; Rahayu et al., 2021).</span></a><span class="font5"> This model has not been found by many researchers to be used in Indonesia. The educational scorecard model is a development of the balanced scorecard, which academics and accounting practitioners have often used to assess the performance of both private and government organizations.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Jensen &amp;&nbsp;Meckling (1976) </span></a><span class="font5">explained agency problems that arise in the company's relationship between agents and principals. Agents are parties who carry out their duties as mandated by the owners of capital. The agent is the company's management. The principal is the party who gives the trust, entrusts the money to be run by the agent. The relationship between government organizations (example: school) and society is similar to relationship between agents and principals </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Nor et al., 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. Problems in the relationship between the two arise because of the information asymmetry between the two parties. Agents have wider access to information on organization activities because they directly manage its operations. Due to opportunistic behavior, agents often take advantage of this access to information to benefit themselves or certain groups. This attitude, of course, can harm the principal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Schools are the recipients of the mandate to manage public funds to carry out educational activities. Agency theory's point of view is schools as agents while society as principals. Early development of Agency theory by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Jensen &amp;&nbsp;Meckling (1976) </span></a><span class="font5">in private organizations. Problems with the relationship between agents and principals also occur in government agencies.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Halim dan Abdullah (2006) </span></a><span class="font5">state that agency problems in local government are continuous and interrelated at all levels. Schools as trustees schools must manage funds in an accountable and transparent manner. Schools cannot be separated from their environment because schools are influenced and affect their environment. Schools that are given greater autonomy and can work with their stakeholders will be successful </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(OECD, 2013)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this agency relationship, it can become a problem if the school management, in this case, is led by the principal, being opportunistic like the company management. Participation and transparency must be increased in school financial management mechanisms. Participation and transparency are consequences of implementing SBM. SBM provides management autonomy to schools from an operational and financial perspective </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Mulyasa, 2002)</span></a><span class="font5">. In implementing SBM, cooperation between schools and all stakeholders is needed to determine the programs and activities run by the school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The achievement of the implementation of programs and activities is a measure of performance. The work of public sector organizations is directly related to providing goods and services to meet the wants and needs of the community. Therefore, participation is needed to support the achievement of the performance of government organizations. Collaboration between the Indonesian government and civil society organizations to generate ideas and actions to encourage the implementation of values in order to create clean, effective, democratic, and reliable governance.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Rahayu (2020)</span></a><span class="font5"> proves that principals who are closed and tend not to open up to the involvement of others have lower performance than schools that apply participatory principles. The performance of public organizations must be seen comprehensively in their success in meeting the community's needs. The performance of government organizations can not only be measured from the financial. The non-financial measure is the most important. This relates to the duties and functions of government organizations is to provide quality services to the community</span><span class="font6">.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Kaplan &amp;&nbsp;Norton (1992) </span></a><span class="font5">introduced the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) concept, which is a comprehensive performance measurement tool for companies. Previously, companies were only measured from financial aspects such as Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Investment (ROI), profit levels, or other economic measures. BSC adds three more perspectives: internal business aspects, learning and growth aspects, and customer aspects. These four perspectives then developed into performance indicators with the BSC concept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The educational scorecard is a school performance assessment developed from the BSC. The BSC for educational institutions has been developed by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Aljardali et al.</span></a><span class="font5"> (2012), which is also known as the Educational scorecard </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Griggs et al., 2012)</span></a><span class="font5">. This model is used in Lebanon to measure the performance of the public university. Its development is used in higher education institutions. In this study, researchers tried to use the scorecard for primary education institutions, referring to</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Rahayu et al. (2021)</span></a><span class="font5"> and</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Aly &amp;&nbsp;Mansour (2017),</span></a><span class="font5"> and</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Rompho (2020).</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">Four Perspectives on the Educational scorecard, namely the customer perspective, try to see how customers, especially parents, assess the performance of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">education services in schools. Some of the indicators used are school programs and activities with high scores, parental satisfaction, the number of complaints from parents or the community towards the school, the professionalism of teachers and staff, and the quality of instruction used by the school. Internal Business Perspective looks at how schools develop services, facilities, resources, facilities for students, teachers, and staff, quantity and quality of internal and external coordination meetings attended by schools, and provide customer complaint response services. The Perspective of innovation and learning looks at how schools create and innovate in the learning process. Some things that can be used as indicators are innovation and curriculum changes, the level of innovation made by teachers in learning, motivation, and self-development of staff, and academic activities supporting professionalism followed by staff or teachers. Financial Perspective looks at the effectiveness and efficiency of school financial management. This can be seen from the quality of budget allocations, financial support for academic and extracurricular activities, and policies in budget allocations. A comprehensive evaluation will provide an overview of the organization's performance in real terms so that it is expected to be the basis for making appropriate policies for both schools and local governments. The control environment is support for achieving school performance. Government organizations are required to implement transparency. Some of the benefits for government organizations that implement transparency include increased trust and mutual control with stakeholders to ensure that funds are used for the benefit of the community </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Rahayu, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. Transparency is the openness of access to information for the public to the required information. Transparency means the accessibility of stakeholders to all management and implementation information from both administrative and management aspects, including finance. Public agencies must be open in conveying various public information </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Nor et al., 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. Transparency for government organizations is a response to regulations. every organization must send information including financial to stakeholders as part of signaling organizational performance </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Hadi et al., 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. Two aspects of the principle of public policy transparency, namely (1) public communication by the government and (2) the public's right to access information </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Rahayu, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. These two aspects also influence the transparency of public policies. Both will be very difficult to do if the government does not handle its performance properly. Public communication demands government efforts to open and disseminate relevant information and activities. Transparency must be balanced, with the need for institutional confidentiality and information that affects individual privacy rights. Good performance will encourage transparency to customers </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Rahayu, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. One of the elements of good governance is participation as a determining factor in achieving performance in government. Because, it can improve individual performance, job crafting behaviors and can reduce role conflict and stress </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Berdicchia &amp;&nbsp;Masino, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. Participation is the involvement of all parties in problemsolving and decision-making </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Wagner, 1994)</span></a><span class="font5">. Participation can improve performance </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Berdicchia &amp;&nbsp;Masino, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5"> in government organizations and can streamline spending. </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Wardhani et al. (2017).</span></a><span class="font5"> In addition to improving performance, participation has also been shown to increase employee satisfaction </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Wagner, 1994)</span></a><span class="font5"> and reduce conflict </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Berdicchia &amp;&nbsp;Masino, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. The active participation of parents, teachers, and school employees can increase the achievement of school performance </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Rahayu, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">H</span><span class="font1">1</span><span class="font5">: Participation has a Positive Effect on Performance</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The control environment is the most important element of the internal control system in government organizations. The control environment forms the basis for the other control components. The control environment creates a conducive organizational structure and environmental conditions that impact other elements of internal control. However, the internal control system is essential for public and private organizations </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Ayimpoya et al., 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. Internal control can improve the performance of higher education institutions in Zanzibar. The element of internal control that can affect performance is the control environment because it has an impact on operations and other system elements </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Omar &amp;&nbsp;Yussuf, 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Ayimpoya et al. (2020) </span></a><span class="font5">also proves that the internal control environment can improve organizational performance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">H</span><span class="font1">2</span><span class="font5">: Control Environment Positively Affects School Performance</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Transparency can be done by the government through the delivery of information to the public. Submission of information through the website is a trend that is widely used by the government today. This is often referred to as the implementation of e-government. The performance of e-government has a significant positive impact on the government </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Reddick, 2004)</span></a><span class="font5">. E-government is a form of interaction between the government and stakeholders. E-government is a form of increasing transparency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good government financial performance will improve information delivery to the public </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Laswad et al., 2005)</span></a><span class="font5">. High performance is a signal of good public management </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Christiaens, 1999)</span></a><span class="font5">. Local governments with poor performance will avoid voluntary disclosure (such as voluntary internet-based disclosure) and will prefer to limit access to information for the public </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Craven &amp;&nbsp;Marston, 1999)</span></a><span class="font5">. The audit opinion is also often seen as a performance for local governments. Local governments with good audit opinions tend to be more transparent </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Nor et al., 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. Local governments with high public welfare are required to be more transparent for financial and non-financial information </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Rahim &amp;&nbsp;Martani, 2016)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The results of previous studies have proven that participation affects performance</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Berdicchia &amp;&nbsp;Masino, 2019; Wagner, 1994; Wardhani et al., 2017),</span></a><span class="font5"> including in educational organizations such as schools </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Rahayu, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. The effect of performance on transparency has also been proven by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Laswad et al., 2005; Nor et al.,</span></a><span class="font5"> 2019). Previous research has positioned performance as the dependent variable of participation and the independent variable to transparency. Therefore, this study uses performance as a mediating variable for the effect of participation on transparency.

<p><span class="font5">Implementation of the internal control environment is the responsibility of management, but the role of internal parties also determines its implementation </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Rahayu et al., 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">. A good control environment will improve performance</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Ayimpoya</span></a><span class="font5"> et al., 2020; Omar &amp;&nbsp;Yussuf, 2021). Implementing the government's internal control system, including the control environment, has a positive influence on increasing transparency </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Listari et al., 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. The performance also positively influences transparency</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Craven &amp;&nbsp;Marston, 1999; Rahim &amp;&nbsp;Martani, 2016).</span></a><span class="font5"> Previous research has proven that performance is the dependent variable of the control environment and the independent variable in relation to transparency.

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Research Method</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The respondents of this study were principals, teachers, and employees of public elementary schools in Jambi City. Jambi City was chosen because it is one of the regional governments with the highest education budgets in Jambi Province. The total population of this study was 3,220 people. The researcher used Yamane's formula to determine the minimum sample size. The precision used in this study is 5%, so the minimum sample calculated is 355.80, then it is fulfilled to be 356 people. This sample size will be allocated proportionally based on the number of schools and teachers, staff, and principals for six school areas in Jambi City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The type of data used in this study is primary data collected by the survey questionnaire method. This study used a survey design with closed questionnaires. The questionnaire used a semantic differential with seven alternatives: starting from very dissatisfied (1) until very satisfied (7). Researchers distributed 356 questionnaires. The number of returned questionnaires was 324, but there were 22 questionnaires that could not be processed. So that only 320 questionnaires can be processed further in this study. Based on the questionnaires that have been collected by the research team, it can be seen that the number of questionnaires that can be further processed in this study is 320 questionnaires.

<p><span class="font5">The research team also distributed a different number of questionnaires to groups of respondents for each sub-district. The amount is determined based on the proportional number of each group in the sub-district. Three groups of respondents in the school consist of the Principal, Teachers, and Employees. Most of the respondents came from the teacher group, as many as 72.52 percent or 219 teachers. Then followed by the employee group as many as 63 people or 20.86 people and finally from the main group as many as 20 people or 6.62 percent.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5">The dominant age of the respondents was in the age group of 26-35 years, as many as 92 people or 30.55%. The dominant respondents are women, namely 79.10%. This is following the current condition of the education world, which shows that the profession of teachers and employees in schools and principals is mostly carried out by women. Most of the respondents in this study were in the group of more than 15 years. This can be used as one of the benchmarks to show the respondent's work experience. The number of respondents with more than 15 years of service was 123 people or 40.7%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The results of the convergent validity test are carried out using outer loading. The threshold used is 0.7, meaning that the indicator is considered valid if a factor loading value is above 0.7.

<p><span class="font5">Based on</span><a href="#bookmark11"><span class="font5"> Table 1.</span></a><span class="font5">, it can be seen that all indicators have been declared valid because they already have an outer loading value of more than 0.7.

The Average Variance Extracted (AVE) value is presented in</span><a href="#bookmark12"><span class="font5"> Table 2.</span></a><span class="font5"> Convergent validity is also measured using the AVE value, which must be more than 0.5.

One example is the farewell activity of students who have completed their studies. In the implementation process, parents can be actively involved in the process of implementing school activities. Forms of involvement include being on a committee and participating in school activities. In addition, parents can also monitor the implementation of the school budget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Testing the hypothesis 2 shows a coefficient value of 0.474 with a p-value of 0.000 less than 0.05. This means that the hypothesis is proven, meaning that the controlled environment can positively affect school performance. The better the internal control environment, the higher the school's performance. The internal control environment indicators include a commitment to the quality of human resources, placement and assignment under their competencies, a clear division of duties and responsibilities, and commitment to ethical enforcement. A good control environment can certainly be a driving force for school performance to increase. Principals who have integrity will be more appreciated by parents, stakeholders, and authorized officials. Integrity simply shows the compatibility between actions and words. Principals with a character of integrity will also gain trust and must commit to achieve school performance. School performance is not only academic but also non-academic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Commitment and clear division of authority from control environment indicators will be able to support increased transparency. Principals who are committed to providing opportunities for all stakeholders to participate actively will certainly increase transparency. This, of course, will be inversely proportional, with the principal closing himself off to involve other parties in the management of school finances. A clear division of duties between the principal's role as manager, school treasurer, and the recording and reporting department will also increase school accountability. Schools will process school financial reports faster with a good distribution of authority. This, of course, will also improve the school's internal control. One of the causes of frequent delays in financial reporting is that the functions are carried out by one person, so there is no mutual control between the implemented functions. Transparency in school financial management also requires the principal's commitment to be brave and open to stakeholders. The results of this study are in line with</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Ayimpoya et al. (2020) </span></a><span class="font5">and</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Omar</span></a><span class="font5"> &amp;&nbsp;Yussuf (2021). The control environment has an important role in improving performance.

<p><span class="font5">Testing the hypothesis 3 shows a coefficient value of 0.439 with a p-value of 0.000 less than 0.05. This means that the hypothesis is proven, meaning that performance is able to affect school transparency positively. The higher the performance, the school's transparency will also increase. The results of this study are in line with</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Christiaens, 1999; Laswad et al., 2005; Nor et al., 2019),</span></a><span class="font5"> which also proves that performance affects transparency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Technical guidelines for managing school finances contained in the Minister of Education and Culture Regulation regulate the form of transparency of school funds. Schools are required to be transparent in managing school operational funds and other funds. The use of funds must be under the school's financial budget plan. The form of transparency, especially school finances, is conveyed through meetings with parents, announcements on school bulletin boards, or in writing. Up-to-date information about the implementation of school programs and activities and the position (source and use)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of school funds will increase parents' trust. Parents will finally support school activities well, so they will actively participate in achieving school performance. Otherwise, if there is no disclosure of information will have an impact on distrust and indifference of parents to school activities. Parents feel they are not involved, so they don't need to be too active. This, of course, will have an impact on the relationship between the school and parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Based on testing the hypothesis 4, the coefficient value is 0.349 with a p-value of 0.000, which is smaller than 0.05. This means that the hypothesis is proven, meaning that school performance can mediate the effect of participation on school performance. Direct participation can also affect school transparency. Therefore, school performance becomes a mediator in the form of partial mediation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The results of this study reflect that performance can be an intervening variable of participation in school transparency. Schools do require the participation of all school stakeholders, both internal and external. The internal parties of the school include teachers and school staff. At the same time, external parties can be parents, committees, parties from the Education Office and the community, and other stakeholders. The school's financial budget plan is not prepared independently by the principal but involves teachers, employees, and other stakeholders.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Rahayu (2020)</span></a><span class="font5"> found that stakeholders can participate in the planning, implementation and supervision stages of school activities.

Participation in the supervision stage can be in the form of ensuring that the activities carried out by the school remain according to the mutually agreed plan. This participation can encourage commitment to achieve good school performance as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Based on testing the hypothesis 5, the coefficient value is 0.330 with a p-value of 0.000, smaller than 0.05. This means that the hypothesis is proven, meaning that performance can become a mediator for the influence of the control environment on school transparency. The mediating role of school performance in this relationship is partial mediation. A good control environment will support performance which will ultimately increase school transparency. Good internal control will be reflected in a good internal control environment so as to create a safe, orderly, and conducive working atmosphere for employees and teachers as well as a comfortable environment for students to go to school. A comfortable work environment will provide opportunities for employees to increase creativity and not experience stress. This will have an impact on individual performance </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Omar &amp;&nbsp;Yussuf, 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">. The indicator that has the highest influence on the control environment is the commitment of the school principal/leader to enforce discipline and deviation. The principal's commitment is to determine the school can achieve good performance and finally dare to be transparent. The principal is the manager, the determinant of the direction of school policies and activities </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Rahayu,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2020)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This study proves that participation affects school performance. This means that the higher the level of participation, the higher the school's performance. The internal control environment affects school performance. A good internal environment will be able to encourage the improvement of school performance. Performance affects school transparency. Schools with good performance tend to increase transparency to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">stakeholders. School performance has also been shown to be a mediator for the influence of the control environment on transparency. In addition, school performance has also been shown to mediate the effect of participation on school transparency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The limitations of this study include that data collection is only done predominantly using a questionnaire via a google form link. Researchers cannot conduct direct interviews with respondents because the research was conducted during the Covid 19 pandemic. Reinforcement of information that can be obtained through interviews cannot be obtained through closed questionnaires. This study also only uses one element of the internal control system, namely the control environment. Although the control environment is the most important element in the internal control system, it is still not able to reflect all other elements of internal control. The implications of this research for schools must open space for stakeholders to participate. The condition of the control environment must also continue to be improved because it can improve school performance. A conducive schoolwork environment will also provide comfort for students. Local governments must pay attention to school performance comprehensively (financial and non-financial). Further researchers can develop this research by adding other elements of internal control, namely risk assessment, information and communication systems, control, and monitoring activities as additional variables. One of the theoretical implications of this research is the concept and indicators of school performance measurement that combines financial and nonfinancial. The results of this study prove that the balanced scorecard can also be used in public school organizations. The research model generated from this study is also a separate finding. This model can be developed further in further research.</span></p>
