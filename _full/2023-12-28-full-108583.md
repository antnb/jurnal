<h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a condition in which chronic hyperglycemia occurs due to insulin resistance or decreased insulin secretion by the pancreas. This condition is caused by several factors, such as excessive caloric intake, genetics, obesity, lack of physical activity, and dysbiosis of the normal flora in the gastrointestinal tract. <sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The number of people suffering from type 2 DM continues to increase year by year worldwide. According to 2021 International Diabetes Federation, there are 537 million people who have type 2 DM and it’s estimated to continue to increase by 46% in 2046. It has become one of the global health problems, where type 2 DM requires more attention to be able to control their diabetic control and to prevent complications. <sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Patients with type 2 DM usually have several &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comorbidities &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;including,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">hypertension. The incidence of hypertension in type 2 DM patients reach more than 75%. Hypertensive conditions in type 2 DM patients will increase the risk of cardiovascular complications 4 times greater than in type 2 DM patients without hypertension. <sup>[3]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hypertension requires special attention, including comprehensive therapy that involves health care workers to plan and achieve treatment goals, such as control of glycemic profiles, blood pressure, and prevent the complications. <sup>[2,4]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the main therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus with hypertension, it is very important to fulfill the nutritional needs of type 2 DM patients with </span><span class="font2">70</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">hypertension. One of the concerns those patients is the status of commensal gastrointestinal bacteria. Several studies have shown that the composition of the commensal gastrointestinal bacteria was altered in patients with type 2 DM with hypertension compared to patients without type 2 DM with hypertension. Patients with type 2 DM and hypertension were known to have dysbiosis of the commensal gastrointestinal bacteria, or it is commonly referred to as gut dysbiosis. The arised commensal abnormalities lead to more gram-negative bacteria, thus causing systemic a inflammation, reducing the insulin action, increasing insulin resistance, and also causing the endothelial dysfunction that increasing blood pressure in patients. <sup>[1,5]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Administration of probiotics to type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension aimed to correct imbalances of the normal flora in the gastrointestinal tract and reduce inflammatory mediators. In addition, probiotics can improved nutritional status in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. The bacteria in the probiotics produced </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shortchain fatty acids</span><span class="font3"> (SCFAs), which also helped reducing inflammatory mediators, such us interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor </span><span class="font1">α </span><span class="font3">(TNF-</span><span class="font1">α</span><span class="font3">) and tumor growth factor β (TGF- β), and the gram-positive bacteria like lactobacillus spp. metabolized nutrients from the food that consumed by patients into substances, which was easier to be absorbed through the patient`s gastrointestinal tract, thus improve the nutritional status in type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension. <sup>[5,6,7]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This review aims to describe how type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension exposed to gut dysbiosis, the impact of inflammatory mediators on, and the effect of probiotics for type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension.</span></p>

All articles in the form of reviews, randomized control trials, and meta-analyses were selected and reviewed by the authors and then compiled for writing this review.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ROLE OF COMMENSAL GASTROINTESTINAL BACTERIA IN NORMAL CONDITIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract acts as an immunomodulator, protects the gastrointestinal tract, and influences the structure and function of the gastrointestinal tract. The mechanism and role of normal flora bacteria varies depending on the species. There are bacteria be able to regulate dendritic cells, increase IgA secretion, or maintain the barrier of the gastrointestinal tract. <sup>[7] </sup>a. Maturation and Development of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mucosal and Systemic Immunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Certain of commensal bacterias have specific structures that can stimulate the host's immune system. When pathogens enter the body, the bacteria stimulate the immune system. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lactobacillus species </span><span class="font3">(</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lactobacillus spp</span><span class="font3">.) has a regulating effect on dendritic cells, leading to T cells differentiation and release of inflammatory mediators against these pathogens, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lactobacillus spp.</span><span class="font3"> also modulates the T cells to produce antiinflammatory mediators for body homeostasis. The cell walls gramnegative bacteria were made of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This LPS stimulates the formation of solitary lymphoid follicles (ILFs) through signaling from nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1). LPS also binds to tool-like receptors (TLRs) and releases inflammatory mediators. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Phylum bacterioides</span><span class="font3"> has the ability to stimulate Th17 cells, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">E. coli</span><span class="font3"> can upregulate dendritic cells to activate the host's immune system. <sup>[7]</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font3">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gastrointestinal Mucosal Tolerance Commensal bacteria such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lactobacillus spp.</span><span class="font3"> maintain the gastrointestinal barrier by inducing TLSP in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thetaiomicron</span><span class="font3"> bacteria inhibit NF-kB activation, preventing the formation of pro-inflammatory mediators and also improving the function of gastrointestinal mucosal barrier function. <sup>[7]</sup></span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulates Proliferation of Commensal Gastrointestinal Bacteria</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The commensal bacteria of the digestive tract may become overgrowth. When this situation occurs, gram negative bacteria such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bacterioides</span><span class="font3"> stimulate the gastrointestinal mucosa to produce IgA and control bacterial growth in the gastrointestinal tract. <sup>[7]</sup></span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protective Agent by Reducing Inflammatory Mediators</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Bacteria in the digestive tract have enzymes that can ferment and metabolize &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carbohydrates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Carbohydrates are broken down into monosaccharides and oligosaccharides and fermented into SFCA. The resulting SCFA is composed of propionic acid, butyric acid, and acetic acid with a composition ratio of 1:1:3. These formed SCFAs can induce the expression of LL-37 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cathelicidin</span><span class="font3">. Furthermore, SCFAs are taken up by gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Another function of SCFAs is to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">butyrate</span><span class="font3">, which has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. <sup>[5,8]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ASSOCIATION OF GUT DYSBIOSIS AND TYPE 2 DM WITH HYPERTENSION</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The main conditions that alter the commensal gastrointestinal bacteria are the presence of an unbalanced diet and obesity. An imbalanced diet with high</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">in carbohydrates and sugars reduces pH changes in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to an imbalance in the bacterial composition. A fatty diet also influences this state of gut dysbiosis. Individuals who consume high-fat foods have increased numbers of the gram negative bacterial such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bacteroides, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clostridium,</span><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enterobacteriaceae</span><span class="font3">. These reduce the number of SCFA- and butyrateproducing bacteria in patients with type 2 DM and hypertension. <sup>[6,8]</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pathophysiology Of Gut Dysbiosis In Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus With Hypertension</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Hight diets in carbohydrates, sugars, and fats cause changes in the composition of the commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. In diabetic patients with hypertension, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bacteroides </span><span class="font3">which are gram negative bacteria are more numerous than </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Firmicutes</span><span class="font3"> which are gram positive. <sup>[5,7]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the number of gram-negative bacteria increase, the production of endotoxins &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;derived &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, increases. The endotoxin produced increases the permeability of the gastrointestinal cell wall and causes impaired cross-linking of the gastrointestinal membrane, which allows endotoxin to enter the systemic circulation. Endotoxin then binds to TLR-4 in adipose tissue, triggering the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, endotoxin also upregulates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), causing the release of proinflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor </span><span class="font1">α </span><span class="font3">(TNF-</span><span class="font1">α) </span><span class="font3">and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which can increase insulin resistance and will cause hyperglycemia. <sup>[5]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These proinflammatory mediators will lead to oxidative stress and free radicals. These free radicals oxidize LDL and then oxidized LDL inhibit the </span><span class="font2">72</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">production of nitric oxide from endothelial cells. It increases the production of endothelin-1 which acts as a vasoconstrictor and leading to an increase in blood pressure. <sup>[5,9,10]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ROLE OF INFLAMMATION MEDIATORS IN TYPE 2 DM WITH HYPERTENSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Inflammatory mediators that play a critical role in the process of type 2 DM and hypertension are interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor </span><span class="font1">α </span><span class="font3">(TNF-</span><span class="font1">α)</span><span class="font3">, and tumor growth factor β (TGF-β). The pro-inflammatory mediator IL-6 will result in activation of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) protein which results in signal disturbances in signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B (STAT5B). This is one of the transducers on insulin binding to insulin receptor. The disruption of STAT5B signaling impairs insulin signaling and ultimately leads to insulin resistance.<sup>[11]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The TNF-α causes insulin resistance by activating Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) causes disruption of serine 307 phosphorylase in IRS-1. It results in impaired insulin signaling at insulin receptors and contribute to insulin resistance. <sup>[11]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A pro-inflammatory mediators TGF-β, play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) increase TGF-β. TGF-β plays a role in the repair process of injured cells, but persistent activation of TGF-β leads to collagen accumulation, excessive vascular proliferation, decreased elasticity of the vessel wall, end up in a state of endothelial dysfunction and furthermore an inflammation cause an increase in blood pressure. <sup>[11]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ROLE OF PROBIOTICS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AND HYPERTENSION CONDITIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lactobacillus spp</span><span class="font3">. is one of the most studied probiotic strains recently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lactobacillus spp</span><span class="font3">. belongs to the phylum </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Firmicutes</span><span class="font3"> which is a gram-positive bacterium. It has the effect of reducing pro-inflammatory mediators and may prevent the development of pathogenic bacteria in certain conditions such as diabetes mellitus and infections. <sup>[12]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lactobacillus</span><span class="font3"> has the effect of increasing the barrier function and permeability of the gastrointestinal mucosa by increasing the cross-linking between the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa. It can also decreases circulating lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria in the systemic circulation and enhance the release of glucagon-like peptide 1, leading to insulin release from the pancreas. <sup>[12]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Modulatory effects of dendritic cells on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lactobacillus spp.</span><span class="font3"> cause alterations in the regulation of regulatory T cells (Treg) that affect the homeostatic regulation of immune processes in the body. Through dendritic cell regulation, these cells are recognized by T cells, which differentiate into helper T-1 &nbsp;&nbsp;(Th-1) cells, then</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">subsequently produce IL-10 as antiinflammatory mediator and produces interferon gamma (IFNγ) that protects other cells. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lactobacillus</span><span class="font3"> species such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">L. acidophilus</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">L. plantarum</span><span class="font3"> have inhibitory effects on pro-inflammatory mediators such as Il-6 and TNF-α. <sup>[12,13]</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Probiotics also cause an increase in the barrier function of the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Administration of probiotics increase protein adhesions, namely </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">β-catenin</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">E-cadherin</span><span class="font3">, which can stabilize cross-linking of epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. <sup>[6]</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Abnormalities &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normal</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">gastrointestinal microbiota lead to chronic inflammation, which results in increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators cause increased insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction leading to type 2 DM and hypertension or exacerbating both diseases. Probiotics are used as additional therapy to the main treatment of type 2 diabetes with hypertension, including to control blood sugar profile and blood pressure and to prevent the complications of both diseases. Probiotics have been found to be effective in lowering fasting blood glucose levels, 2-hour postprandial blood glucose levels, lowering blood pressure, reducing pro-inflammatory mediators and increasing anti-inflammatory mediators. Further studies with a larger number of patients are recommended to determine the greater effect of the probiotic administration and possible side effect monitoring, in type 2 diabetic patient with hypertension.</span></p>
