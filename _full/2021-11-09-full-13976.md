<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Nîtisậstra</span><span class="font4"> is a type of non-narartive old Javanese poetry</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font4"> It contains moral teaching and governing politics. One of the teachings is the ethic of students in learning which is necessary to be adopted. The ethic states that during learning period students are not allowed to get married.The way of the implementation of the ethic is through disgracing women, so it as negative meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The theory applied in analyzing the vision of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nîtisậstra</span><span class="font4"> towards women is the theory of literary deconstruction. Literary deconstruction states that there is an implicit meaning within the existence of meaning in a piece of literary work. In order to reveal the implicit meaning, the literary work needs to be open into its parts and then deconstructed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nîtisậstra</span><span class="font4"> reveals that women has their own weaknesses such: stupid, the way of their thinking is hard to be followed by men, dishonest,the cause of all misery, and even it can be as the cause of a war or a world destruction. So it gives negative judgement.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nîtisậstra`s</span><span class="font4"> judgment as stated above signals there is an implicit meaning in it. It is the meaning of “fear and obedient” with the existence of women.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

The differences can be seen in the form of presentation of the text within it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nîtisậstra kakawin</span><span class="font4">, if it is viewed from the presentation of the text, it is belong to non-narrative literary work. It means that, it does not contain element of narration. In general </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kakawin</span><span class="font4"> is a narrative literary work, and it contains “narration/story”, series of events, characters and it marks by stages of time (Zaimar et.al, 2011:47), on the other hand, these elements are not exist in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Nîtisậstra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Nîtisậstra</span><span class="font4"> if it is viewed from its form of narration is a descriptive </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kakawin. </span><span class="font4">Descriptive means there is a representation or pictures of something from the writer. Besides, the dialogues are in the form of monologue; it means </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kakawin</span><span class="font4"> does not contain elements of dialogues in it.The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kakawin</span><span class="font4"> which have the same form of presentation with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Nîtisậstra</span><span class="font4"> are: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Nirȃrtha Prakŗȇta, Kakawin Pŗalambang Bhȃsa Wȇwatȇkan, Kakawin Atlas Bhumi,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Sabhalangȍ</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>

A part from these, the stanzas also encompass views on women.

<p><span class="font4">Etymologically </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nîtiṡậstra</span><span class="font4"> derives from Sanskrit words; they are the words </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nîti</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sậstra.</span><span class="font4"> The word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nîti</span><span class="font4"> derives from the first class of Sanskrit verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nî</span><span class="font4"> which has the meaning “to lead”; to bring; to get married; to ensure; to decide; to trace; to instruct; to teach; and to train.Then it turns to the form </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nīti</span><span class="font4"> which means: supervision, to conduct; to gain, supporters, support, policy, wise, and ethic (Surada,2007;190).</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Overview on Feminism and Deconstruction</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feminism, Feminis and Feminin</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Feminism</span><span class="font4"> is a new concept on women movement in literary theory (post modern). In the year 1960<sup>th</sup>was not the beginning of the emergence of the theory of feminism in literature it can be assumed new; because there was a new movement on tradition of the way of thinking of women which were related to literature. It indicates that the modernity on the way of thinking and the old movement which owned their own classical books, that diagnose the problems of inequality of women in the society as it was being proposed (Barry, 2010:141). Furthermore it was said that the women movement during the 1960<sup>th</sup> as the cause of the emergence of feminism literary criticism of the present day. Women realize the significance of the women image which was being brought into wide spread of fame in literature, they view that it is very importsnt for them to struggle and question its authority and coherence. In the 1970<sup>th</sup> feminism crictics was aim at the effort to analyse on patriarchy mechanism. It means there is a way of thinking of men and women culturally which is constantly viewed the inequality of sexes. Certainly, it has been more emphasized on the view of the male writers who state women as objects.They construct women images which influences their works, this conditioned can be assumed that women `ready to fight` and in a polemic (Barry,2010;143).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The above description stated on the 1980<sup>th</sup> era the feminism critique was more dynamics. The feminism critics it turned out to be more ecletics from the previous era. Their intention were focused more on the attacking men relate to thier world which become the investigation, and the point of view of women. On the other hand, it is alsoreconstructed writings on women who were under oppression /being disgraced or even vanish. The focus of intention was also shifted on the needs of reconstructing the importance of women writing by rewriting them, so the disappearance of the women role former time, it was being</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Accreditation:--</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">emphasized and given priority. The existence of change of focus means there was changes from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">androteks</span><span class="font4">(males literary works) to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">`ginoteks</span><span class="font4">(female literary works).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Feminiscan be assumed as `political postion`, while feminism means female biologically. Feminism means women`s concept or `a school in a literary world`. This paper, a part from pro and contradict towards the theory of feminism, describes the deconstruction of women which were being discussed in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">KakawinNītiṡȃstra</span><span class="font4">.Redescribing the implicit meaning on women (feminine) which were describe in the stanzas of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kakawin</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The word deconstruction relates to Jacques Derrida in his book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">De Lagrammatologie</span><span class="font4">,I and II. He was born on the 15<sup>th</sup> of July 1930 from a Jewish family EL Biar, Aljazair (Fayadi, 2005:252). His article was published on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Critique</span><span class="font4">magazine which were published in 1965 and 1966(Kaelan, 2009:252).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Deconstruction is a name given to the critique when the opposition was being weaken partly or it can be shown that some of them weakening each other in their textual meaning (Eagleton,2010;191, Piliang, 2010;125). Deconstruction is a method of analysis which was developed by Derrida by opening the language codes, particularly the opposition of the pair, so it can create an endlessly play of sign and without final meaning (Piliang, 2010;16).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hoed (2003;153) states that: The theory of deconstruction proposed by Derrida exists as a critique to the theory of sign proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure. Sign is seen as the relation between </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">significant</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">signifie.</span><span class="font4">The meaning of a sign is based on semiology`s differences. In reality the relation between </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">signifiant</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">signifie</span><span class="font4"> is dynamic. It means this relation is often </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font4">not reveal yet and given new meaning.The argumentation strengthen it, that in French language the word `</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">differer`</span><span class="font4">is not only has the meaning `difference` but it also has the meaning `to postpone`. Further it was said that the relation between `signifiant` and `signifie` or between form and meaning is dynamic. The meaning does not gain only through differences but it also can be achived through simiology postpone. That is the reason he proposed new term </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">difference,</span><span class="font4"> (the letter </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> is replaced by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font4">). Deconstructive theory is applied to find out theis unreveal meaning on women in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nȋtiṡȃstra Kakawin</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">That is the reason why women are not able to work. If that condition what is the used of to get a woman.Women are also strong in having coitus. Their strength is eight time compare to men.

<p><span class="font4">On the other stanza of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nîtiṡậstra,</span><span class="font4"> proposed a way to choose a woman as a wife. This stanza is controversial to the above stanzas. On the three stanzas above, the existence of women was being disgraced and humiliated, but on the other points there are two stanzas which give suggestion to choose women. Eventhough the choice being proposed was very thight and selective. In choosing a woman to be a wife, it is advisable not to choose a woman who has loud voice. A woman who has loud voice is considered as an arrogant person show off, and the type.vDo not choose a handicapped woman, a woman who has bad smell, begger, and woman who has small breasts. Do not choose a vicious woman who comes from a disgraced decendants.The woman that can be choose is only the woman who has big breasts, beautiful, behave well, prominent decendant and is a virgin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The description on 2.2 above states that deconstruction is a name given to a critique operational which was partly weakened, or it was shown as weaken each other within the textual process of mening. As an example a woman is an opponent “other party” from man (binary opposition). He who is not a male, is given negative value in relation with male as main principle. As the party that is assumed as the opponent of man, so woman is being weakens, humiliated, and even being disgraced. Deconstruction will open the meaning and find out unrevealed meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the stanzas of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kakawin</span><span class="font4"> above if it is well analyze, maily if it is related to the condition of the woman recently, so it can be seen there some irrelevant things or even contradictory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 15<sup>th</sup> stanza above stated that since previous time woman such as: Dewi Renuka, Dewi Sita and Dewi Drupadi caused the terrible wars. Then the doomsday was caused by all women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let us put our attention to the First and the Second World wars were not caused by women.The war in Malvinas between England and Argentina, the war in Afganistan, Iraq, crisis or civil wars in Vietnam, the tension in Korea; between North and South Korea, and war in Ukraina which happens recently, none of it caused by the bad beahviour of women. But, these wars are caused by ambition, politics and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The woman that was being placed as opposition in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nītiṡȃstra</span><span class="font4"> was a very beautiful ideal woman has class or from a noble decendant, so she becomes the target of all men. Greedy men, who are being enslaved by their lust, will try to get her in a deceitful way. Like the figure of Rahwana who wanted to take Sita eventhough Sita was married to Rama. Is it Sita to be blamed becaused she was born with a beautiful face, so as Dewi Renuka, and Drupadi who are also beautiful. Did they ever ask to be born with beautiful faces? So as with other girls or women who are beautiful in this present period. Is it their fault of having beautiful faces?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the law of market (buying –selling), if a person wants to buy a thing, often the buyer show the bad side of the condition of the thing he/she wants to buy, eventhough the thing was fine. By showing the bad side of the goods, it has the aims to get lower price of the goods. There is a fear of the “buyer” of his incapability to get “the goods”; which is the cause to express disappointment in the form of excoriation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This condition can be assumed that the buyer as been `enslaved` by the goods. The same thing happened to the writer of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nītiṡȃstra Kakawin.</span><span class="font4">The writer of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nītiṡȃstra Kakawin</span><span class="font4"> was certainly a male writer</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font4"> On the other hand the writer of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nītiṡȃstra</span><span class="font4">, definitely a person who always feels fear, enslaved by a woman. Or at least he was being disappointed or broken -</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Accreditation:--</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">hearted because of a woman. If the writer was only aims at teaching a student not to get married during study period by disgracing women, it is a fallacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dewi Drupadi is a beautiful woman who was said as the cause of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bharatayuddha </span><span class="font4">war. If the story of war between siblings of Bharata and Kaurawa decendants with Pandawa viewed in more details, so it can be seen that the cause was greed from the character of Kaurawa mainly the character of Duryodhana. Duryodana was being driven by his uncle Sakuni who was willing to take over the entire Astinapura Kingdom. Moreover when Pandawa had made his own palace Amartapura, Duryodhana also wanted to take it over. In short the war of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bharatayuddha</span><span class="font4"> was not caused by Drupadi but by the greed of the character Duryodhana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Further </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Nītiṡȃstra</span><span class="font4"> states that there are three things which have malice behaviour in the world are: woman, roots and river flow. All these three things can be in good conduct if there is a lotus grows on the stone. The statement on the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Nītiṡȃstra </span><span class="font4">was firmly stated that “there will be no woman who is straight (loyal and honest)” in the entire period of the world, because it is impossible for a lotus to grow on a stone. A stone is not a media that can be used by plants to grow and live, except algae/mildew. Plants like lotus can grow only on a soft muddy earth. This statement refers to the meaning of “impossible” This opinion indicates that women as stated in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Nītiṡȃstra</span><span class="font4">, none have honest behaviour and loyalty in the entire period. Briefly, it can be assumed that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Nītiṡȃstra</span><span class="font4"> stated women have bad moral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the other part </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nītiṡȃstra</span><span class="font4"> stated that women ways of thinking were not needs to be obeyed. Men who are obeying them are disgraceful men and having miserable life. So there is an assumption which disgracing women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the statement in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Nītiṡȃstra</span><span class="font4"> above, a question appeared why the writer of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Nītiṡȃstra</span><span class="font4"> disgracing women? This type of question is only eligible to be uttered by a broken- hearted person or a person who had been hurt by a woman. Because of being hurt, the feeling of hatred occurs or even vindictive to women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Did the writer ever think that he was born from a woman? Or thinking about how hard if a woman gave birth to a baby? Did the writer of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nītiṡȃstra</span><span class="font4"> ever feel happy as a man who lived with his wife even further if they have girl and boy? If these questions ever being thought by him, or even if he ever experienced them, so the statement of disgracing women would never be expressed. If the view of the writer of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nītiṡȃstra</span><span class="font4"> is right, it means there will be never existed the couple who can stay together in their lifetime. It is not necessary to employ female, police woman, female army, or even to elect a female leader, because</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Accreditation:--</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">woman are immoral.These statement certainly came from them” fear or being enslaved by women”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In terms of perspicacity, strength and eating, the strength of women is one eight compared to men. But the strength women in coitus are eight times stronger compared to men. This opinion is also lessapropritate. It can be accepted that the strength of women is far less than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In coitus probably it is true that the strength women eight times stronger compared to men. But in terms of intelligence and eating are not the same. It means that the intelligence of women and men are equal. There are women who are strong in eating, but there some who are less strong in eating. Men are also in the same condition. In terms of intelligence between men and women are also alike. It means thereare men and women who are intelligence. There are less intelligence women and men. This condition is natural, which is often called as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">rwabineda</span><span class="font4">. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rwabineda</span><span class="font4"> means “two things being apposed”, i.e: high-low, bigsmall, good-bad, clever- stupid, etc. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a fallacy to say that the intelligence of men is eight times more compared to women. In reality these can be verified from the result of examination on school children in this recent period, infact that the higestranks of passing grade wereachived by female students, either in Junior High School or Senior High School. Besides, in this present era many girls achived their undergraduate degrees, Master and Ph.D. There are women who have high position in government as a Minister, Prime Minister, even as a President of a state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In choosing a woman to be a wife, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nîtiṡậstra</span><span class="font4"> stated it with over exaggeratedmanner. If it is being implied in this era, certainly there will be many men and women who will not find their partners or become “spinster”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nîtiṡậstra</span><span class="font4"> stated in choosing a woman to be a wife, it should a woman who does not have loud voice (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">gora</span><span class="font4">). A woman who doen`t have loud voice means a woman who speaks sofly, not arrogant, etc. The woman should have </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">gemuhing</span><span class="font4"> breasts which means has big breasts. A woman, who has “big breasts”, certainly is a fertile woman, because big breasts content a lot milk for breast feeding. A lot of milk in the breast feeding will influence her fertility and the health of the child. A woman wih “big breasts” probably has symbolic meaning which is implied to a woman who is clever at earning income to support the family mainly her children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Besides the criteria above, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nîtiṡậstra</span><span class="font4"> also suggests in choosing a woman to be a wife, it is suggested not to choose handicapped, immoral and a woman from a disgraced family. But the limit of women who are from a disgraced discendants was not being expalained in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kakawin</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Nītiṡȃstra</span><span class="font4"> if it is being analysed by applying the theory of literay deconstruction, particularly on the view of women/feminine is less appropriate. The meaning content in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kakawin Nītiṡȃstra</span><span class="font4"> is negative i.e: by disgracing and humiliating women. But, if it is being closely analyzed there is an unrevealed meaning. The implied meaning refers to the fear of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nītiṡȃstra`s</span><span class="font4"> writer toward the existence of a woman. This is due to that the writer was not able to get a beautiful wife so that he buries his disappointment, broken heart, angry, and hatred. These feelings were expressed through his writing by disgracing and humiliating women.This condition can be said that the writer “being enslaved” or at least there is fear and obedience towards the existence of women.</span></p>
