<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Impatiens balsamina</span><span class="font2"> L. is a plant that is widely cultivated in Bali. The flower of this plant is used as a component of offering in Hindu religious ceremonies</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font2">The flower petals are thin and wilt easily, therefore genetic modification is needed to get better quality. This research aimed to study the effect of 0.01% colchicine with soaking periods of 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours to seedlings of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I. balsamina</span><span class="font2">. Seeds of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I. balsamina</span><span class="font2"> were germinated and sprouted seeds were treated with 0.01% colchicine for 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours. The sprouted seeds were then transfer to polybag with soil media. The experiment was designed with randomized blok design with five replicates. Observations were done on plant height, length and width of leaf, stem diameter, number of stomata as well as observation on plant stem cortex cells. Results showed that colchicine reduced plant height at three weeks after planting, while plant stem diameter increased. Control plants had the smallest leaf length and width. The number of stomata decreased at plants derived from colchicine treated sprouted seeds and the lowest stomatal number observed was at soaking duration of 24 hours.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION<sup>1</sup></span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Impatiens balsamina</span><span class="font2"> is a plant whose flowers are used as ceremonial material by the Hindu community in Bali. The colour of the flowers varies greatly but is very thin and wilt quickly. Therefore, genetic improvement of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I. balsamina</span><span class="font2"> is necessary to improve flower quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Genetic improvement can be done conventionally or non-conventionally. Conventional way is done by artificial crossing or artificial pollination. The results of crossing are expected to bring superior traits. Non-conventional genetic improvement is done by mutant selection, somatic hybridization and gene transfer [1].</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One way to improve genetic of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I. balsamina</span><span class="font2"> is by inducing polyploid. Polyploid plants are plants that have three or more sets of chromosomes in their cells [2]. The morphological characteristic of polyploid plants is bigger plants including bigger plant parts such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruit [3]</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Polyploid plants can be induced by various chemical compounds, one of which is colchicine. Colchicine is a toxic alkaloid extracted from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Colchinum autumnale </span><span class="font2">plant. Colchicine is a mitotic inhibitor. It acts by preventing tubulin polymerization, so the separation of chromosome sets is disrupted when mitosis and cells have multiplied chromosomes [4,5].</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Induction of polyploid plants with colchicine has been widely carried out. In 'Sumenep' onion, the soaking period and colchicine concentration affected the effectiveness of polyploid induction. Colchicine caused shorter onion plants, reduced the number of leaves but the leaves became thicker, reduced the amount of stomata but there was an enlargement of stomata [6].</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Polyploid of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Phalaenopsis amabilis</span><span class="font2"> seedlings can be produced by dripping colchicine 1000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (0.1%, 0.3%, 0.4% and 0.5%). It was found that the most effective colchicine concentration was 5000 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (0.5%). Polyploid </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">P. amabilis</span><span class="font2"> seedlings had larger stomata size than diploid seeds, and lower stomata density [7].</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This research aimed to evaluate various soaking periods of colchicine 0.01% to induced morphological changes in seedlings of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I. balsamina</span><span class="font2">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESEARCH METHODS</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Plant Materials</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Seeds of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I. balsamina</span><span class="font2"> were harvested from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I. balsamina</span><span class="font2"> plantation di Sading Village, Badung Regency, Bali, Indonesia. The viability of the seeds was tested by soaking seeds in water and floating seeds were discarded while sinking seeds were treated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Colchicine Treatment</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Seeds were germinated on three layers of filter paper in petri dish. When the radicle grew 1 cm long, the colchicine treatments were started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The germinated seeds were placed between layers of filter paper saturated with 0.01% colchicine for 4 hours, 8 hours and 12 hours. After colchicine treatments, the sprouts were washed with running water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Planting, Data Collection and Analysis</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The experimental design was randomised block design with five replicates. Sprouted seeds were planted in soil media in polybag. Control plants were plants without colchicine treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The parameters measured were plant height, stem diameter, the length and width of leaf and the number of stomata. The cross section of stem between treatments were also compared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The measurement of stem diameter was done by measuring the circumference of a plant stem using thread, then the length of thread was measure using ruler. The diameter of stem was calculated from stem circumference. The observations were conducted three weeks after planting. The data were analysed using ANOVA.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Plant height at three weeks after planting was showed in Fig. 1. Control plant had the highest plant height (16.12 cm), followed by plants derived from sprouted seeds treated with colchicine for 8 hours, 12 hours and 4 hours with height of 15.54 cm, 15.84 cm, and 15.68 cm respectively. The plant height among these treatments did not significantly different. Plants from sprouted seeds treated with colchicine for 24 hours had the lowest plant height (11.82 cm).</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/53950-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:228pt;height:158pt;">

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Discussion</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The highest value on plant height was obtained in the control plant. In the colchicine immersion treatment for 24 hours, sprouted seeds grew at the latest. At treatments of soaking for 4 hours, 8 hours and 12 hours, the sprouted seeds were able to grow equal to the control plants. The treatment of colchicine for 24 hours, resulting in inhibition of plant height due to decreased of cell division and cell elongation. The auxin produced by meristematic cells decreased due to the effect of inhibiting cell division by colchicine [8, 9]. Treatment of colchicine in a long time resulted in inhibition of growth rates in plant height due to disruption of the mitosis and tissue damage. This results in plants taking longer to grow [10].</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Leaf length and width increased due to colchicine treatment at three weeks after planting. The results of this study are in accordance with other research such as at (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Polianthes tuberose</span><span class="font2">), colchicine concentration of 100 ppm (0.01%) with 9 hours soaking time and concentration level of 300 ppm (0.03%) with 6 hours soaking time increased the average leaf area [11]. Research on ginger (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zingiber officinale</span><span class="font2">) also found that plants with colchicine treatments had broad, long and denser leaves compared to plants without colchicine treatment [12].</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Treatment with colchicine to sprouted seeds resulted in bigger plant stem than control plants. Plant stem cortex cells also appear larger in plants treated with colchicine. Study on chrysanthemum plants found that soaking chrysanthemum rooted cutting plants with colchicine 0.01% for 12 hours and 14 hours increased the diameter of the stem [13].</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The number of stomata decreased in plant originated from sprouted seed treated with colchicine. The decrease in the number of stomata increases with increasing immersion time. This indicates that there was a polyploidization process. Besides chromosome counting, it was reported that the decreased of stomatal number can be used to determine polyploidy levels [14]. In marigold, treatment with 0.01% increased stomatal size and decreased stomatal number per unit area [15].</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSION</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Soaking sprouted seeds with 0.01% conchicine for 24 hours resulted in lower plant height compared to control and other treatments. Soaking for 8 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours increased leaf length and width. Number of stomata decreased in all treatment.</span></p>
