<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nowdays, advertisement has become part of our lives. Either conscious or unconscious, it turns into one of the communication tools, which influences our attitudes towards products, brand names, companies, lifestyles, or even public issues. Advertisements include text, audio, video, photography and graphic designs. We will easily find advertisement through some common mediums namely newspaper, magazine, radio, television, internet, billboards, and many other places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Advertising is intended to persuade audiences, readers, viewers or listeners to take action on products, services and ideas. The idea is to drive consumer behavior in a particular way in regard to a product, service or concept. Advertising soon became an industry into itself when newspapers and magazines started allowing paid ads to be placed in their publications. This allowed specialists to make a living designing and implementing advertising as opposed to manufacturing products themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Oxford dictionaries, advertisement is a notice or announcement in a public medium promoting a product, service, or event or publicizing a job vacancy. According to Bovee (in Flinger, 1996) Advertising is the nonperson communication of information usually paid for and usually persuasive in nature about products, services or ideas by identified sponsors through the various media.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Bussinessdictionary.com there are two kind of advertisement base on the purpose. The first one is commercial advertisement. Commercial advertisement used by company to build the image of the product and it’s self.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The second one is Non-commercial advertisement which is purpose to educate consumers or promote specific ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The analysis of this article is limited to the following problems: 1) What are the structural composition (textual) of JEMME? 2) What are the meaning and message (contextual) that want to be delivered?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">II MATERIALS AND METHODS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.1 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Advertisement Structure and Analysis Technique</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">A good advertisement should attaractive and persuasive. According to Leech (1966:59) advertisement consists of several parts such as:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headline is the head of advertisement which will be the first to be read (eye catcher/attention getter)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illustration is the background of an advertisement that illustrate the advertisement</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Body Copy is the content of an advertisement and also the messages of its.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signature line (Logo) is the product view in an advertisement includes the price, slogan, or trade mark.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing details is the closing of an advertisement which can be found in the bottom of advertisement. The function of standing details is to give additional information related to the product, company, customer service, etc. Mostly standing details use small font and was not flashy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">In term of structure’s combination of the advertisement, Mulyawan (2010: 10) states that there are 8 structure combinations in advertisement, they are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headline dan signature line;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headline, signature line dan standing details;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illustration, headline dan signature line;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illustration, headline, signature line dan standing details;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headline, body copy dan signature line;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headline, body copy, signature line dan standing details;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illustration, headline, body copy dan signature line;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illustration, headline, body copy, siganture line dan standings details.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">According to Dyer (1982), analysis of advertisement classified into two, they are textual analysis and non-textual analysis</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Textual analysis in advertisement is an analysis of advertisement without any involve from circumstances surrounding. The analysis will be done base on the verbal element and non verbal element. Verbal is the intrinsic element of the advertisement. Non-verbal elements include symbol, icon, and index.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icon is a sign about the reality situation such as picture</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index is a sign that show the features or characteristic</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(iii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symbol is a sign that represented the object based on the agreement.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contextual analysis in advertisement is analysis in advertisement to find the message that will be delivered from the advertisers to the consumers. In this part the analysis involve the advertisers or consumers of the advertisement.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.2 &nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Semiotics and Hypersemiotics</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Semiotics is a study of sign including the role in social life. Sign itself is a stimulus which is received by people brain to be processed then elicits a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">response about a particular of realistic concept. Therefore semiotics study learns all forms of relation between sign with representation of reality and between the users in the social life of the community. The relation between sign with the representation of reality is known as relation between signifier (sign) and signified (meaning).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Related to signifier and signified, there are many theories put forward by linguists with various terms and expression. This study applies two theories of semiotics which is triggered by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ferdinand de Saussure and Ogden &amp;&nbsp;Rhicards</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ferdinand de Saussure</span><span class="font5"> (Saussure, url: pg. 2-3) explained that language is a system of communication which involves concept and sound image, where sound image is a signifier and concept is signified. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saussure</span><span class="font5"> stated further:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">… The bond between the signifier and signified is arbitrary, there is nothing in either the thing or the word that makes the two together, no natural, intrinsic, or logical relation between a particular sound image and a concept;…</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Between signifier and signified does not have correlation or a relationship. Signifier is something which is arbitrary or having nothing to do with the signifier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, Ogden &amp;&nbsp;Richards (1923) add a communicator element between signifier and signified that is thought of reference. The relation between them was described in the picture as known as semiotics triangle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The stimulus of signifier in this part is known as a linguistics element of word or sentence then processed in the brain through the concept of meaning that has been owned over the signifier then produces a respond in form of referent as a signified. Therefore, between signifier and signified does not have a direct relation but associated through the concept of meaning in the brain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In contrast to semiotics, Hypersemiotics is a study which studies the relation between hyper-sign with its representation which beyond the limits of reality (hyper-reality). Piliang (2003:54) said that the world of hyper-reality is unreality world by using the signs which beyond the limits so that the signs can only be explained in hyper-reality world and has lost touch with its reality representation. Thus it can be said that hyper-reality world is a human imagination world with the various sign which are imaginary and free in meaning and separated from reality contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Piliang (2003 : 54) explain that the sign which exceed the limit when it has been out of the limit of principles, characters, nature, and the normal function of sign as a communication device and the delivery of information, also already lost contact with its reality representative. Further, Piliang (2003: 54-59) provide the limit of type of sign wich can be a study of hypersemiotics, as follow:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2.2.1</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper Sign</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Proper sign is a sign which has relatively symmetrical relation with concept or reality which represents. For example rose signifier is used as love signified which represent love in social life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2.2.2</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pseudo Sign</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Pseudo sign is a sign which is not genuine, imitation, pretend, fake sign in which such reality reduction takes place. In this part a signifier shown only partially for represent a complex reality.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2.2.3</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False Sign</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">False sign is a sign which is used for cover a reality with another reality represent. In this case a sign with different reality is used to represent another reality which have no any relation at all.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2.2.4</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recycle Sign</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">This sign is reality representation sign in a different context of space and time and used foe represent the other reality. For example the using of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Marsinah</span><span class="font5"> picture signifier (in the past) to represents the rape incidence of Chinese ethnic women in May 13th riots in Jakarta. This could be happened because of the possibility of the tragedy has no footage of the incident, only the recognition of victims.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2.2.5</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artificial Sign</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Artificial sign also known as unnatural sign is a sign which made by advanced technology (digital or computer technology) and have no reference in reality. Artificial creation is not used to represent something outside the sign itself, but represent the sign itself. For example the caricature of the main character in anime movie, where all signifier is made for represent the reality in the movie without put any reference in reality.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2.2.6</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superlative sign</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Superlative sign is a sign which is made for represent a simple signified in reality, but the truth appears in special signified that involves many additional effects (audio and visual) so it give rise to the extreme expression (hyperbolic) out of the limit of reality representation.</span></p>
