<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The role of agriculture as the leading sector in boosting food security is a benchmark for a country, especially a developing country like Indonesia, which is highly dependent on several sectors, one of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">which is the agricultural sector, apart from supporting food security; the agricultural sector can also be used as a tourist attraction. The tourism industry also has an important role in the growth and development of an area, even in some tourism areas, for example Bali. Bali tourism is one of the leading sectors besides</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the agricultural sector. The natural beauty, culture, hospitality of the Balinese people, and their customs make Bali a world favorite destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The tourism trend with the back to nature concept encourages the development of alternative tourism models or special interest tourism that prioritizes natural conservation values and interacts with local communities that are beneficial to tourists and provide opportunities for local communities and farmers to enjoy the benefits of developing agriculture-based tourism. The trend back to nature can provide benefit for local communities from nature-based tourism activities known as nature-based tourism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The alternative forms of tourism developed in Bali include agro-tourism activities, spiritual tourism, village tours, and ecotourism. Agro-tourism is a tourism activity that pays great attention to the agricultural and plantation sectors, such as in Ceking Village. One of the attractions of Agro tourism in Ceking Village Rice Field Terrace is the natural panorama of terraced rice fields, which are more commonly known as rice terraces which are included as a heritage that needs to be preserved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of tourist arrivals to Ceking Rice Field Terrace Agrotourism after the eruption of Mount Agung decreased drastically so it is necessary to create a destination image (brand </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font3">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Respondent Characteristics</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The majority of respondents who visited Ceking Rice Field Terrace Agrotourism were male. Most respondents came from the UK and the least came from Italy. The highest age range of respondents was 21-30 years and the lowest was less than 20 years. The occupations of visitor respondents were varied, from entrepreneur to police / army officer. The majority of respondents knew information about Ceking Rice Field Terrace from the internet and rarely received information from radio or television advertisements. Respondents visited more with friends than with groups. On average, respondents have visited the Ceking Rice Field Terrace Agro tourism more than 3 times.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Confirmatory Analysis</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Confirmatory analysis in this study is shown to draw inferences about the influence of brand awareness, brand image, brand association on satisfaction, and revisit intention of foreign tourists at Ceking Rice Field Terrace Agro Tourism. The influence of brand awareness, brand image and brand association on the satisfaction and revisit intention of foreign tourists at Ceking Rice Field Terrace Agrotourism is modeled through a structural equation model (SEM) by involving five</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">latent variables as previously explained. The SEM model developed in this study is variance-based SEM with a model structure as shown in Figure 1 below.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/64595-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:215pt;height:179pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Outer/measurement Model</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The analysis on the outer measurement model focuses on examining the relationship between latent variables and their indicators. The indicator can be</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">seen from the outer-loading. Testing for discriminant validity is by looking at the Average Variance Extraxted (AVE) value in the PLS model. The model requirement has good validity if each latent variable has (AVE) above 0.5. In this study, the AVE value is presented in Table 1 below.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Based on table 6, the SRMR (Standardized Root Mean Residual) value of 0.089 indicates that the model is said to be feasible.

<p><span class="font4">Based on the results of research on brand awareness, brand image and brand association have a positive influence on the satisfaction of foreign tourists and revisit intention at Ceking Rice Field Terrace, implications can be made which hopefully can be used as input for local governments to increase destination brands on Ceking Rice Field Terrace Agro tourism as the main choice when visiting Bali. The discussion is as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brand association variable</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Brand awareness has a significant positive effect on the satisfaction of foreign tourists, this is based on the parameter coefficient value of 0.400 which means that it reflects a latent variable on foreign tourist satisfaction by 40%, meaning that the increasing brand awareness in Ceking Rice Field Terrace will be followed by more increasing satisfaction of tourists visiting Ceking Rice Field Terrace. Ceking Rice Field Terrace's brand awareness is already good so that it affects the satisfaction of foreign tourists.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brand image variable</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Brand image has a significant positive effect on the satisfaction of foreign tourists. This is based on the value of the parameter coefficient of 0.346, which means that it reflects a latent variable on the satisfaction of foreign consumers of 34.6%, which </span><span class="font3">272 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e-ISSN: 2407-392X. p-ISSN: 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">means that the increasing brand image of Ceking Rice Field Terrace will be followed by an increase in the satisfaction of foreign tourists. This proves that the brand image, especially the beauty of the rice fields, is already good so that it affects the satisfaction of foreign tourists and their future revisit intention.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brand association variable</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Brand association has a significant positive effect on the satisfaction of foreign tourists. This is based on the value of the parameter coefficient of 0.336 which means that it reflects a latent variable on the satisfaction of foreign tourists by 33.6%, which means that the increasing of the Ceking Rice Field Terrace brand association will be followed by an increase in the satisfaction of foreign tourists. This proves that the brand association is good so that it affects the satisfaction of foreign tourists.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variable of satisfaction of foreign tourists</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The satisfaction of foreign tourists has a positive influence on revisit intention. This is based on the parameter coefficient value of 0.605 which means that it reflects a latent variable on revisit intention of 60.5%, which means that the more satisfied tourists are with Ceking Rice Field Terrace Agrotourism, the higher the revisit intention rate will be. The satisfaction of foreign tourists</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">has proven that it has an influence on revisit intention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The obstacles faced in building a destination brand on Ceking Rice Field Terrace Agro-tourism are the fact that the Ceking area has not been widely known as a tourist destination. Foreign tourists are more familiar with Ceking by the name Tegalalang, so a more intense promotion is needed in introducing the name Ceking as a tourist destination in Gianyar. In other words, it is lack of promotion of the name Ceking Rice Field Terrace by the local community to visiting foreign tourists. Another obstacle is the unavailability of handicrafts that have the characteristics of Ceking Rice Field Terrace Agro-tourism</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
