<p><span class="font1">Betawi has a diversity of traditional food. One of the diversity of traditional foods of Betawi’s type of cake is Sengkulun cake. This rare cake is made from glutinous rice flour. Study was designed to recognize the Sengkulun cake from history, culture and philosophy as well as documenting the original way of making the cake which has begun to be forgotten. Descriptive qualitative approach was used to analyse data and information. Respondent were elders, i.e. Betawi cultural experts and Sengkulun cake makers. Experiment was conducted to obtain documentation in the form of photo and video which could make the cake more interesting to become Betawi ‘s snacks. Results show that the Sengkulun cake has existed for a long time but cannot be known with certainty the year of the creation of this cake. This cake began to be created because of the abundant availability of glutinous rice and also due to the influence of Chinese ethnic in the processing the snacks. The cake has a high position in ancient times because this cake can only be found in certain events such as Eid al-Fitr. From the Sengkulun's philosophy, it can be said that sticky texture of the Sengkulun cake has a symbol of respect each other.</span></p></td></tr>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Introduction</span><br><br><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Background</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Jakarta is a city that has many functions and roles. Jakarta as the capital of the province and also the state capital. the hustle of routine as the center of government, the trading city, the administrative center, the central political activity, and the educational center, as if ceaselessly offering modernity, which almost eliminates the identity of Jakarta. Jakarta is unique because it cannot</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">simply represent the ethnic population of the original, namely Betawi, but also home to various humans, tribes, cultures, and other ethnic who come, live, and thrive in it. The epistemology of Jakarta culture is a mixed culture or culture of various ethnicities. Since the Dutch era, Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia which attracts migrants from within and outside the archipelago. The tribes inhabiting Jakarta, among others, Java, Sunda, Minang, Batak, and Bugis (Martiah, 2013). Apart from the population of the archipelago,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jakarta culture is also absorbed from many foreign cultures, such as Arabic, Chinese, Indian and Portuguese. With cultural diversity that ultimately mutually acculturates affect traditional culinary products contained in Jakarta. Cultural assimilation was inevitable, especially since the first city of Jakarta has become a melting pot. Various local and foreign ethnic crowded the city of Jakarta. Status as a modern city with a massive wave of development invasion also played a role to wipe out the existence of ethnic Betawi, the original inhabitants of Jakarta who deserved the presence of the newcomers (Lila, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Before the 1960s in the center of Jakarta there were many Betawi settlements, but due to the development and industrialization, many Betawi Kota people moved to the outskirts of Jakarta (Shabab, 2004). Land owned by Betawi people more and more are traded freely. The city of Jakarta was later abandoned the original inhabitants, changed with the immigrants who race to taste the beautiful metropolitan. Under the guise of globalization, traditional Betawi wisdom is increasingly felt strange in his own village. In addition to its predicate as a metropolitan city, other tourist attraction is said to have come from a number of art and cultural festivals held in Jakarta (Deny, 2014). Therefore, in addition to offering the splendor of a sparkling urban city with luxurious facilities, Jakarta should also more often showcase the uniqueness of Betawi ethnic culture, including culinary, which is loaded with historical value and philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As one of the tourist destinations in Indonesia, quite a lot of Jakarta's local culture can be developed and promoted, including culinary riches. There are a line of delicious and unique dishes that are very potent Betawi so the appeal of the culinary tourist, either because of taste, health benefits, or the value of philosophy and history that accompany it. Unfortunately until now the Betawi culinary wealth has not become a reason for tourists to come to Jakarta. Betawi culinary tour in Jakarta is still not well known, still far behind the popularity of shopping center and family recreation center. In the official website of Jakarta Tourism and Culture Department, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">choice of Betawi restaurant or restaurant is not in the recommended Indonesian food reference (Lila, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Betawi typical food as its culture is a blend of elements from outside such as culinary from China, Middle East and the Netherlands. The cuisine of these elements can be recognized in the typical Betawi cuisine, but there are some dishes that are purely derived from outside but in the spread of the food undergoes a name change. Betawi has a diversity of artistry such as music, dance, tourist attractions, and food. The diversity is also influenced by other cultures, one of which is seen from the diversity of traditional Betawi food of cake that is influenced from the Chinese cultural traditions that are visible from various types of food typical of Betawi (Dwi, 2015).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the Betawi culinary that is influenced by Chinese culture is Sengkulun . But this cake is now beginning to be difficult to obtain, even practically rare. Sengkulun is a cursory look like a basket. Cake that is made from glutinous rice, has a rough nodded surface, texture is soft and chewy. Originally Sengkulun made from Java brown sugar. This traditional food began to be difficult to obtain, practically rare in fact. The causes are varied; no one can make it anymore, less favored and no popularization and no future generations. Too bad if traditional food goes extinct one by one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the background of the above problems to be able to preserve traditional Betawi food, especially Betawi cake which is increasingly difficult to obtain, while this cake is a cultural heritage that needs to be maintained, especially in the effort to preserve the culinary of the archipelago as a part of national tourism development, proposed a research topic on Betawi Culinary Cake as Betawi traditional culinary.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Reseach Objectives</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">This study only reviewed the Sengkulun cake in terms of Philosophy, History and Culture, looks at how the original way of making Sengkulun cakes to be able to be documented and develops Sengkulun product to be more acceptable by society. the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">purpose of the research is to know the history, philosophy and culture of Betawi Sengkulun cake and to preserve the Betawi Sengkulun cake. Research Benefits are providing information in the form of valid documents as a Betawi traditional culinary reference, Introducing Sengkulun cake as traditional Betawi snack and preserving Sengkulun cake to be known by the community.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Literature Review</span><br><br><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>History</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">History is chronological study that interpret and gives meaning to events and applies systematic methods to discover the truth. History is continuous process of interaction between the historian and his fact, unending dialogue between the present and the past (Carl, 1985). Every historian would agree, I think that history is kind of research or inquiry.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Philosophy</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Philosophy is an attitude toward life and universe; philosophy is a method of reflective thinking and reasoned inquiry ; philosophy is a group of problem; philosophy is a group of system thought (Harold, 2015).</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Culture</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">According to structuralism, contains the basic idea as follows. Structuralism views that all societies and cultures have the same and fixed structure. This belief believes that every human being possesses a genetically inherited basic ability that this ability exists in every normal human being. This understanding places the structure of Language and culture as forces and even human consciousness. In this case, ceremonies, systems, kinship, marriage, cooking dress are the pattern of Language. Cultures such as Languages in which there are hidden rules governing the behavior of society. This hidden rule is what makes a community group unique and different from other community groups.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>History of Betawi</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Betawi tribe is a tribe in Indonesia whose inhabitants generally reside in Jakarta. Some argue that the Betawi tribe is derived from inter-ethnic and inter-mawin marriages in the past. Biologically, those who claim to be Betawi people are descendants of bloody mix of various tribes and nations imported by the Dutch to Batavia. The so-called Betawi people or tribes actually counted newcomers in Jakarta. This ethnic group was born from a combination of various other ethnic groups who already live in Jakarta, such as Sundanese, Javanese, Arabic, Balinese, Bugis, Makassar, Ambon, Malay and Chinese (Murni, 2012).</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Cooking Method</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Traditional food cooked with certain cooking methods or techniques to produce different textures and food products. Some cooking techniques with water convection is steaming, The cooking process is moist or wet, with heat from steam or with steamed terms. In this Sengkulun cake research is cooked in a way steamed.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>The Cake Sengkulun</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">According to Indra Ketaren in Upa Boga Indonesia, typical food from Betawi which is cursory like a basket cake but the surface is rough. A sweet savory sweet flavor with a supple and soft texture. Sengkulun is made with the main raw material of sticky rice flour. The color of chocolate Because it uses brown sugar as well as a sweetener in addition to using sugar as well. While that makes it tasty, no other thick coconut milk. Steam time long enough, about 2 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This food is not really pure Betawi, but there is the influence of Chinese culture. Admittedly, Chinese culture is strong enough to penetrate the Betawi culture. On Idul Fitri and Idul Adha, usually Kue Sengkulun is often served. Cake with basic ingredients sago and glutinous flour is very tasty in combination with grated coconut. The area of this cake distribution is cultivated in certain areas on the border area of east and south Jakarta (Murni, 2012; Felicia, 2014).</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Methodology</span><br><br><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Design and Time</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Methods are a way of expressing objective truth. This method is intended to reveal that the expressed truth is based on sound scientific evidence. Therefore, methods can also be interpreted as procedures or sequences of ways that systematically extract scientific truths (Firta, 2015). This research uses descriptive method with qualitative approach. Qualitative approach is a research process that produces descriptive data in the form of oral words of people and behavior observed (Bogdan and Taylor, 1992). Qualitative approach was chosen in this study to see the essence of research so that the results obtained detailed. Qualitative research has the following characteristics.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a natural research background and researchers act as this instrument. Researchers are mostly at the research site to observe and understand the problem in depth. Researchers also use a tape recorder to document data in words and cameras to document in the form of images.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descriptive nature, the researchers will describe the problem of research with the detailed data collection and complete.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More emphasis on process than product. The process is more emphasized because research begins with &quot;how&quot; and not &quot;what&quot;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tend to analyze data inductively. The research begins with a way of looking at the specific circumstances in society and then drawn general conclusions based on the development of ideas from existing theories.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In qualitative research, which is very important. This approach emphasizes the importance of fast and accurate capture of post-insights.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">This type of research uses a descriptive approach, i.e., a study that aims to provide or describe a state or phenomenon that occurs today by using scientific procedures to answer the problem in actual (Sugiyono, 2010). Descriptive research tries to find the right and sufficient description of all activities, objects, processes and people (Basuki and Sulistyo, 2010). The method used in the study was</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">descriptive and qualitative by in-depth interview with snowball technique and observation. Observations carried out to see how to make Sengkulun cake. The study was conducted from April to August 2017 in Jakarta especially at central Jakarta.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Sources of data</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Data was collected using snowball sampling technique. According Sugiyono (2010:85) &quot;snowball sampling is a technique of determining samples at first small amount then become big&quot;. If the data collection of the first respondent has been completed, the researcher requests that the respondent provide a second and further recommendation. This process lasts until the researchers obtain sufficient data and as needed.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Data collection technique</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Data collection is a very important step in the research, a researcher must be skilled in collecting data in order to obtain valid data. Data collection is a systematic and standard procedure for obtaining necessary data. In qualitative research the techniques used are observation (observation), in-depth interview, and documentation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In Qualitative Research, the observation is clarified into 3 ways: observers can act as participants or nonparticipants, observation can be done frankly or disguise, and observation concerning the research background (Sugiyono, 2010) and in this research used observation technique which where researcher act as participants Observations conducted by the author in this study is the observation frankly, in this</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In the technique of gathering using interviews is almost the same as the questionnaire. The interview itself was divided into 3 groups: structured interviews, semi-structured interviews, and in-depth interviews. Researchers chose to conduct in-depth interviews, aiming to collect complex information, most of which contain opinions, attitudes, and personal experiences (Basuki and Sulistyo, 2010). To avoid losing information, the researcher asks the resource person to use the tape recorder. Before an in-depth interview, the researcher explains or gives a brief and clear overview of the topic of research.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documentation</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The document according to Sugiyono (2010: 240) is a record of events that have passed. Documents used by researchers here in the form of photographs, images, and data about the Sengkulun cake. The results of the observations and interviews will be more legitimate and reliable if supported by photographs.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Data Analysis</span></h1>

<p><span class="font1">The origin of Sengkulun is estimated to begin to be made from the availability or harvest of glutinous rice is abundant. The influence of immigrants from ethnic Malays and Chinese such as making basket cake, the Betawi residents allegedly adopted the way of making Sengkulun by using glutinous rice that is easily obtained at that time. At least references related to Betawi traditional cake caused the history of Sengkulun become limited. From the results of extracting</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">information from the sources, only a small number of informants who have the belief and the opinion that Sengkulun is a Betawi traditional cake made without any influence from other cultures. But most of the informants argue that because Betawi past is a gathering place of various ethnicities and nations, it is suspected of strong ethnic Chinese influence that inspires the making of this Sengkulun.

But this cake has long been known as a snack and is an offering cake for the elderly or magnifying people in the past. This cake has a position that is considered high in the past, because only made and intended to people who are respected or have a high position in the community. It is also reinforced by the making of cakes that are only performed at large ceremonies on the feast of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Table 4 shows how is the position of Sengkulun in today's Betawi society?</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Suggestion</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Indonesian culture is so much we should be proud and appreciate our culture. It should be the younger generation can civilize and preserve indigenous culture of Indonesia and do not just imitate foreign culture. Generally, Indonesian people are more proud of foreign cultures that put forward a more luxurious and stylish culture but forget the original culture. Therefore, it is necessary to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">recognize the indigenous culture of Indonesia. Suggestion for Sengkulun that is expected to be done further research that lift Sengkulun with modification of more unique flavor again to Sengkulun can be Betawi snack which have many flavor choice.</span></p>
