<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">The business environment changing is very dynamic with high competition in the globalization era. Every business must be able to maintain the competitiveness sustainability of its business through innovation. According to Castaneda &amp;&nbsp;Cuellar (2020), innovation is the business success's key and a way for businesses to maintain business sustainability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The creative industry is concerned with the utilization and creation of individual creativity and talent. The utilization of this talent can produce creative work (Husin et al., 2021). There is also the critical role of creative industries, such as growing and developing the </span><span class="font5">87</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">country's economics. The creative industry makes a significant contribution to the absorption of 16 million workers. This industry contributes to Gross Domestic Product of 7.55% or 1.211 trillion, which is 7% higher than in 2018 (Bureau of Indonesia’ Creative Economy, 2019). Although the creative industry has a significant role in the country's economic growth, the production of the creative industry is still not accepted in the global market. So thus, it indicates that the problem faced by the creative industry is that the innovation ability of employees is still relatively low. According to Sari et al. (2020), an internal factor to increase the creative industry's competitiveness is the business's ability to innovate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The creative industry relies on the ability of human resources as the primary source in generating competitiveness. Organizations must manage their human resources to maximize their potential. Management of the potential knowledge and skills of employees requires an element of trust in the organization. The creative industry has a work structure that allows employees to improve their skills. The small number of employees and the simple organizational structure allow employees to work together (Ayyagari, 2006). Organizations need to grow to sustain the ability of employees to innovate in the creative industries (Berraies et al., 2014). Trust from the leaders and coworkers can encourage employees to take more initiative in their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Interpersonal trust is the belief and trust of individuals to act based on their actions and decisions to others (McAllister, 1995). Li &amp;&nbsp;Betts (2011) stated that the influential tool in business management is trust. In addition, trust sharpens the organization performance through innovation. According to Davenport &amp;&nbsp;Prusak (1998), trust also allows companies to use knowledge resources better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The trust concept in the organizations' environments has evolved in the current years as a research outcome as the recent way for encouraging the collaboration between employees and team within a business. This concept introduces a more participatory management model (Mayer et al., 1995). In addition, trust is a willingness to believe others, and it is indicated by how much trust a person has in that person. Trust also helps the knowledge sharing flow which is necessary to sustain creativity and innovative services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This study is based on various research gaps from previous researchers. The organization has the benefit from a higher level of trust among the employees. Based on the previous research results that interpersonal trust among employees has a positive relationship with job satisfaction (Guinot et al., 2014); (Safari et al. (2020); organizational commitment (Curado &amp;&nbsp;Vieira, 2019), and task performance (Kim et al., 2018). On the other hand, interpersonal trust is negatively impacted by stress at work (Guinot et al., 2014). Furthermore, the previous research also showed that trust positively significant affects knowledge sharing in the workplace (Rutten et al., 2016; Nerstad et al., 2018; Ouakouak &amp;&nbsp;Ouedraogo, 2019). On the other hand, different research outcomes were done by Bakker et al. (2006) and (Chow &amp;&nbsp;Chan, 2008). Based on Trivellas et al. (2015) and Guinot et al. (2014), interpersonal trust affected job satisfaction. The previous findings still found inconsistent results. The difference in the study results by Leat &amp;&nbsp;El-Kot (2009) explains that interpersonal trust does not affect job satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Social exchange theory stated that interpersonal trust among coworkers would lead to the employee's more robust sense of security in the workplace (Erkutlu &amp;&nbsp;Chafra, 2015). There are a practical basis and a cognitive basis in interpersonal trust. Rational decisions for trusting another party will involve the cognitive basis of trust. These decisions are according to the qualities, such as responsibility, competence, dependability, and test the trust of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Cognitive-based trust indicates the belief that the other party is reliable, dependable, competent, and responsible. However, influence-based beliefs are based on the emotional</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">connection between individuals. Trust is very potential to influence the organization's knowledge. A level of trust must be established to enable knowledge sharing for enhancing employee sharing capabilities. Knowledge sharing will lead the employees' experiences and skills exchange, contribute to collective learning, and generate reflection on current knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Individual learning and development have an essential role for the organization due to knowledge sharing as the critical element of knowledge management. Knowledge sharing involves donating, collecting information, and spreading experience and knowledge (Mirzaee &amp;&nbsp;Ghaffari, 2018). Knowledge sharing will occur if the knowledgeable employees support their coworkers to develop new skills and experiences. Knowledge sharing will transfer the organizational resources and assets knowledge to the employees. So that, the process enables organizations in the highly competitive economy to achieve the goal of a sustainable competitive advantage (Wang &amp;&nbsp;Noe, 2010). Therefore, organizations should encourage shared learning experiences, communication, and a culture of knowledge sharing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition, job satisfaction states someone's attitude about their job. The concept of job satisfaction shows the emotional state of an employee's job appraisal that comes from evaluating its characteristics. Previous researches confirmed a positive relationship between trust and knowledge sharing (Hsu &amp;&nbsp;Chang, 2012; Eze et al., 2013) and knowledge sharing on job satisfaction (Trivellas et al., 2015: The &amp;&nbsp;Sun, 2012). However, there were also previous researches on the relationship between trust and job satisfaction that did not consider the mediating role of knowledge-sharing behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This research proposes a conceptual model to examine and develop a better understanding of the organizations' interpersonal trust on employee job satisfaction. The study will also propose knowledge sharing as the mediating. This research was conducted on the creative industry-based SMEs in East Java. It is due to SMEs in East Java as a province has a higher creative business growth. East Java contributed the second-largest export value after West Java (Bureau of Indonesia’ Creative Economy, 2019). Thus, the main contribution of this study is to generate a more comprehensive picture of the relationship between interpersonal trust, knowledge sharing, and job satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Interpersonal trust indicates the most critical factor in encouraging an atmosphere of knowledge sharing. Heyns &amp;&nbsp;Rothmann (2015) suggested that trust was influenced by the tendency to be trusted. The more a person trusts the other person, so thus, the willingness of knowledge sharing with that person is. Trusting someone will make the transmitted knowledge used appropriately. Interpersonal trust expects reciprocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Moreover, there is a belief that the other party must be shared knowledge as well. This reciprocal expectation is confirmed in the social exchange theory and social capital theory (Hsu &amp;&nbsp;Chang, 2012). Trust impacts knowledge gathering. Knowledge recipients are less inclined to verify the knowledge accuracy and the knowledge correctness from reliable sources. Such conditions make the knowledge recipient does not need to spend the time and the effort to verify the acquired knowledge. The knowledge recipient will use it immediately so to accelerate organizational learning and organizational responsiveness. The previous empirical research confirms a positive relationship between trust and knowledge sharing (Hsu &amp;&nbsp;Chang, 2012). Thus the proposed hypothesis is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">H1: Interpersonal trust has an influence on knowledge sharing</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Knowledge-sharing behaviour is difference from attitudes. Behaviour is a natural action that results from an attitude (Teh &amp;&nbsp;Sun, 2012). Knowledge-sharing behaviour is highly dependent on a person's attitude and the willingness of someone for sharing knowledge. Willingness will reflect someone's preparation and readiness for giving others access to their</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">intellectual capital. Peer recognition and the increasing reputation will benefit people who are passionate about sharing knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Job satisfaction was affected not only by the employee's work situation objective yet also by his or her subjective perception of work (Mora &amp;&nbsp;Ferrer-i-Carbonell, 2009). Job satisfaction indicates the essential element for the employees for playing an active role when achieving the company's goals. Job satisfaction is stated as the individual's attitude about their job. Satisfied employees are more productive and dynamic than dissatisfied employees. Job satisfaction is the concept of job characteristics and a good work climate (Rutten et al., 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For decades, knowledge sharing has been associated with job satisfaction, and intra-organizational knowledge sharing is a knowledge management process that increases job satisfaction for most employees. Several previous researchers have investigated knowledge sharing and job satisfaction. Trivellas et al. (2015) reported that knowledge sharing contributes significantly to job satisfaction. The second hypothesis is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">H2: Knowledge sharing has an influence on job satisfaction</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">According to Rhee (2010), trust in one another at work was the human relations indicator among the other members at work. Trust within the organization by individuals and groups is a very important factor for the long-term organization stability and the organization member's well-being. Previous researches have shown that interpersonal trust will create more positive attitudes at work. It is including job satisfaction and commitment. When employees have high trust, they will perceive themselves as a valuable and essential team. So thus, the employees will feel more enthusiastic and happier with their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Several studies analyzing the superior-subordinate relationship also found that trust directly influences job satisfaction (Guinot et al., 2014). According to the explanation, so that the hypothesis number tree is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">H3: Interpersonal trust has an influence on job satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The previous study has shown that trust positively impact the donation and accumulation of knowledge, which facilitates the formation of job satisfaction. Knowledge sharing will play a role as the bridge connecting interpersonal trust with employee satisfaction in the workplace. There is a belief that the knowledge will be used properly and will not be used against it when someone communicates their knowledge to their colleagues. They believe that the information obtained is correct from the employee; thus they collect the knowledge from their coworker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">According to social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1977), employees share knowledge through experience, further increasing their job satisfaction. Findings from (Almahamid et al., 2010) describe that knowledge sharing will increase someone's ability and job satisfaction. Based on the previous result's study generated that knowledge sharing had a positive impact on job satisfaction (Kianto et al., 2016). Research findings from Malik &amp;&nbsp;Kanwal (2018) confirm that organizational practice of knowledge sharing plays a positive impact on job satisfaction, so thus the hypothesis for the explanation is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">H4: Knowledge sharing mediates the effect between interpersonal trust toward job satisfaction</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Research Framework</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Figure 1 shows the theoretical research framework as the following:</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/75615-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:354pt;height:112pt;">

<p><span class="font9">This research uses the quantitative method. The survey was conducted through a questionnaire. All creative industry employees in East Java are the population of this study. This creative industry includes the business fields contained in the Bureau of Indonesia’ Creative Economy grouping, for example, advertising, craft architecture, fashion, culinary, video, film and photography, art market, design interactive games, publishing and printing, computer services, and software, television and radio, performing arts, music, research and development (Bureau of Indonesia’ Creative Economy, 2019).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hair et al. (2010) explained that the number of samples is determined by using 5-10 parameters times the number of indicators. This study has 21 indicators, so that the minimum number of samples is 21 x 5 = 105. The number of samples used in this study was 168 employees to obtain accurate information from respondents. For this research, the researchers used the non-probability sampling method by using purposive sampling. The researchers have criteria of employees with a minimum service period of 1 year. In addition, each measurement will consist of questions on a five-point Likert Scale. Data was collected from the respondents was analysed using the Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) approach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The interpersonal trust research instrument was developed by Oh &amp;&nbsp;Park (2011) that using three items. For example, the variable items such as the level of trust in coworkers of the same level. Knowledge sharing variable will use 8 item statements that consist of 4 question items explaining the collecting knowledge and the donating knowledge from Akhavan et al.( 2013). For example, the knowledge gathering item statement such as coworkers share knowledge when I ask. An example of a knowledge-giving item: &quot;Sharing information with coworkers without being asked&quot;. Measurement of job satisfaction using ten items from Chung et al. (2017). Example item: &quot;The family atmosphere at work is well-developed.&quot;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Furthermore, for the substantive effect, H2 shows the most significant effect, then H3. At the same time, H1 shows the most minor effect. As shown in Table 2, the indirect effect of interpersonal trust on job satisfaction through the mediating role of knowledge sharing is supported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The direct effect of interpersonal trust on knowledge sharing has a value of 0.337 and a t-value of 4.367 which is more significant than 1.96, and a p-value (0.000) &lt;0.05. This shows that H1 is received. It states that the hypothesis statement that interpersonal trust has a significant effect on knowledge sharing is supported. The study results indicate that creative industry employees who have good interpersonal trust are willing to carry out knowledgesharing activities with colleagues. Employees are willing to share their knowledge and collect knowledge from their coworkers if they trusted them. In the creative industries, knowledge sharing will enable the employees to increase the employee's value, enhance someone competencies and skills, and also maintain the employee's competitive advantage. Interpersonal trust shows the willingness of one employee to depend on another employee with a feeling of security. Thus, it will be an essential factor for influencing knowledge-sharing decisions in organizations (Hsu &amp;&nbsp;Chang, 2012). Interpersonal trust among coworkers is an indispensable attribute to strengthen the knowledge-sharing process in an organization (AlShamsi &amp;&nbsp;Ajmal, 2018). Those research findings are consistent with the previous research outcome of Eze et al. (2013) and Mohammed &amp;&nbsp;Kamalanabhan (2019), which stated that interpersonal trust is the cause of employees sharing knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The value of the direct effect from variable knowledge sharing on job satisfaction is 0.427 and the t-value of 5.422. The t-value is more significant than 1.96 and a p-value of 0.001 &lt;0.05, so that H2 is supported. The analysis results show that the higher employee's willingness to share knowledge will make the higher the perceived job satisfaction. When the level of knowledge sharing is higher, the creative industry employees are more willing to exchange knowledge, information, and skills with other colleagues in the organization. This tendency can improve individual abilities at work which has an impact on job satisfaction. According to Almahamid et al. ( 2010), knowledge sharing can improve employee skills and job satisfaction. This statement is reinforced by socio-cognitive theory (Bandura, 1977). It stated that sharing knowledge from experienced coworkers will motivate another employee to trust for sharing their knowledge through the experiences of other employees, thereby increasing their job satisfaction. Empirical results strengthen this study, which revealed that knowledge sharing</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">positively significantly affects employee job satisfaction (Trivellas et al., 2015) and (Kianto et al., 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The direct effect of interpersonal trust on job satisfaction has a value of 0.382, and t-value of 4.581 &gt;&nbsp;1.96, and a p-value (0.000) &lt;&nbsp;0.05 so that H3 is supported. These results indicate that the interpersonal trust of creative industry employees can affect job satisfaction. There are conditions of working with respect for honesty, emotional regulation, and reliability between employees to result in satisfaction in creative industry employees. Those conditions happened when there is higher interpersonal trust possessed by the employees. Employee trust in coworkers is essential for self-development, so that it has an impact on job satisfaction. This finding confirms the previous researches of Kelly et al. (2015) and (Guinot et al., 2014), who said that with the high level of interpersonal trust felt by employees, the job satisfaction felt by employees also increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The indirect effect of knowledge sharing can mediate effect between interpersonal trust and job satisfaction based on the value of 0.687 and t-value of 3.356 &gt;&nbsp;of 1.96 and p-value (0.000) &lt;&nbsp;0.05. That value means that the role of knowledge sharing mediating interpersonal trust and job satisfaction is proven to be accepted. Thus, it can be conveyed that strong interpersonal trust can indirectly increase job satisfaction through employees' willingness to share the employee's knowledge. The results show that the direct effect of interpersonal trust on job satisfaction is significant with a value of 0.382, which is smaller than the indirect effect through the mediation of knowledge sharing with a value of 0.687. This study explains that knowledge sharing has a partial mediating role. This result is reinforced by the findings of Rotenberg (2010) that interpersonal trust is needed to build good relationships among employees, which is the basis for trusting other individuals in carrying out work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The results of this study can improve the theoretical development of the conceptual model. It can explain that there is an effect between interpersonal trust, knowledge sharing, and employee job satisfaction. In the creative industry sector, only a few studies in the literature examine the relationship of these research variables. The previous studies have become less comprehensive to support the management of employees through their job satisfaction. The more important aspects of employee job satisfaction are to avoid turnover that is detrimental to the company itself. This research built a model that combines several variables mentioned above to fill in the gaps identified in the prior literature. This study also develops hypotheses regarding the direct and the indirect effect, expected to make a substantial contribution to the creative industry.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">This research aims to examine the empirical evidence on the effect of interpersonal trust on job satisfaction through the knowledge-sharing behaviour among creative industry employees in East Java. Various studies have revealed that employee job satisfaction gets essential attention for the industry so that employees have a high commitment to the company and there is no turnover (O’Connor, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Therefore, the management must understand the importance of interpersonal trust and knowledge-sharing behaviour among its employees. The creative industry can be at the forefront of the competition as long as the management maintains and fosters the quality of employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This research confirmed that the organization's disposition towards knowledge flow and the knowledge structure. It can be meant by which the tendency to trust employees results in job satisfaction. Therefore, management must create conditions to facilitate the flow of</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">information and knowledge, thereby creating a tendency to trust among employees, to push employees towards higher performance levels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The research results describe that interpersonal trust has a significant effect on knowledge sharing, knowledge sharing has a significant effect on job satisfaction, and interpersonal trust affects job satisfaction. This study also indicates that interpersonal trust has a significant indirect effect on job satisfaction mediated by knowledge sharing. This statement means that high interpersonal trust between employees will increase employee knowledge sharing. This can further increase employee job satisfaction in the creative industries in East Java.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Managerial Implication</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The managerial implications for the research result are to cover the disclosure of the importance of knowledge-sharing behavior on interpersonal trust. According to the results study, knowledge sharing and job satisfaction levels can increase when mutual trust is spread among all employees in an organization. Trust is considered an essential component in professional life because it has beneficial consequences for employees and the organization. A higher level of trust in the organization can increase creative industry employees in East Java to be more satisfied in their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Furthermore, the knowledge-sharing behavior between the employees has to be encouraged and modeled by the management because it can help the organization build trust so that there will be a greater tendency for interpersonal trust and job satisfaction. Management should highlight this research results about the importance of encouraging the knowledge flow in the organization. It can be done by recommending the expansion of boundaries for the contact and the interaction among all employee levels. One way to increase knowledge sharing among organizational employees is to increase trust between workers. Therefore, parties should encourage a climate of trust in the organization to increase the employee's welfare and satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Limitation and further research</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This research was conducted in a cross-section which was only carried out in a limited time at the time of the study. Collecting data in this way causes limitations in dealing with data development over a more extended period. So that further research should conduct data collection longitudinally to obtain higher data validity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition, this study used a quantitative study by distributing questionnaires. In a study like this, not all respondents may understand the questions or statements in the questionnaire, so that interpretation bias may occur. Due to this reason, further researchers can refine with qualitative studies to provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between the three concepts studied and explore this relationship.</span></p>
