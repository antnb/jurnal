<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Abstract</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Language is a highly elaborated signaling system. It serves various functions in communication, it is used to share ideas, convey feelings and emotions, etc. The researchers are interested to uncover more on how people use language in terms of its variety and lexical in one of the popular social media networking platforms that we all know as Facebook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the aforementioned background of the study, the problem of the research can be formulated as follows: (1) what are the figurative languages used in Facebook posts by female and male Facebook users? (2) How are the emotional lexical varieties e.g. used in Facebook posts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Method of research is a procedure needed to do the research better. In this case, method of research covers data source, data collection and data analysis. The data of this research have been taken from Facebook, it is as an online social networking website where people can create profiles, share information such as photos and quotes about themselves, and respond or link to the information posted by others. The method that used in collecting data is method of library research. They are collected by reading the Facebook user’s post, by underlining and note taking as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The data analysis is the last step in this process of writing this research. The analysis is done by descriptive method. To make the analysis clearer, all of examples are completed with explanation. Referring to the first research problem, there are some figurative languages used by the Facebook users such as, Simile (female 1 or 4.3% and male 0%), Metaphor (female 4 or 17.3% and male 0%),, Personification (female 3 or 1.3% and male 1% or 4.3%),, Hyperbole (female 4 or 17.3% and male 1 or 4.3%), and Idiom (female 3 or 13% and male 0%),. Furthermore, in regards to the second problem that is emotional lexical used by the Facebook Users, we could mention that both the Augmentatives (female 3 or 13% and male 1 or 4.3%), and Euphemisms (female 1 or 4.3% and male 1 or 4.3%), are used in the Facebook posts</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Keywords</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">: Figurative, lexical variety, Facebook, Post</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>I INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A language is a social fact, a kind of social contract. It exists not in an individual, but in a community. Language can also be viewed as a mental reality. It exists in the heads of people who speak it, and we assume its existence because of people’s ability to learn languages in general and their practice in dealing with at least one particular language. ‘A grammar is a mental entity, represented in the mind / brain of an individual and characterizing that individual’s linguistic capacity’ (Lightfoot 2000: 231). Note that Lightfoot here talks of a grammar rather than of a language, but one possible definition of a language is precisely that it is the grammatical system which allows speakers to produce appropriate utterances. ‘Grammar’ has as many meanings as ‘language’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A major topic in sociolinguistics is the connection, if any, between the structures, vocabularies, and ways of using particular languages and the social roles of the men and women who speak these languages. There are differences between men and women are hardly a matter of dispute. On average, females have fatter and less muscle than males, are not as strong, and weigh less. They also mature more rapidly and live longer. The female voice usually has different characteristics from the male voice, and often females and males exhibit different ranges of verbal skills. However, we also know that many of the differences may result from different socialization practices (Wardhaugh 2006).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The word ‘gender’, originally a grammatical term, has come to refer to the social roles and behavior of individuals arising from their classification as biologically male or female. This is a huge complex embracing virtually all aspects of social behavior of which language is only one. In the past three decades or so intensive research has been carried out into the relationship of language and gender, largely by female scholars who have felt drawn to the topic because of the obvious discrimination against women which has taken place in the past and which is still to be observed today (Thomas 2004).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Language is a highly elaborated signaling system. We call the aspects that are peculiar to it, the design features of language. Some of these we find only with the language of human beings, others we have in common with animals. Another aspect of human language is that we express thoughts with words. In relation to express thoughts in words, a major topic in language closely related to sociolinguistics is the connection, if any, between the structures, vocabularies, and ways of using particular languages especially in some Medias for public to see and read it. Referring to this previous explanation, this research intends to dig further how people have applied the figurative languages in terms of its types in their social media posts, how they function this figure of speech to convey their</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">intentions. Relating to the type of figurative language they have used, this research will also look deeper into the emotional lexical that they have used along with the figure of speech that they have applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With further reference to the above objectives, there are two main points to be discussed in this research, namely the types of figurative languages used by the users of Facebook as the biggest social media in the world and the use of Figurative languages, what are the emotional lexical varieties used by the users to give more exaggeration upon their opinions and ideas to share on Facebook.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>II MATERIALS AND METHOD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The data of this research were taken from Facebook. Facebook is an online social networking website where people can create profiles, share information such as photos and quotes about themselves, and respond or link to the information posted by others.The method in collecting the data was library research. They were collected by reading the Facebook user’s post, by underlining and note taking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A casual examination of everyday conversation suggests that English is rife with idioms (e.g., hot under the collar, hit the roof), similes (e.g., mad as a wet hen), metaphor (e.g., down, blue), and other figurative expressions for emotions. These are several figurative languages that we normally use on the daily conversation setting (Becky L. Spivey, M.Ed.) Raymond Hickey (2010) in his book Language and Society also mentions that the Emotional, ‘genteel’ language are; the use of augmentatives ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I’m /delighted you’re going to help. They’re /so kind!</span><span class="font4">’, the use of euphemisms ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peter’s gone to wash his hands</span><span class="font4">.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Method of research is a procedure needed to do the research better. In this case, method of research covers data source, data collection and data analysis. The data of this research will be taken from Facebook, it is as an online social networking website where people can create profiles, share information such as photos and quotes about themselves, and respond or link to the information posted by others. The method that will be used in collecting data is method of library research. They are collected by reading the Facebook user’s post, by underlining and note taking as well.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The discussion session has been parted as two based on the finding in order to answer the questions of this research. The table below shows some figurative languages and emotional lexicons that people normally use when writing posts on Facebook.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Some posts below are the sample taken from Facebook, the rest are attached on the appendices. In addition, according to Becky L. Spivey, M.Ed, in her theory of Figurative Languages, these are several ones that normally used in the daily conversation, namely:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">IMILE</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Becky L. Spivey, M.Ed in her book stated that a simile (sim-uh-lee) uses the words “like” or “as” to compare two explicitly unlike things as being similar (L. Spivey, M.Ed, Becky. 2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Data 1: &quot;It is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as though </span><span class="font3">destiny had embarked on a controlled experiment, depositing two priceless treasures with pinpoint precision in order to observe the outcome.&quot; The brilliance of Amitav Ghosh. The tale of cloves and nutmeg - a story we all should know. (DeNeefe, Janet 2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Referring to what Becky L. Spivey, M.Ed stated, Simile is used here to show the situation as if the destiny has embarked on something. The writer of this post is really expressing the idea of comparison, comparing the condition and situation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3.1.2</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;METAPHOR</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">According to Becky L. Spivey, M.Ed, a metaphor (met-uh-fawr, -fer) suggests something or someone actually becomes or is something else. (L. Spivey, M.Ed, Becky. 2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Data 2: In the past six weeks, the 14,000+ Act for Peace Refugee Week challengers raised $3,241,256 -yes, more than three million dollars - </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">enough to feed 11,254 refugees living in refugee camps for a year</span><span class="font3">. (Richardson, Jennifer 2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the reference to Becky L. Spivey, M.Ed, here the writer is using metaphor to show the indirect comparison stating that something has been enough by saying </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">enough to feed this amount of people (refugees)</span><span class="font4">. This one is also indirectly stating the hyperbole; she intends to exaggerate what she has already received as donations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ERSONIFICATION</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Becky L. Spivey, M.Ed stated that Personification gives animals or inanimate objects human-like characteristics. (L. Spivey, M.Ed, Becky. 2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Data 3:..and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the rains held off very nicely</span><span class="font3">. (Ballinger, Ruccina 2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And referring to the statement of Becky L. Spivey, M.Ed above, the writer is using </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">personification</span><span class="font4">, imagining the rains can postpone something just like humans can stop or delay something.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3.1.4</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HYPERBOLE</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">According to Becky L. Spivey, M.Ed in her book, hyperbole is a statement so exaggerated that no one believes it to be true. (L. Spivey, M.Ed, Becky. 2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Data 4: The absolutely most gobsmacking, mind blowing amazing birthday present EVER! I am persuaded to go away for a night with 2 friends, and by the time I'm at the top of the lane my house is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">invaded by 9 friends</span><span class="font3">, …..(Wheeler, Cat 2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As mentioned by Becky L. Spivey, M.Ed in her book, here the writer of this post is using Hyperbole in the word invaded, the word invade is used to exaggerate the condition that she left the house and now the house being in control by someone else in relation to the epic birthday surprises.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">DIOMS</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Becky L. Spivey, M.Ed stated that an idiom is an expression whose meaning is not predictable from the usual meanings of the words that make it up. (L. Spivey, M.Ed, Becky. 2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Data 5: This is one day you can officially </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">do a rain check</span><span class="font3">! (DeNeefe, Janet 2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Referring to the idea of Becky L. Spivey, M.Ed, the post here is using Idiom: to do a rain check, meaning she will need to postpone or delay any appointments, perhaps also due to the rain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Raymond Hickey (2010) in his book Language and Society also mentions that emotional, ‘genteel’ languages are; the use of augmentatives and the use of euphemisms.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">UGMENTATIVE</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Augmentative includes all of forms of communications (other than oral) that are used to express thoughts, needs, wants, and ideas. It is a morphological form of a word which expresses greater intensity, often in size but also in other attributes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Data 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The circumference of Bali is about 600 kilometers = about 30 half marathons. I plan to run the distance of a ½ marathon/day. And take a rest whenever I need to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let me know if you like to support the great work Solemen is doing helping the disadvantaged in Bali, Indonesia. We are one of the most well-known and trusted charities in Bali. (Throne, Tyr. 2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In these data the male and female Facebook user actually used augmentative in their post. Raymond, Hickey (2010) stated that Augmentative includes all of forms of communications (other than oral) that are used to express thoughts, needs, wants, and ideas. That length sentences was indicating the large size and tell something awkwardness or unattractiveness sentences. The male and female Facebook users used unimportant sentences that made the sentences were unattractive. The data by Jennifer (2017),“</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">my favorite coffee</span><span class="font4"> (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I bring it back from Indonesia whenever I go there</span><span class="font4">), </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">with 100% safe drinking water, sugar and fresh milk, and a muesli mix</span><span class="font4"> ….”she only wanted to tell about how she enjoyed her morning breakfast, she only wanted to express about her though however she told all kinds of her meals on her post. It was not necessary when she described all meals in those sentences. On the other hand, male Facebook user also used long sentences in his post. Throne (2017)posted that “</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I run every day to train for when I will run all the way around the coast of Bali in September 2017 as a fundraiser to support the great work Robert Epstone’sSolemen Indonesia is doing</span><span class="font4">….” However, he used sentences and words very effectively and clearly, these sentences made his posting important for others. Different language variety means different style of language that used by male and female Facebook users.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">UPHEMISM</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The euphemism is a generally innocuous word or expression used in place of one that may be found offensive or suggest something unpleasant. Some euphemisms are intended to amuse; while others use bland, inoffensive terms for things the users wishes to downplay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Data 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In these data, the male and female Facebook users almost used similar style in language. Raymond, Hickey (2010) in his book Language and Society stated thatEuphemism is a generally innocuous word or expression used in place of one that may be found offensive or suggest something unpleasant. In this data, they wanted to offensive something unpleasant. However the male Facebook users needed some suggestions to be known by the reader as the sentences </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Its so great to see all the kinds thoughts and signs of support for the French over Facebook, we really are all united against these</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sick acts of terrorism</span><span class="font4"> (Zalecki, Stefan. 2017). He wanted to suggest the reader to united against terrorism. However this post tried to tell the reader about the offensive unpleasant way to terrorism. In other side, the female Facebook users used similar style in language. She wanted to express about unpleasant condition in rain. However she did not try to give suggestion. She just typed her disappointed felling in her post as the sentence </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This is one day you can officially do a rain check!</span><span class="font4"> (Dennefe, Janet. 2017). This sentence indicated that she expressed about unpleasant felling.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">birthday present EVER I am persuaded to go away for a night with 2 friends, and by the time I’m at the top of the lane my house id invaded by 9 friends, their staff and various tukang for complete makeover. Between 9 am. Friday and 8 pm. Saturday they have cleaned and painted walls and furniture, rewired and hung new lights, installed a new curtains redesigned the seating area and reupholstered it. Made up the bed with designer linen pillows… in short, created an entire fresh and delightful new house for my birthday surprise. I can’t begin to imagine the weeks of planning and shopping and making and work that went into this epic act of love… AND it was a perfectly kept secret. Can’t find the words to express my thanks for your wonderfulness, imagination and love. (Wheeler, Cat. 2017)</span></p></td></tr>
