<p><span class="font4">The strategic location of the island of Bali which is surrounded by sea has a great potential for people in Bali to establish a diving company. Some diving companies in Bali have made various strategies to compete offering diving tour packages. Marketing through the internet is the best way that most diving companies in Bali have recently taken. However, to be able to compete with other similar companies on the internet, the website must be easily accessible to internet users, i.e. by appearing on the first page of the Google search engine. SEO or search engine optimization is an internet marketing strategy that serves to increase website visibility by targeting certain keywords. The use of SEO can have a positive impact on increasing online sales, increasing website visibility and brand awareness on the internet. This study aims to analyze the extent to which SEO techniques have a positive impact on the marketing of diving tourism in Bali through the internet, using quantitative descriptive methods. The research was conducted in three selected companies, namely Bali Diving, Atlantis Dune, and Scuba Adventure. The results of the study showed that diving companies in Bali have obtained all the positive impacts of SEO. These impacts were increasing website visibility, brand awareness, and sales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Keywords: Diving in Bali, Internet Marketing, SEO, Bali Tourism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The beauty of the beach of Bali</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Island has great potential for developing business in the field of marine tourism,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">especially diving operator. Each diving spot in Bali presents its own uniqueness to explore, such as the Manta ray center in Nusa Penida, underwater garden in Pemuteran, and ship wreck spots in Amed and Tulamben (Asia Web Direct, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The potential of diving tourism in Bali Island can actually be developed in almost all regencies. The big contribution is also given by the island of Bali in an effort to increase Indonesia's foreign exchange, with most of its income coming from the marine tourism sector, especially diving and snorkeling activities (Hidayah, Sunarti and Hakim, 2017). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wiranatha, Suryawardani, Bendesa, &amp;&nbsp;Antara (2016), the level of satisfaction of foreign tourists in diving activities in Bali were mostly satisfied, ranging between 78.5% and 95.6%. The highest level of satisfaction was dive guides (95.6%) and the lowest was accessibility to the diving sites (78.5%).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The magnitude of the diving business potential in Bali raises several foreign and local companies that compete to offer diving tour packages in Bali. Internet marketing is the most effective way chosen by several diving companies in Bali to compete in marketing diving tourism packages. SEO or search engine optimization is one of the internet marketing strategies that recently began to be popular in the community, as well as in the field of diving tourism. SEO strategies are able to help several websites of diving companies in Bali appear on the first page of the Google search engine, so as to be able to compete offering diving packages via the internet. SEO is a website </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font3">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">optimization strategy by the creation of content and using certain keywords so that websites can be easily found on search engine pages (Rahman, 2015). The use of SEO can have a positive impact on the company, especially in increasing website visibility, brand awareness, and sales of company products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the ranking of the diving websites on the Google page, there are three diving companies that always succeed in occupying the first page of the Google search engine, with keywords 'dive in Bali' and 'diving in Bali'. The three companies are Adventure Scuba Diving, Atlantis Dune, and Bali Diving. Through these companies, samples were taken to prove the positive impact of SEO utilization on the diving tourism business competition in Bali through the internet and to find out which of the most influential impacts for each diving company. Currently there is still little research on the impact of SEO utilization on the diving business so that this research is expected to be able to add references to research on SEO in the tourism sector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">METHODOLOGY</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Theories</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The theory of internet marketing was used in this research. According to Wong (2010), internet marketing is a series of activities carried out by a </span><span class="font3">e-ISSN: 2407-392X. p-ISSN: 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">company to market a product or service using the internet. Internet marketing provides convenience both in terms of time efficiency, costs, and geographical boundaries of a region. The growth of internet users in each country is also the basis for the formation of internet marketing ideas in various fields, including diving businesses in Bali. One of internet marketing startegy that is used by the diving companies is SEO strategy. SEO stands for search engine optimization, which is one of the internet marketing strategies by optimizing the quality of the website, so that the website can be easily found by information seekers on the search engine pages (Rahman, 2015).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Hakim (2011) SEO strategies can be divided into 2, namely on-page optimization and off-page optimization. On-page technique is a technique used to optimize website elements, namely title tags, description tags, urls, and page content. On-page techniques differ from off-page optimization techniques, namely optimization techniques outside the website elements. Off-page techniques are usually in the form of spreading links in the form of social media publications, blogs, and threads in online forums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SEO strategies can provide several positive effects, namely increasing website visibility on the internet, increasing brand awareness, and selling products (Alam, 2015 in Satibi, Suharyono, &amp;&nbsp;Abdillah, 2017). The three positive effects of SEO are then used as variables in this study, where each variable consists of 2 to 4 indicators. Brand awareness variable according to Homburg, Klarmann, &amp;&nbsp;Schmitt (2010) can be divided into 4 parts, namely top of mind, brand recall, brand recognition, and brand knowledge. Furthermore, according to Joubert, Garg, &amp;&nbsp;Pellissier (2004), an increase in sales can be seen from the company's financial profitability. Variables for increasing website visibility can be measured from global rank and ranking on SERP. Indicators of increasing website visibility can be checked online and periodically using the SEO checking tool, namely alexa.com</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Research Methods</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The research uses descriptive quantitative method, by conducting a survey directly into the field using documentation studies, questionnaires and interview guidelines. Questionnaires were distributed to consumers of the diving companies and made to measure the brand awareness level variables. The interview guide was used to interview the companies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">to measure the success of product sales. Checking the quality of the website was also carried out every day for a month to determine the development of the websites' visibility after using SEO.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All variables were measured in order to answer research questions, namely what are the effects of SEO utilization on the competition of diving businesses in Bali, as well as the most influential effects for each diving company. The data obtained were then described descriptively, presented in the form of graphs and tables, and tested for its validity and reliability so that it is feasible to be used as research data.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">All diving companies, namely Adventure Scuba Diving, Atlantis Dune, and Bali Diving have used on-page SEO and off-page optimization strategies. Off-page optimization techniques are shown through the number of backlinks or the dissemination of website information through social media, blogs, and online forums. Bali Diving has around 52 backlinks, Atlantis Dune 107 backlinks, and Adventure Scuba Diving has the smallest number of backlinks, as many as 7 backlinks every month. Furthermore, the on-page SEO technique is demonstrated through the creation of website elements</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">that match the keywords of diving company products, namely the keywords 'diving in Bali' and 'dive in Bali'. The use of keywords in website elements can be elaborated as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The table above shows that Atlantis Dune, Bali Diving and Adventure Scuba Diving have arranged the content and elements of their websites in such a way by using words that are relevant to the keywords &quot;Diving in Bali&quot; and &quot;Dive in Bali&quot;. The frequency of repetition of the words &quot;dive&quot;, &quot;diving&quot; and &quot;Bali&quot; on page content, URL, meta title and description can have a positive effect on the ranking of the website on the google search engine page which automatically increases the number of visitors. From Table 1, Bali Diving looks most detailed in arranging keywords in website elements. Conversely, Scuba Diving Adventure seems to be at the least that optimizing the elements of its website by using the keywords &quot;dive in Bali&quot; and &quot;diving in Bali&quot;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Information about diving in Bali; the higher the ranking of the company's website, the greater the possibility of a website to be visited by prospective buyers. To find out the effect of SEO on increasing the ranking of websites on the google page, it was checked every day for a month, from the 1st to the 30th of August 2018. The checking of the ranking of websites was performed manually, namely by searching for information about diving in Bali on the google.com page, use the keyword &quot;diving in Bali&quot;. The ranking of the websites of Atlantis Dune, Bali Diving, and Scuba Diving Adventure on the Google search engine can be presented as follows:</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

Although the ranking on the Bali Diving search engine page is superior because it has good website content, Atlantis Dune has more visitors than Bali Diving, because it spreads more links on blogs, articles, online forums, and social media.
