<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract </span><span class="font1">This study focuses on the concept of pedestrian path arrangement in terms of physical and non-physical conditions as well as user behavior. The research was conducted in commercial areas on Jalan Ahmad Yani and Diponegoro in Singaraja City, based on the phenomenon of pedestrian paths that are currently experiencing a change of function. The research method used is a qualitative method using place-centered mapping techniques for data collection. The place-centered mapping technique is used for mapping the location of activities / pedestrian paths and user sketches in using pedestrian paths which results in the concept of structuring pedestrian paths. The results of this study indicate that the current pedestrian paths in Singaraja City are not in accordance with the behavior of its users due to physical conditions and the change in the function of the pedestrian paths by parking, trading and displaying merchandise. So the concept of structuring the comfort of the pedestrian path that is produced is in the form of a pedestrian lane that should not be obstructed by behavioral activities or other supporting facilities, the need to provide an on-street parking area, the need for attention in terms of the pavement material used on the pedestrian path to comply with standards and the need for additional leveling. as well as pedestrian pathway dividers.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark5"></a>I.</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Singaraja City is one of the cities located in Bali Province. This city in northern Bali with an area of 27.98 km2 with a population of 80,500 people (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2015) [1]. The number of residents in the city of Singaraja, which is increasing every year, affects aspects of community behavior that are increasingly diverse. The following behavior applies to facilities for private and group interests to interact with each other in several public places, so it needs to be balanced with adequate and appropriate public facilities, such as pedestrian path targets that are in accordance with the needs and behavior of pedestrians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Judging from the speed, the walking mode has many advantages, namely the low speed so that it is advantageous because it can observe the environment (Iswanto, 2006) [2]. Lang (1994) [3] said that the pedestrian path has a link between the origin and destination of the movement of people related to the function of the pedestrian path and other functions. From that all the most important thing is circulation for pedestrians in walking activities. According</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">to Uterman (1984) [4], the design of space for pedestrians meets the needs of pedestrians. Pedestrian comfort should have an easy path to walk. This is because pedestrians are an important and essential form of movement activity of the transportation system and must get the required place. Therefore, research on the convenience of pedestrian paths in Singaraja City is reviewed through a study of user behavior. This is done to determine the concept of pedestrian path comfort in accordance with the behavior of pedestrian path users at the research location.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The case study of this research pedestrian path is on Jalan Ahmad Yani and Diponegoro, which are the main collector roads, connecting various urban areas including the area. This road is always passed because it is in the center of Singaraja City which is the center of various commercial activities, including education, government, and trade, but the area is not equipped with supporting facilities such as insufficient parking space, especially on Jalan Ahmad Yani, seen some people or visitors park vehicle on the pedestrian path. As well as some street furniture on the pedestrian path in this area is still incomplete. As at several points on Jalan Ahmad Yani and Diponegoro from 7.00 am</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">to 20.00 pm it was seen that several users parked their vehicles on the pedestrian path, besides that the pedestrian path was used as a place for selling and as a place for displaying merchandise by owner of a shop located on Ahmad Yani and Diponegoro streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All of these things seem to have become a habit, apart from causing inconvenience to walking, it also causes damage at several points to the material that is passed by vehicles and the use of materials that are not suitable for use on pedestrian paths Identification of pedestrian paths, user behavior, influence and behavior on the function of pedestrian paths in this area becomes a discussion to be analyzed in this observation and research.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark7"></a>II.</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The research method used is a qualitative method using a centralized mapping technique for data collection. The qualitative data needed is data on public spaces such as data on existing pedestrian paths in the center of Singaraja City. The research location chosen is Jalan Ahmad Yani and Diponegoro, because these two roads are located in the city's commercial center area which is often visited by the people of Singaraja City. There are various activities such as offices, shops, markets and schools. Based on the concept of pedestrian circulation, it is studied based on the physical condition and users of the pedestrian path. For this reason, data collection methods were carried out to obtain data in accordance with the required data. The data collection technique used in this research is through primary data collection which is carried out by centralized mapping data collection techniques, as well as primary surveys, namely documentation, questionnaires, and interview techniques. The place-centered mapping technique is carried out in several steps, such as preparing a schedule for observing the activities of pedestrians, then making a base map, sketching the settings, making direct observations at a predetermined time, after coding the activities to be observed. This technique is also used for activity sites/pedestrian paths and user sketches using pedestrian paths. Interviews were used to analyze the conditions and characteristics of the study location to find the comfort of circulation on the pedestrian path according to the behavior of its users. The interview technique is to determine the perception of the sample and to get more accurate information about the data you want to know.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark9"></a>III.</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literature</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The theory used in this study is the city center theory. Multiple Center Theory (Harris and Ullman, 1945) [5] states that the city center is located relatively in the middle of other cells and serves as a &quot;growing point&quot;. This zone accommodates most of the city's activities, in the form of a center for transportation facilities and in it there are special service areas, such as special areas for banking, theater and others (Yunus, 2000: 49).[6] The next theory is the path of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">destruction theory. Pedestrian walking is defined as the movement, circulation, movement of people from one place of origin (origin) to another as a destination (destination) on foot (Rubenstein, 1992) [7]. Good pedestrians must be able to carry out pedestrian activities smoothly and safely. Indicators of pedestrian comfort according to Nineik (2009) [8] are circulation, climate, noise, smell or smell, shape, safety, cleanliness, and beauty. Behavior Mapping theory According to Sommer, 1980 [9] in Behavior Mapping is described in the form of a sketch or diagram of an area where humans carry out various activities. The aim is to describe behavior on a map, identify the type and frequency of behavior, and show the relationship between the behavior and a specific design form. This behavior mapping can be done directly at the time and place where observations are made then based on the notes made. There are two ways to do behavioral mapping, namely Place-centered mapping. This technique is used to find out how humans or a group of humans utilize, use and accommodate their behavior at a time in a certain place. The steps that must be taken in this technique are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a sketch of the place/setting which includes all the physical elements that are expected to affect the behavior of the space user.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a list of behaviors to be observed and define symbols/signs, sketch each behavior.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then within a certain period of time, the researcher records various behaviors that occur in that place using symbols on the prepared base map.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">Fig. 1 Pedestrian Line Segment</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In reviewing the characteristics of the pedestrian paths on Jalan Ahmad Yani and Diponegoro, what is meant is dimensions, pavement materials used, supporting facilities and others. The pedestrian path at the research site is always active, from morning to evening users pass through this pedestrian path.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After observing segment 1, this pedestrian path is more dominated by shopping and market areas with a pedestrian path dimension of 1.8m wide. The pavement material used</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">is paving block with a size of 20x20 and several points using ceramics with a size of 30x30. Supporting facilities are available such as parking for 4-wheeled and 2-wheeled vehicles, pergolas, shade tree pots and decorative lights mounted on shade trees. This pedestrian path has not been equipped with a special path for the disabled.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/90802-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:241pt;height:193pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 2 Pedestrian Line Segment 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In segment 2, this pedestrian path has a width of 1.6-2 m. The pavement material used is paving block with a size of 20x20. Supporting facilities available such as shelters, pergolas, and some spots look shady because they are equipped with shade trees and planting boxes for ornamental plants. This pedestrian path is not yet equipped with lighting, as well as special lanes for the disabled.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/90802-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:240pt;height:209pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 3 Pedestrian Line Segment 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The pedestrian path in segment 3 has a dimension of 1.8m, using various materials at several points such as using paving blocks with a size of 20x20 cm, reinforced concrete and ceramics with a motif size of 30x30. This pedestrian path has been equipped with supporting facilities such as trash cans and railings. However, this segment has not been equipped with special lanes for people with disabilities and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">lighting for pedestrian paths.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/90802-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:237pt;height:177pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 3 Pedestrian Line Segment 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the results of research at the study sites that have been carried out, the pedestrian paths on Jalan Diponegoro and Ahmad Yani have different dimensions, namely 1.8m-2m, with the material used varies at several points of the pedestrian path such as paving blocks. with a size of 20cm x 20cm, a ceramic motif of 30cm x 30cm and cast concrete, this happened because there was no repair that caused the shop owner to replace the pedestrian path material. while the supporting facilities provided are only planter boxes, shelters and shade plants. Activities on the pedestrian paths on Diponegoro and Ahmad Yani roads are quite dense for users, peaking in the morning and evening on weekdays and holidays. The condition of the pedestrian path at several points is damaged and some shop owners deliberately display their wares across the boundary of the pedestrian path so as to make pedestrians feel uncomfortable. In addition, many pedestrian paths are also converted as selling points by traders, thereby reducing the dimensions of pedestrian paths and parking lots by visitors and shop owners, due to the lack of parking space currently available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The pedestrian paths on Diponegoro and Ahmad Yani roads are still not accompanied by the use of special materials for persons with disabilities, although they are equipped with ramps, the existing ramps still need to be repaired, because they are misused by motorcyclists who ride the pedestrian paths. The dimensions of the pedestrian path at some points are reduced due to street vendors displaying merchandise and improper placement of electric poles, therefore a pedestrian path concept is needed which can later provide a structuring concept in accordance with the behavior of its users, so that there is no transfer of function pedestrian path.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/90802-5.jpg" alt="" style="width:240pt;height:208pt;">

<p><span class="font1">From the results of observations made through the Behavioral Mapping method on pedestrian paths in Singaraja City Center which was observed in the morning at 08.00-17.00 WIB and in the afternoon at 19.00-22.00 WIB and was observed repeatedly every 15 minutes changing spots and repeated every day at 12.00 WIB. the same, namely: weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday), and holidays (Saturday, Sunday, red date) by marking the behavior on the map provided, it was found that the composition/number of users seen from the behavior and movement of users did not always the same, the user behavior mapping sketch is quite clear to see the difference, both in the morning and at night.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/90802-6.jpg" alt="" style="width:237pt;height:151pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 5 Mapping the behavior of ordinary day users in the morning-evening</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Fig. 6 Mapping the behavior of ordinary day users Ordinary Day At Night</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the data obtained using behavioral mapping techniques in Figure 6, namely on weekdays at night on the pedestrian paths Jalan Ahmad Yani and Diponegoro are dominated by the behavior of pedestrians, vehicle parking and trading, with an average of 10-70 people per day. . pedestrians, trading behavior 10-50 people, vehicle parking behavior 20-80 people.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/90802-8.jpg" alt="" style="width:241pt;height:137pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 7 Mapping of Holiday User Behavior at Night</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By using behavioral mapping techniques observed in the prepared map in Figure 7, it was found that on holidays at night the behavior was dominated by walking, parking vehicles and selling, with an average of 10-80 people per day. parking behavior, 10-50 people walking user behavior and 10-20 people selling user behavior.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">After being analyzed in each segment using behavioral mapping techniques, namely marking the observed behavior on a map that has been prepared for two full months, on weekdays from morning to evening on the pedestrian paths Jalan Ahmad Yani and Diponegoro are dominated by the behavior of users walking ,displaying merchandise and parked vehicles. The data obtained on average per day reaches 50-100 people behavior of users walking, 40-80</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Fig. 8 Mapping of User Behavior on Holidays in the Morning-Evening</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After being analyzed in each segment using behavioral mapping techniques, namely marking the observed behavior on a map that has been prepared for two full months, on weekdays from morning</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/90802-10.jpg" alt="" style="width:240pt;height:92pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 9 Percentage of Number of Pedestrian Users on Jalan Ahmad Yani and Diponegor</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the diagram above, it can be concluded that in the morning and evening on weekdays the Ahmad Yani and Diponegoro roads are dominated by pedestrians with a percentage of 30%, 27% of users park their vehicles on the pedestrian path, then 21% of road users. users display merchandise, and at night on weekdays it is dominated by vehicle parking behavior on pedestrian paths with a percentage of 29%, walking behavior as much as 27%, then selling behavior 21%. Meanwhile, on holidays in the morning and evening, walking behavior is dominated by 38%, vehicle parking behavior is 32%, and merchandise display behavior is 11%, and at night on holidays, vehicle parking behavior is 37%. foot as much as 29% and selling behavior as much as 13% on the pedestrian path. This shows that the behavior of users walking on pedestrian paths in Singaraja City is dominated in the morning on weekdays and holidays, while selling behavior on pedestrian paths only occurs at night on weekdays and holidays and tends to occur in segments 2 and 3. The behavior of users parking their vehicles on the pedestrian path is highest when compared to the behavior of users displaying merchandise and buying and selling that occurs in the morning and evening. For the behavior of users who display merchandise on the pedestrian path tends to occur in the morning to evening on weekdays, while at night and on holidays the behavior of shop owners displaying merchandise decreases, this is because the shop is closed at night and on holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the results of interviews with users of pedestrian paths on Jalan Ahmad Yani and Diponegoro, pedestrian</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">behavior feels less comfortable using the pedestrian path, due to the transfer of functions and behavioral deviations on the pedestrian path which is used as a parking lot, selling and displaying merchandise by shop owners. , from the data obtained, this occurs due to the lack of available parking spaces, both from the government, and from shop owners in providing parking spaces for visitors. The behavior of traders who sell on pedestrian paths has actually long been prohibited by the Singaraja City Government because the function of pedestrians in general is for pedestrians, but what happens on the contrary is the space for pedestrians is getting narrower because of their existence. From the survey results, this is due to the unavailability of land for them to sell in the market, and this is due to the Banyuasri market, which was the place for selling traders previously, which is currently being renovated. This is also due to the behavior of buyers who prefer to buy the merchandise of street vendors because it shortens their time when shopping where pedestrians who use the pedestrian path are mostly housewives, traders/entrepreneurs and office employees who like a more effective time when shopping. . It can be concluded that the concept of a pedestrian path in the center of Singaraja City is not in accordance with the current behavior of its users, because there are still many functions changing due to behavior that is not in accordance with the function of the pedestrian path. In addition, the lack of clear boundaries in displaying merchandise caused by the replacement of the pedestrian path material which is the same as the shop owner's building, this is what causes pedestrian comfort to be disturbed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors that cause the Incompatibility of the Pedestrian Path Concept to the Behavior of its Users in the Singaraja City Center</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">From the results of the analysis of physical conditions and user behavior that are interrelated using behavioral mapping techniques, it is focused on behaviors that are not in accordance with the function of the pedestrian path, including: parking vehicles on the pedestrian path, selling, displaying merchandise and crossing not in the places that have been provided. . The two analyzes resulted in several factors causing the inappropriateness of the pedestrian path concept in the center of Singaraja City to the behavior of its users as follows.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The results of interviews with users who sell on the pedestrian path due to the lack of a selling area for traders cause traders to choose to sell on the pedestrian path.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The arrangement of supporting facilities is not</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">paid attention to, causing some pedestrian paths to be blocked by electric pole foundations, street lighting foundations, inappropriate pavement materials, and the lack of supporting facilities such as seats (observations). According to Rubenstein (1992), in the design of pedestrian paths, it must also be equipped with street furniture, one of which is park benches as a place to rest for pedestrians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The boundary between the pedestrian path and the shop area is unclear due to the replacement of the same pavement material as the shop area, so that some shop owners display their wares to cross the pedestrian path. (Interview result)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the results of field observations, the surface of pedestrian paths, leveling and ramps still need to be improved and the addition of special pavements for people with disabilities.</span></p>
