This can be seen from the lives of these indigenous peoples in carrying out their daily lives still following the customs and rules contained in the region. Seeing the high existence of indigenous peoples in the village, it is necessary to examine the relationship of the existence of indigenous peoples to the development of architecture and interiors in these traditional Balinese houses. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of indigenous peoples in preserving traditional Balinese houses. This study uses a method with a qualitative approach and a cultural studies perspective. The results of this study indicate that the existence of indigenous peoples in the village of Muncan affects the architectural and interior development of their homes.

One of the unique traditions that are still maintained today is the level of community togetherness that is still high in organizing a traditional or religious activity. This can be seen from the activities of the indigenous people who help each other and work together in preparing the ceremony. All the activities of the indigenous people in the village of Pakraman Muncan affect the development of the architecture and interior of the houses they live in. All the designs contained in the residence are cultural products that are tied to the lives of the indigenous people who occupy them. In their homes, people always provide a certain style and characteristic so that it gives a sign of the existence of socio-cultural life in it.

<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions and Lives of Indigenous Peoples in Muncan Customary Village</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The people of Muncan Pakraman or Customary Village are people who in their daily lives develop according to customs/traditions and are guided by local customs. The social system in the village of Pakraman Muncan is a traditional banjar. The village of Pakraman Muncan consists of 11 traditional banjars, namely Banjar Abian Bangbang, Banjar Yangapi, Banjar Susut, Banjar Gede, Banjar Geria, Banjar Pasek, Banjar Jero Kanginan, Banjar Kawan, Banjar Pakudansih, Banjar Benekasa, and Banjar Gunung Biau.

<p><span class="font4">This dadia group is a group of relatives who are members of the same scope of the Dadia temple. The activities carried out by the dadia members are almost the same as the banjar members but are closer and of a familial nature, such as for example holding religious or traditional ceremonies such as piodalan, weddings and so on.

<p><span class="font4">A change is a phenomenon that always colors the history of every society and its culture (Pitana, 1994: 3). All forms of residential design in the village of Pakraman Muncan are the product of the adaptation of the indigenous peoples to the development of their culture, economy, environment and local architectural style. In this case, the existence of indigenous peoples in the village of Pakraman Muncan is the main agent in determining the architectural and interior development of their homes. This can be seen from several forms of the existence of indigenous peoples that are carried out in daily life in the area of their homes such as still maintaining traditions (customs), applying beliefs to the design of their homes, a. Tradition (Habit)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In living their socio-cultural life, the indigenous people in the village of Pakraman Muncan still maintain the traditions or habits that have been passed down for a long time. Some traditions that are still carried out indirectly influence the design of the house.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/84086-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:296pt;height:110pt;">

<p><span class="font4">One of the traditional activities that are still carried out is mebat. Mebat is a tradition of indigenous peoples in the form of activities carried out in mutual cooperation in making Balinese specialties, namely satay and lawar. This Balinese food is usually made to be served</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">as offerings or offerings and also as a banquet for guests who come. This mebat activity generally requires a large area such as on the terrace or natah in the yard. In addition to mebat, another mutual cooperation activity is nguopin which is an activity in making ceremonies or offerings. This activity also requires a large space, such as in open bales or terraces.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/84086-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:267pt;height:109pt;">

<p><span class="font4">Other traditional activities that also influence the creation of conservation of traditional values, especially in the design of their homes, are the megibung tradition. Megibung is an activity of eating together (a group of 5-8 people) in the same container/place. Generally, the megibung tradition is carried out in religious ceremonies such as weddings, deaths and so on. This activity also requires a large space and is generally carried out in bale-bale such as bale gede, bale daja or in the natah yard. The next tradition is carried out at the time of penmpahan galungan or at the time of otonan, namely the natab bikala tradition for men who are teenagers and carried out on natah yards.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">One form of the existence of indigenous peoples is the holding of traditional and religious ceremonies. In a traditional organization in the form of banjar and dadia, the indigenous people are active in social interaction with each other in helping each other in preparing the religious or traditional ceremony. This proves that indigenous peoples play an indirect role in maintaining the existence of buildings that have traditional values such as sanggah/merajan, bale daja, bale gede, natah and kitchen. For example, the implementation of the god yadnya ceremony in the sanggah/merajan building, the human yadnya ceremony at the bale gede, activities in preparation for religious or traditional ceremonies such as making offerings that require space in the bale daja area, bale dangin and natah in the yard.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/84086-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:222pt;height:109pt;">

<p><span class="font4">The existence of indigenous peoples in the village of Pakraman Muncan is also seen in one family both within the scope of dadia and the family of one natah in conducting deliberation activities or commonly called sangkep. Generally, the sangkep activity is carried out as the first step in preparing for traditional or religious ceremonies by conducting negotiations first. This activity is carried out in bale delod or bale daja or open spaces such as terraces. This sangkep culture shows that the indigenous people in the village of Pakraman Muncan still instill the values of democracy and togetherness. This is also a strong basis for some of the buildings still maintain a large terrace to provide a place for the participants of the sangkep.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">All forms of the existence of indigenous peoples in the village of Pakraman Muncan indirectly influence the realization of the preservation of traditional Balinese architecture in their homes. Broadly speaking, the architectural design of residential houses in Pakraman Muncan Village applies the concept of Traditional Balinese Architecture but follows developments according to the latest science and technology. This can be seen from the model shape and building materials as well as a more organized garden arrangement. The concept of traditional Balinese architecture can be seen from its architectural characteristics such as the pattern of building layout in the yard that still applies the Sanga Mandala concept, the structure of the building uses the Tri Angga concept, the function and layout of the space, the variety of decorations / ornaments in the form of Balinese carvings and the building materials still use materials from nature. . One example of the application of the concept of traditional Balinese architecture in the picture below is the spatial arrangement according to the Sanga Mandala concept. The spaces formed are used to meet the needs of indigenous peoples as housing for example Bale Dangin and Bale Delod as well as holding religious ceremonies for example Merajan, Natah, Bale Gede and Bale Daja.</span></p>

The development of this architecture and interior is based on limited land so that to accommodate the activities of these indigenous peoples, especially those related to customs and religion, the residential buildings need to be rearranged. One example is the need for space which tends to be more than before. In addition, it follows the concept of contemporary housing that maximizes the function of the spaces in it so that it is more practical and easy to access between these spaces.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/84086-9.jpg" alt="" style="width:253pt;height:180pt;">

<p><span class="font4">The picture above is an example of a front view of a residential building in Pakraman Muncan Village which still applies the concept of traditional Balinese architecture but the use of the spaces inside is more complex. On the outside it still provides a large terrace for holding religious and traditional ceremonies, but inside, the interior has been arranged according to the concept of a contemporary residential building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this study, it can be concluded that various forms of the existence of indigenous peoples in the village of Pakraman Muncan affect the architectural and interior development of their houses. This can be seen from the existence of a mindset, activities that contain elements of religion, traditions and beliefs that are applied to the arrangement of spaces and the form of residential buildings. In order to support the preservation of the concept of traditional Balinese architecture, there have been changes to the interior of the residential building, especially the spatial arrangement. Indigenous peoples have now begun to design how to maintain the existence of spaces for holding religious and traditional ceremonies as well as all activities related to traditions but also to meet the need for spaces for housing. So one of the buildings that is used as a residential building, interior design is carried out by rearranging the spaces so that they can meet their daily needs such as resting, cooking, bathing, working and so on. That way, indigenous peoples can still maintain spaces such as the existence of sanggah, natah, bale gede, bale daja and wide open space (terrace) and their arrangement still applies the concept of sanga mandala.</span></p>
