<p><span class="font1">This research article explores the branding strategy of Undisan Rural Tourism in Bangli Regency, with a focus on its success in winning the 3rd Places of Tourism Village Award through an eco-experience. The study utilizes a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis to identify and evaluate key factors that contribute to the village's branding strategy. Undisan Rural Tourism embodies a unique blend of natural beauty, cultural heritage, and sustainable practices, making it an exemplary case study for rural tourism development. The research methodology involves qualitative approaches. Primary data is collected through interviews, surveys, and participant observations, while secondary data is gathered from relevant literature, reports, and online sources. The SWOT analysis framework is applied to assess the internal and external factors that influence the branding strategy of Undisan Rural Tourism. The findings of the study reveal several strengths that have contributed to the success of Undisan Rural Tourism. These include its pristine environment, rich cultural heritage, authentic local experiences, and strong community engagement. Additionally, the village has capitalized on opportunities such as increasing demand for sustainable and eco-friendly tourism experiences. However, the research also identifies certain weaknesses and threats that need to be addressed, including limited infrastructure, inadequate marketing efforts, and competition from neighboring tourism destinations. Based on the SWOT analysis, this article proposes strategic recommendations to further enhance the branding strategy of Undisan Rural Tourism. These include improving infrastructure and facilities, expanding marketing efforts through digital platforms, fostering partnerships with local stakeholders, and implementing sustainable practices to preserve the environment. The study concludes that Undisan Rural Tourism's success in winning the 3rd Places of Tourism Village Award can be attributed to its unique branding strategy, which highlights the village's distinctive characteristics and eco-experi-ences. By addressing the identified weaknesses and capitalizing on existing strengths and opportunities, Undisan Rural Tourism can continue to thrive as a leading destination for sustainable rural tourism, setting an example for other tourism villages in the region</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">To support sustainable tourism, village tourism or rural Tourism can make full use of tourism resources in rural areas to adjust and optimize rural industrial structures, extend the agricultural industrial chain, develop rural tourism services, promote nonagricultural employment, increase the incomes of farmers, and create a better economic base for the new rural construction (Zhang, 2012). Rural tourism is a new form of tourism, which takes the nature and humanities objects with the rural-ity as tourist attractions, depends on the beautiful landscape, the natural environment, architectures, culture and other resources in rural areas, and expands and develops projects such as meeting affairs, holiday-makings and leisure activities based on traditional rural leisure travels and experience tours. Sustainable tourism recognizes the importance of maintaining the social and cultural framework of local communities. By promoting community participation, empowering local businesses, and respecting native culture, tourism can strengthen social cohesion and preserve cultural heritage. This approach ensures that tourism development provides benefits to all involved parties. Bali island, which is part of Indonesia, is one of the famous islands known for its rich cultural and historical tourist destinations, beautiful nature, as well as the potential of villages that can be developed as natural and ecotourism attractions. One of the villages with tourism potential that can be developed is Undisan Rural Tourism, located in Bangli Regency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Undisan Rural Tourism is an interesting example of local community efforts to preserve their traditional culture and promote sustainable tourism. Undisan Rural Tourism showcases natural beauty with its scenic hills, rice fields agricultural.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The &quot;selling of places&quot; and the creation of images are synonymous with destination marketing, while state tourism brochures and advertising campaigns are considered conventional tourism marketing operations (Jamrozy, 2007). While their strategy for identifying and disseminating best practices in tourism is commendable, it adheres to the restrictions of the economic marketing paradigm by &quot;balancing&quot; environmental and economic interests. As a result, it runs the risk of offering compromises rather than radical alternatives in the field of tourism marketing (Jamrozy, 2007). Alternative tourism first emerged as a result of intense criticism of mass tourism and its detrimental consequences on travel destinations. Soft tourism, small-scale tourism, ecotourism, nature tourism, and integrated tourism were all forms of alternative tourism (Christou, 2012). Conventional tourism frequently ignores the need to create jobs, especially for the local population. On the other hand, eco-tourism looks for these chances and makes an effort to use them. While traditional tourism is unaffected by environmental or social principles, eco-tourism is not. Instead, it upholds social, cultural, and environmental values (Singh, 2015). Local cultures, wilderness excursions, volunteer work, personal development, and discovering new ways to survive on our fragile planet are the main topics of ecotourism. Programs that promote local cultural integrity and reduce the damaging effects of traditional tourism on the environment are examples of responsible ecotourism (Singh, 2015). Sustainability principles refer to the environmental, economic, and socio-cultural aspects of tourism development, and a suitable balance must be established between these three dimensions to guarantee its long-term sustainability (UNEP &amp;&nbsp;UNWTO, 2005).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">strongly uphold their traditions and customs. Tourists will have the opportunity to gain deep insights into the daily lives of the community, including agricultural activities, handicrafts, and religious ceremonies. Undisan Rural Tourism, offers a variety of interesting activities for tourists offering a variety of exciting activities for tourists, such as taking part in traditional Balinese cooking classes to learn about authentic Balinese cuisine and traditional cooking techniques. The local residents also provide accommodations in the form of homestays for tourists who want to experience the Balinese community life directly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These homestays offer a unique experience by staying in traditional Balinese houses and interacting with the local people. In addition, Undisan Rural Tourism also offers various ecotourism activities aimed at preserving the natural environment and supporting the local economy. Tourists can participate in tree planting activities, river clean-up efforts, or cycling around the village while enjoying the surrounding natural beauty. In an effort to promote sustainable tourism, the community of Undisan Rural Tourism also maintains cleanliness and environmental preservation. They limit the use of single-use plastics and encourage the use of renewable energy. Undisan Rural Tourism has shown significant progress in its efforts to become a leading tourist destination in Indonesia. Through effective destination branding efforts, Undisan Rural Tourism has successfully attracted tourists from both domestic and international markets. Its remarkable achievements in developing the tourism village have been recognized by the 2022 Village Tourism Award (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anugerah Desa Wisata</span><span class="font2">), an accolade given to the best tourism village in Indonesia. The village is also known for its organic farming and ecofriendly tourism activities. Strong destination branding efforts have been the key to Undisan Rural Tourism's success in capturing the attention of tourists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to maintain the award of the 2022 Tourism Village Award (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anugerah </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Desa Wisata</span><span class="font2">), Undisan Rural Tourism must continue to innovate and improve the quality of tourism services. With continuous efforts in developing the tourism village and establishing a strong destination branding, Undisan Rural Tourism in Bangli Regency has great potential to become one of the best tourism villages in Indonesia. The 2022 Tourism Village Award (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anugerah Desa Wisata</span><span class="font2">) is only the beginning of a long journey towards achieving higher and sustainable achievements. Undisan Rural Tourism will serve as an inspiring example for other Rural Tourism in Indonesia. As a follow-up step after receiving the 2022 Tourism Village Award (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anugerah Desa Wisata</span><span class="font2">), Undisan Rural Tourism needs to continue improving the promotion and marketing of its tourist destinations. This study aims to identify and analyze the branding strategies implemented by Undisan Rural Tourism in Bangli Regency in order to serve as a model for ecologically and sustainably oriented tourism villages.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>LITERATURE REVIEW</span></h2>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Place branding in rural areas: Their connection with related theories of marketing and destination-local identity</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">A rural area which is isolated needs tools to be promoted to the rest of the world and internet is a tool for such a procedure (Kavoura &amp;&nbsp;Bitsani, 2012). Without personal experience, images of destinations are formed from various media and advertising (Molina &amp;&nbsp;Esteban, 2006). If the consumer or tourist has not visited the destination, then the media's role is important because personal experience is an important criterion to influence selection of a destination's image (Molina &amp;&nbsp;Esteban, 2006). Media plays a vital role if the customer or tourist has not visited the destination. This is because personal experience is a crucial factor in determining a destination's image; without personal experience, images are formed from a variety of media and advertising (Molina &amp;&nbsp;Esteban, 2006).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In line with changing trends in the tourism sector, cultural and nature-based tourism are becoming more favorable, and one of the rising tourism objects is &quot;Rural-based&quot; tourism (Yang et al., 2021). Rural Tourism has many benefits for both the place and the people. Some of the benefits taken by its establishment include giving local wisdom to the people and introducing both the area and the culture, which most people usually don't get in their places (Nieto Masot &amp;&nbsp;Rios Rodriguez, 2020). Rural tourism was established primarily for economic reasons as well. The neighbourhood is the one that gains the most from the development of rural tourism because it may lead to the creation of entirely new jobs and a source of income for the locals (Huda et al., 2022). The village will not lose their youngster, which might help the village become more prosperous (Huda et al., 2022). Rural Tourism will keep on rising, as it is become well known that Rural Tourism is promising in the future, as it is shown that people more and more love this concept of tourism (Gautama et al.,2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The digital era enables economic actors to be creative and imaginative when developing competitive strategies. Promotional models that rely solely on product quality and low pricing are insufficient; there must also be a sense of uniqueness that entices consumers to learn more, gather information, visit, and buy (Sudar-miatin et al., 2019) Place branding is a promotion model in business by utilizing a place as the main subject (Sudarmiatin et al., 2019). (According to Kavaratziz, 2005), the idea of location branding is a progression of the branding of products. A brand is created by using a name, word, sign, symbol, design, or a combination of all of these to identify a product or group of products and set it apart from similar products or services (Kotler, 2009). The competitive environment must also be meticulously analysed (Kotler, 2002). According to (Kotler, 2002) consumers have literally thousands of destination choices. They will be drawn to destinations that</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">perceive to offer the value either because they are inexpensive or more accesible. Keller (2003) developed a brand image dimension projected based on the corporate image dimension that encompasses five: professionalism that represents a quality approach of attributes, benefits, and behavior, modern which represents an innovative approach from attributs, benefits and behaviour, serving all segments of society that represent values and programmes of perceived concern for the environment and social responsibility, concern to the consumer that is an approach of customer orientation, security that is the approach of corporate credibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The product and its capabilities, the brand and its name, the brand's symbolism and imagery, and the consumer are all important connecting points in the development of a brand (Meenagham, 1995). Brand definitions place a strong focus on distinctiveness, the existence of both tangible and intangible values that exist in the customer's mind (Hall, 1999; Kim, 1990; Kotler, 1988). Brands have personalities, and these personalities are made up of the emotional added values that the product conveys that are influenced by lifestyle factors and generated through advertising (Meenagham, 1995; Biel, 1997). A name, symbol, logo, word mark, or other graphic that both identifies and distinguishes the location, as well as one that conveys the promise of a memorable travel experience that is exclusively associated with the location, is known as destination branding (Ritchie &amp;&nbsp;Ritchie 1998). According to (Balakrishnan, Nekhili, and Lewis, 2011), there is &quot;a tremendous scope to grow&quot; in destination branding. Regarding the regions covered by the rural tourism project, the positioning process is primarily reflected through the growth of rural/ holistic tourism, which by its very nature combines aspects of uniqueness and adopts the element of tourist experience, bond and coherence rather than consistency. The destination profile, is formed through a popular culture (Dinnie, 2008). In regard to the </span><span class="font1">e-ISSN 2407-392X. p-ISSN 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">concept of brand loyalty, the associations made with the rich cultural resources, including the environmental resources but also the intangible cultural resources values, traditions, customs, way of life that these nations have and the meanings which create, bring powerful sentimen-tal qualities which lead to the sentimental devotion and attachment that derives from the concept of brand loyalty (Dinnie, 2008). Without necessarily implying that rural tourism would lose any of its distinctive traits and work to build a strong place identity, providing customers with alternatives and a variety of activities and resources may be a good option for visitors. (George, Mair &amp;&nbsp;Reid 2009).</span></p>
