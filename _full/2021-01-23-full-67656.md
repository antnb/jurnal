The maximum crucial predictors of pleasure with one-famous person and -famous person class lodging are the lodging infrastructure and the worker expertise. Both predictors had been determined to have rather low degrees of overall performance. Safety and protection and room excellent are huge determinants of pleasure with three-famous person establishments, despite the fact that they under-carry out in regards to protection and protection. In recognize of four-famous person and five-famous person lodging, ready time and patron interaction, each of that have above common overall performance rankings, have an effect on patron pleasure. We offer unique suggestions for managerial interventions to enhance carrier excellent and guests’ pleasure for every grading class</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In this study, the structured variable is consumer satisfaction Y). The structured variable is the variable this is the principle cognizance of the researcher. The essence of a trouble is without problems visible with the aid of using spotting the diverse structured variables utilized in a model. The variability of those elements is researcher attempts to explain Ferdinand, 2006).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The independent variable which is denoted by X) is a variable that affects the dependent variable, whether the influence is positive or the one has a negative effect Ferdinand, 2006).

Correlational research is &quot;research designed to determine the level of relationship between different variables in a population&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this study, it will be known how much the contribution of the independent variables to the dependent variable and how much the relationship occurs using a quantitative approach. This research consists of six variables which include independent variables: Tangible X1), reliability X2), responsiveness X3), assurance X4), empathy X5), and the dependent variable namely customer satisfaction Y). To test the hypothesis, multiple regression analysis is used, in which the technique will test the hypothesis which states that there is an influence between the independent variable and the dependent variable. According to Arikunto 2006) multiple regression analysis is an analysis of the relationship between one dependent variable with or more independent variables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this study, the population is all customers of the Class II Port Authority and Port Authority of Pontianak. A populace is a set of people, events, or the entirety that has positive characteristics. The population in this study were all 81 customers or customers of the Port Authority and Port Authority of Class II Pontianak consisting of representatives of shipping agents. Because the entire population will be researched, a census of the entire population of 81 shipping agents will be carried out. Sugiyono 2004), the pattern is a part of the range and traits possessed through the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sample taken in this study amounted to 81 respondents. Sampling in this study using the Census method where all populations are sampled. Obtained through a list of questions/statements submitted to respondents in this study. Data obtained from reports and databases that exist at the Port Authority and Class II Pontianak Port Authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Data collection techniques in this research are through, 1) Observation, conducting direct observations of the object under study, so that the data collected is more objective, 2) Interview, by holding questions and answers to the respondents of the Pontianak Class II Port Authority and Port Authority to obtain the required information, 3) Documentary study, from reports or documents relating to the object being examined.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Based on the data in Table 8, the multiplelinear regression equationmodelcan be formulated as follows: Y = 3,947 + 0,268 X1 + 0,193 X2 – 0,009 X3 + 0,321 X4 + 0,077 X5</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From this equation it can be described: i) Constant = 3,947. This shows a constant level, where if the Tangible X1), Reliability X2), Responsiveness X3), Assurance X4) and Empathy X5) variables are 0, then customer satisfaction Y) on the Port Authority and Port Authority services Class II Pontianak amounted to 3,947. ii) The coefficient b1 X1) = 0.268. This shows that the Tangible variable X1) has a positive effect on Customer Satisfaction, or in other words, if the Tangible variable is increased, then the customer satisfaction of the Port Authority and Port Authority of Class II Pontianak will increase by 0.268 assuming the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">other variables are fixed. iii) The coefficient b2 X2) = 0.193. This shows that the Reliability X2) variable does not have a significant effectonCustomer Satisfaction, or in other words, if the Reliability variable increases, then the customer satisfaction has no effect. iv) The coefficient b3 X3) = -0.009. This shows that the Responsiveness variable X3) does not have a significant effecton Customer Satisfaction, or in other words, if the Responsiveness variable increases, then the customer satisfaction has no effect. v) The coefficient b4 X4) = 0.321. This shows that the Assurance variable X4) has a positive effect on Customer Satisfaction, or in other words, if the Assurance variable increases, then the customer satisfaction of the Port Authority and Port Authority of Class II Pontianak will increase by 0.321 assuming other variables remain. vi) The coefficient of b5 X5) = 0.077. This shows that the Empathy variable X5) does not have a significant effecton Customer Satisfaction, or in other words, if the Empathy variable increases, then the customer satisfaction has no effect.</span></p>
