<p><span class="font4">Within the development of tourism in the era of new normality, especially for cultural tourism activities which do not only place tourists merely as spectators or connoisseurs, creative tourism is the main destination for alternative tourism, which is expected to maximize the potential for creative tourism for cultural advancement. The main objective of this study is to determine the position based on creative tourism to actualize the cultural advancement in the Yogyakarta Special Region and the Borobudur Temple Area. This study uses a qualitative research method with a case study approach with locations in the Yogyakarta Special Region and the Borobudur Temple area, Magelang Regency. Data collection techniques are carried out by observation and literature study, with a qualitative data analysis model based on theories of tourism development. The results of the research study show that the current stage of the development of creative tourism in the era of new normality in the Province of Yogyakarta Special Region and the Borobudur Temple Area, Magelang Regency is in between the consolidation of involvement between the industrial world and the stakeholders and the development of innovative products for cultural advancement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Keywords</span><span class="font4">: creative tourism, new normality, cultural advancement</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nowadays, tourists have changed their tourism journey from buying products into buying experiences. Furthermore, there has been a change from mass tourism into responsible tourism. This tourism model has developed from the mass tourism model that only goes to a destination to take pictures and pay the destination a visit. In the next development, more tourists have been traveling to a destination to learn more about the local community, for example they are now visiting art galleries</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and festivals, tourist villages, museums, historical buildings and many other activities that will give them more experiences while traveling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Development of the creative economy nowadays still faces many problems, challenges, and obstacles. The Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy of Indonesia came up with Rencana Induk Ekonomi Kreatif: New Indonesian Powers through 2025 that has identified seven main issues that will be new challenges for the development of creative economy, which are creative human resources, materials, industrial com-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">petitiveness, finance, market, infrastructure and technology, institutional and business climate. In this global economy challenge, the government has been trying to support the development of the creative industry to become the strategic sector that will play a bigger role into the national economy especially to contribute more for the GDP (gross domestic product), job creations and exports. Many new policies for this development have been made, and some of them have been prioritized for the development of the creative economy as written in RPJM Nasional 2015-2019, which also established the Creative Economy Agency that will especially see through the development for the creative economy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to Prince (2011); Richards (2011); Marques (2012); Richards and Marques (2012); Lee and Lee (2015) some experts, there have been many requests related to tourism products, including creativity based tourism, or better known as creative tourism. The term creative tourism (</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">creative based tourism</span><span class="font5">) has gained a place in the answer in an economy filled with creative elements from destinations that have led to innovations in its development. According to the creative friendly by tourism network states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Creative Tourism is considered a new generation of tourism that involves the tourists themselves and the locals in the creation of the tourist product (co-creati-on).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the terminology above, the experts consider creative tourism to be a new generation of tourism which involves the tourists themselves and local residents in the manufacture of tourism products (cocreation).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The growth and development of the creative economy at present, especially in tourist destinations such as Yogyakarta, means that tourism can not be separated from creative economy activities. As an example, the tourist activities in Yogyakar-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ta, especially at shopping centers like the culinary industry; gudeg, bakpia, geplak and others are scattered in the center of traditional foods. In addition, shopping tourism centers, such as Beringharjo Market and Malioboro, are the centers of creative industries that have become shopping destinations. This shopping tourism destination is a place for buying many handicraft or craft products. Looking at those examples, it is determined that the role of the creative economy is the most important part of tourism and can not be separated from tourism destinations and tourist activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to Swesty (2019) the structure of the relationship between the creative economy is very much related for self-development as in the following explanation.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/71453-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:207pt;height:78pt;">
<p><span class="font5">Figure 1. Self Development Requirement Stages. Source: Richards and Wilson (2007) (modified).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The requirements for basic human needs are: needing, wanting, having and behaving in which if those are juxtaposed into tourism types (mass tourism, cultural tourism and creative tourism), will result into another type of needs. According to Richards and Wilson (2007) the fulfillment of the basic needs are mass tourism to meet basic needs, creating distinctions is the purpose for cultural tourism, and then self development is the purpose for creative tourism. The emergence of creative tourism has been influenced by the changing of tourism motivation that will raise creative activities with active participants as an activity that will improve one’s skills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many countries like New Zealand,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">America, Austria, Spain, Canada, Taiwan and even Thailand have provided creative tourism activities as one of their tourism attractions. In Indonesia, creative tourism has not developed optimally even though it could be found easily in a lot of destinations, one of them are in Yogyakarta and Borobudur temple area. These two locations are very dominant in tourism development also as an effort to meet the supply of the creative industry as a trading commodity. But, even with creative tourism activities, Yogyakarta’s reputation as a cultural city and Borobudur temple as a nation-wide heritage, these areas are still unable to develop properly. In the end, creative tourism has not been able to be a tourism that can afford creative industry products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Talking about the creative industry in Yogyakarta and the Borobudur area which has unique industrial centers and is spread across four districts andcity and Bantul Regency is a district that has the most crafts compared to other districts which can be seen in the figure below which includes Yogyakarta City, Sleman Regency, Bantul Regency, Kulonprogo Regency and Gu-nungkidul Regency.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/71453-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:207pt;height:135pt;">

<p><span class="font5">According to the description above, several research questions that will be explored in this study are: How is the creative tourism development in Yogyakarta during</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the pandemic? And what are the factors (internal and external) that influence the creative tourism development in Yogyakarta and Borobudur area?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">METHODS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This research will use a case approach method (</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">case study research</span><span class="font5">). The research approach with the case study method is carried out intensively, in detail, and in depth on an individual, institution or certain symptoms with symptoms or narrow areas (Arikunto in Gunawan, 2016). This research is intended to formulate a form of creative tourism development in Yogyakarta and the Borobudur area. Types and sources of data and data collection methods are grouped into two types, namely primary data and secondary data as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The technique for data collecting was done with interview and observation to obtain primary data. The interview was conducted in a semi-structured interview, using a list of questions that have been prepared and planned in advance. In this interview model, informants were asked for</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">their opinions or ideas, because the purpose of this interview was to find problems more openly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The data collection technique is carried out by sampling technique through-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">snowball sampling</span><span class="font5">by targeting who is the target, among others: tourists, craftsmen, heads of UPT, cooperatives, the Office of Cooperatives, UKM and Industry, Department of Tourism, and BPS, secondary data is obtained through literature study , literature, data in the form of sources of research results and publications through journals, books, research reports related to creative industries, creative tourism or destination development models.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Internal factors that affect tourism development are attractions or tourist attractions in the process of making pottery and batik in 2019 and making visits. At that time, tourists were not interested in visiting. Next, many tourists are interested in buying products and other creative industry</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">goods. During its development, many tourists are interested in witnessing the making of written batik, pottery and other industries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The process of making hand-written batik and pottery by tourists, involves active participation of tourists, there is interaction between local people and tourists because they act as guides. There is a cultural exchange both in terms of language and experience when interactions occur. In the end, tourists will gain new knowledge and experiences from the results of creative tourism as a result of production tours of making pottery. This context can provide the most important feedback in efforts to promote local culture.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Accessibility</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Indonesia has the potential for a world-class tourism industry by utilizing the wealth of tourism in a sustainable manner. Indonesia is one of the habitats with the largest biodiversity in the world. Indonesia also has a variety of tourism which is an attraction for tourists. The World Economic Forum (WEF) Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017 ranked Indonesia 14 (out of 136 countries) for its rich natural resources and 23rd for cultural resources and business travel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The accessibility system aims to improve the quality of the road network, provide public transportation and nonmotorized means at the program location, and improve access to basic services and infrastructure that are important for tourists’ satisfaction in enjoying the tour experience. This aims to improve the infrastructure needed for the preservation of natural and cultural wealth. The results of observations whether or not to improve the quality of infrastructure include components consisting of: There are external factors con-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The third external factor that affects the development of tourism in Yogyakarta and the Borobudur area is the role of institutions (government, private sector and universities), and art traders from abroad (</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">buyers</span><span class="font5">). The first factor based on the analysis is the influence of several creators and observers of culture. Another factor is the existence and role of government, private and university institutions. The identification of the roles of these various institutions can be seen in the following Table 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another external factor that influences the development of the creative industry in the Yogyakarta region at this time or the new norm is the existence of art traders from abroad. Originally, these foreign art traders were tourists who came to visit Ka-songan. They buy creative industries which are then attractive to their colleagues, and repeat purchases occur until they see prospects and business opportunities. They started to buy more and even used container trucks, along with a graph of the development of elements of export and import of the creative industry</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The presence of art traders (exporters) from abroad has influenced the creativity of craftsmen to produce products that suit the tastes of foreign markets. Ceramic</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">crafts that function as table chairs in cylindrical, rectangular, hexagonal, and octagonal shapes decorated with primitive-style scratching techniques and plant motifs are produced for Australia, Korea, Japan and Canada. The jars with the motifs of the moon, star and smiling sun are in great demand by the European, Australian and Canadian markets as part of sales preparations for Christmas and summer holidays.In the 2000s, western society liked statues with traditional-spiritual values.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several factors in tourism development trends also affect tourism development, some interviews revealed that there is a shift in traditional cultural trends starting with visits made to local communities, cultural sites and historic cities until this trend shifts to tourist participation in creative activities or events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are internal factors in the development of creative tourism in the new era that can shape creativity to attract creative tourism, namely; creative individual, creative environment, creative product and creative process. There is a process of cultural exchange both in terms of language and experience during interactions between tourists and creative industry creators in gaining new knowledge and experiences from the results of creative tourism, so as to provide the most important feedback in efforts to promote local culture.There are obstacles to these external factors in the development of the creative industry, including: poor access, quality of services and infrastructure for the community, visitors and entrepreneurs, limited skills of labor and tourism services from the private sector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The stage of the development of creative tourism in the new normal era in Yogyakarta and the Borobudur Temple Area, Magelang Regency is at the stage of consolidation of involvement between the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">industrial world and stakeholders and the development of innovative products for cultural advancement.</span></p>
