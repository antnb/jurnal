<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of the Study</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">English movies can motivate some students to learn vocabularies and understand English better. As King (2002) states “films provide more pedagogical options and are a rich resource of intrinsically motivating materials for learners”. When students are exposed to movies, they can learn some words and phrases used</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">in the movies and by using subtitled movies, students can learn how to pronounce many words, and also help them to acquire new vocabulary and idioms. The use of subtitled movies may be effective to improve the reading and listening comprehension, word recognition and vocabulary acquisition of students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Watching subtitled movies may result in acquiring various types of language properties, in addition to word meanings, one may learn the situations in which these words may be used. There may also be improvement in the ability to discern separate words in the flow of spoken language, word pronunciation, and proficiency in constructing correct sentences.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">For the method of collecting data, a direct observation by using questionnaire and test were used in this study. And for the technique of collecting data, the students were given a pre-test in order to know the participants’ ability before they watch the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">movie, they were given a test of vocabulary in a form of vocabulary recognition and multiple choices tests related to the movie. After that, the students watched 20 minutes of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘Hotel Transylvania’</span><span class="font2"> with bimodal subtitling. And after watching the movies, the students were given the same tests as before related to the movies and to complete in 5 minutes. After the students completed the second tests, they watched the video again for 20 minutes but this time with standard subtitling. And after the movies played, the students were given the same tests as before related to the movies and to complete in 5 minutes. These tests had to be done to find out the improvement of English vocabulary of the students using the subtitled movies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The data of this study were taken from 10 of the third grade students of SMAK Santo Yoseph Denpasar. They are both male and female and most of them had been learning English since elementary school. They were selected based on their ability in English and their background where all of them were using English as a second language. </span><span class="font1">The instrument of the research was taken from the movie used in this study. The title of the movie is ‘</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hotel Transylvania’</span><span class="font1">. ‘</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hotel Transylvania</span><span class="font1">’ is a 2012 American</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_film"><span class="font1"> 3D </span></a><span class="font1">computer-animated comedy film produced by</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Animation"><span class="font1"> Sony Pictures Animation </span></a><span class="font1">and distributed by</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures"><span class="font1"> Columbia Pictures.</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">The data of this study were analyzed using the quantitative method and qualitative method. The quantitative method was used since the data is presented by using tables and numbers. The qualitative method was used in order to describe the result of the data shown in the tables. After the data were collected, the data from the tests were corrected to know the result of the tests. The ways to analyze the result of the test are as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">a.</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The score of each students were calculated using the following formula:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Number of correct answer(s)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Means = x 100%</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Number of question</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">b.</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mean score of the whole students were calculated using the following formula:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The Total Score of the Students</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Means =</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">x 100%</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Total Number of the Students</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then the result of the first test was compared with the result of the second and the third test in order to know the difference of the students’ ability before and after they watched the English movies. After the data were analyzed, they were presented in the form of table consisting of the score of correct answer and score of incorrect answer. The result of the research is presented in the form of graph as well in order to know the improvement of the vocabulary made by the students.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font2">Graph 1. The result of vocabulary recognition tests</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/8816-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:408pt;height:174pt;">
<p><span class="font2">The graph above shows that all of the students gained an improvement in</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">learning vocabulary. It can be seen that every students’ graph of score increased in every test. On the pre-test, the purpose of the test was to see the ability of the students before they watched the movie. The result shows that the score of the students was in average score. All students got more than 50% correct answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the 1<sup>st</sup> post-test, all students showed an improvement and could answer more than 80% of the questions. It was because on the 1<sup>st</sup> post-test, the movie was played and used bimodal subtitling (L2 audio with L2 subtitles). In this stage, the students have already knew what words used in the test, so they were aware and paid more attention to the subtitles when they watched the movie. When the word appeared on the subtitles, the students saw the visual cues of the words in the movie, so they could guess what the meaning of each word was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the 2<sup>nd</sup> post-test, the movie was played again and it used standard subtitling (L2 Audio with L1 subtitles) before the test get started. By using standard subtitling, the students were able to know the meaning of the words more clearly since the subtitles were using L1. It can be seen on the graph that the students showed more improvement in learning vocabulary on the 2<sup>nd</sup> pos-test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Graph 2. The result of multiple choice tests</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/8816-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:407pt;height:175pt;">
<p><span class="font2">The graph above shows the result of the three multiple choice tests done by the students. It can be seen that in the multiple choice test, the students showed more improvement. In the pre-test, the students answered 35%-80% of the questions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">correctly, and it extremely raised to 85%-90% in the 1<sup>st</sup> post-test. And in the 2<sup>nd</sup> posttest, all of the students answered all the questions correctly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Graph 3. Mean score of the pre-test, 1<sup>st</sup> post-test and 2<sup>nd</sup> post-test</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/8816-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:412pt;height:156pt;">
<p><span class="font2">The graph above showed the vocabulary improvement of the students. The graph also showed that the mean score of the tests got higher after the students watched the movie. So it can be said that subtitled movie helped students to get new vocabulary. The mean results of the second post-test were higher than the results of the first post-test. In the first post-test, the students watched the movie with bimodal subtitling and the movie was played with L2 audio and L1 subtitles. Then, the movie was played again with standard subtitling in the second post-test. It seemed that the students were able to understand the vocabulary easier after watching the movie for the second time and by using the standard subtitling.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The Effectiveness of Subtitled Movie in Learning Vocabulary</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">The effectiveness of using subtitles to learn new vocabulary found in this study, the respondents of the research learned and acquired new vocabulary after they watched the movie with subtitles. Two types of subtitling, bimodal and standard subtitling, were given to the respondents, and it appeared that after watching the movie more than once and used those two different types of subtitling, the respondents gained more vocabulary effectively. Koolstra and Beentjes (1999)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">claimed that students had to watch a subtitled movie with high frequency for learning vocabulary from it. Or it can be said that subtitled movies could have an effect on vocabulary recognition if the learners watched the movie more than once. Watching the movie twice or more may help students recognize new vocabulary and they may also learn new idioms and expressions. Moreover, watching subtitled movie more than once might also develop other skills of the students, such as reading or listening comprehension, and even pronunciation. Therefore, watching English movies with subtitles is actually can be an effective method to improve the English vocabulary.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the result of the research in SMAK Santo Yoseph, and other evidence found in some empirical studies, there is no doubt that video technology especially subtitled movie can be a powerful teaching tool to help students learn and acquire new vocabulary. According to Baltova (1999), as the video technology changes at a galloping speed, our options today are certainly not limited to traditional video cassettes only, although they still seem to be the most practical and accessible resource in many schools. It is inevitable, of course, that more advanced technological video, such as interactive video CD, DVD, CD-ROM, Blu-Ray, and web-based multimedia courseware will become increasingly more popular aids in both inside and outside the classroom, since those technological resources allow the students to choose the subtitles.</span></p>
