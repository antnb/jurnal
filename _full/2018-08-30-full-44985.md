  - "TRPA1 is expressed highly in content compared to NSCLC and normal patients. TRPA1 holds an important role in many SCLC cell viability mechanisms. Continuous activation of TRPA1 will mediate the increase of Ca2+ influx into cancer cell thus causing an increase in SCLC progressivity. In other words"
  - "inhibition of TRPA1 will obstruct the process of Ca2+ influx into the cell which is followed by induction of apoptosis along with inhibition of metastasis"
  - "angiogenesis"
  - "also progressivity of SCLC. Conclusion: TRPA1 is expressed in a significant numbers in SCLC cell"
  - "this ion canal can be used as a promising therapeutic intervention target in the future."
