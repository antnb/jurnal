<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Brahmândha Purâna or Kakawin Pretu Wijaya is a kakawin which contains the story of a very cruel king named King Wena</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">His government was featured by cruelties. The advices given by his ancestors and the priests were always neglected. He defied every religious teaching introduced to him. When the priests advised him, he challenged them instead of listening to them. As a result, a war took place between the priests and king Wena. When the priests were pressured, they hit his arm, causing it be pregnant and a son named Pretu was born. Therefore, his full name was PŗtuWijaya</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">who was then crowned the king. The story was continued with the names of highly beautiful mounts, lakes and places located in the territory of Baratawarsa The study was intended to spread the educational values which the kakawin contains which can be used as guidance by the young generation. Apart from that, the study was also intended to document the story. The theory used in the current study is the theory of literary deconstruction developed by J. Darrida. The research method used included data collection, data analysis and the descriptive presentation of the result of data analysis. The educational values which were found in Kakawin Brahmana Purana are as follows: the educational value of morality, the religious educational value, and the educational value of unity and oneness. It was composed in the era of the reign of I Dewa Agung Istri Kania, who governed the Klungkung kingdom. The fact which showed this was that the queen, Sri Prakerti Wiryya, who was old, is mentioned in the kakawin.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Education is defined as a process of changing the attitude and behavior of someone or a group of people through teaching and training; in other words, it is defined as a process or a way of educating someone (Moeliono, 2014: 326). In the Act of the Republic of Indonesia No. 12 of 2012 concerning Higher Education, education is defined as an attempt which is consciously needed and planned to create a learning atmosphere in which learners can</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">actively develop the potentials they need in order to have religious spiritual strength, self-control, personality, intelligence, great character, and the skills which they, their society, nation and state need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Brahmânda Purânâ</span><span class="font3">, as a classic literary work written in the Old Javanese language, contains many educational values such as the religious educational value, the character educational value, the educational value of unity and oneness, the educational</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">value of helping one another, and the educational value of environment. Every educational value will be explained as follows:</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>The Character Educational Value</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Character can be defined as a specific feature which an object or an individual has. Such a specific character is originally and strongly attached to the object or individual, and a “machine” which activates someone to act and behave. It is also a “machine” which activates someone to utter and respond to something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Character education can be simply defined as every attempt made to affect the learner’s character; or, it can also be simply defined as something which can help someone understand, pay attention to, and implement the essential ethic values.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Suyanto &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2009) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Belajarpsikologi.com, 2012) defines character education as a way of thinking and behaving in such a way that such a way of thinking and behaving can specifically feature every individual’s way of life and way of working with others within his/her family, society, country and state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In general, human personality can be defined into four; they are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being choleric; it is a type of personality featured by being fond of being independent, firm, and furious, welcoming challenges, and controlling him/herself.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being sanguine; someone with this type of character generally likes practical things; he/she is generally delighted and cheerful, likes surprisesand social activities and having fun.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being phlegmatic; someone with this type of character usually likes working together and avoiding conflict, andlikes certain things; she/he does</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">not like sudden changes, but he/she is good to talk to.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being melancholic; someone with this type of character usually likes detailed things, clear instructions, regular activities; he/she does not like showing his/her anger; he/she is a perfectionist as well (Alwisol, 2006: 198).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Character building needs a specific and accurate method in order to achieve its goal. The learning methods which can be chosen are the exemplifying method, the method of making what is taught a habit, and the method of reward and punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Much character building can be found in the traditional literary works, especially in the ones written in the Old Javanese language. Some literary works written in the Old Javanese language are in the form of poems ‘kakawin’, some are in the forms of spiritual hymns ‘kidung’ and the others are in the form of prose as exemplified by the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">parwa</span><span class="font3"> texts and speeches. One of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kakawins</span><span class="font3"> which contain character education is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Brahmândha Purâna</span><span class="font3"> (abbreviated to KBP).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is narrated in Kakawin Brahmândha Purâna that good deeds defeat cruelty. Having a son with a great character and who is educated and pious to the Almighty God is a happiness which can elevate the dignity of parents, nation and state. Therefore, character education is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Brahmânda Purâna</span><span class="font3"> is a literary work written in the Old Javanese language, which narrates a king named Wena. He governed cruelly, did not have affection, got angry easily, did not believe in God and did not have any sense of humanity. He destroyed all the holy places. Religious teaching and worshipping God were prohibited, causing the priests to see king Wena or king Sunilatmaja.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The priests, whom were led by the Priest Anggira, came to see king Wena to give him advice. However, when the group of the priests met him, he condemned, humiliated and challenged them to fight. The priests got angry and attacked the king. When the king’s left arm was hit by the priests, a giant named </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Nisada</span><span class="font3">, who looked eerie and frightening, appeared. The priests asked Nisada to reside at the edge of a forest located in the slope of Mount Windia. Then the king’s right arm was hit again, a handsome baby appeared. The baby looked like Lord Prajapati (Brahma). The baby immediately grew up and became an adult. He was named Sang Pŗtu. When the baby was born, king Wena died. As when the king was alive he was cruel, his soul went to Hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">King Wena was replaced by his son named king Pŗtu, who governed very wisely and was very generous. He was very powerful and everything he did always referred to the truth ‘dharma’ and religion. He developed the country by building holy places, schools and public facilities. He paid attention to the people’s welfare. As he always praised the truth ‘dharma’ and ethics ‘susila’ he was referred to as PŗtuWijaya or a successful king. It was that which led king Wena to leave Hell and go to Heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If what was narrated above was well observed, it can be stated that a pious person always refers to religion, law, and divinity. Such a child will be able to lead his/her parents to the real happiness (Heaven), as pictured by what was done by King PŗtuWijaya which could lead the soul of his father, namely King Wena, to Heaven, as can be seen from Pupuh II of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Wirat Kalengengan</span><span class="font3"> as follows. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prajapȃti sirȃnurun ring halȇping muka saha kawacanya tan hilang, Dudū lawani sang yayahnira ta dharmmanira minaki cittaning sarȃt,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kawrȇdyanira dharma mūrti sahananya tȇkapi narendra wiryyawȃn,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ya teka lumpas pranȃntikani sang bapa mulih ing acintya sūnyata</span><span class="font3"> (stanza 3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Samangkana tinȇmwade sang atibȃgya phalani awkȃti dharmika,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kasor saphalaning mayadña yaṡa pūnyȃ saphalaning atirthayatra ya,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ikang sakala niskala pwa phalaning tumȇmu phala suputra digjaya, Apan wȇnang ika swadharmma ya umȇntasa halaning adharma duskrȇta </span><span class="font3">(stanza 4</span><span class="font2">).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The translation is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The shirt he is wearing and his handsomeness make him look like the personification of Lord Brahma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Unlike his father, who was cruel, he always does good deeds and makes other happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He always spreads what is taught by religion (dharma) in different forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is what he has done leads which his father to leave Hell for Heaven (3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is that type of reward that will be received by someone whose son is wise. Such a reward defeats the reward for having sacrificed something, for having done good deeds, for being generous, and for having made pilgrimage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Someone who has a wise son will receive a reward which can be either tangible or intangible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is only what is true ‘dharma’/ethical behavior which can free what is not good “adharma’/cruelty and evilness (4).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is very clear that what is stated in the second strophes suggests that people should teach their children to be polite, behave ethically, and what they do should always refer to religious teaching, law and divinity. Being pious to the Almighty God and His teachings will make children or learners the ones who</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">are loyal to their parents and God and always behave ethically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What was illustrated in the two strophes is also mentioned in pupuh IV stanza 1 and pupuh IX stanza 4 of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Nitīșâstra</span><span class="font3"> as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sanghyang candra tarȃngganȃ pinaka dipa mȇmadangi ri kȃla wȇngi, Sanghyang Surya sȇdȇng prabhasa makadipa mȇmadangi ri bhumi mandala, Widyȃ ṡȃstra sudharmma dipa nikanang tribhuwana sumȇnȍ prabhȃswara, Yan ing putra suputra sȃdhu gunawȃn mȇmadangi kula wandhuwandhawa (pupuh IV stanza 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yaṡa kīrti karmakȇna denta tan hȇlȇm hȇlȇmeka ṡighranȇn, gawayȇn ikang tȃlaga tunggal amada magawe sumur satus, magaweki tȃlaga satus wilang ika pada pinra sakrama, mapadeki labhaning aputra sawiji gunamanta sȃdhana (pupuh IX stanza 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The translation is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The moon and stars are the light which illuminate the dark night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The sun, when it shines, is the light which illuminates the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Knowledge, lesson, and education of wisdom are the light which illuminates the third world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A wise, intelligent and morally great son will be able to illuminate his family and friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Meritorious service and good reputation should be immediately made, meaning that do not postpone to give meritorious service, and to make good reputation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The meritorious service given by someone who builds a pool is the same as the meritorious service given by someone who makes one hundred wells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The meritorious service given by someone who builds a pool is the same as the meritorious service given by someone who performs a sacrificial ceremony for his/her fellow human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These are all identical with the benefit received by someone who has a wise son as the key to achieving hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The analysis is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A well-behaved, knowledgeable, and noble child is identical with the moon and stars which illuminate the dark night, and with the sun which shines during day time. In Hinduism, such a child is referred to as ‘anak yang suputra’ (a great child). He/she will be able to lead his/her parents and even his/her ancestors to finding happiness and to make his/her friends have good reputations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having a son with good morality is better than giving alms, building one hundred pools and digging ten thousand wells. He/she will be able to raise his/her parents and friends and to lead the souls of his/her parents to Heaven. Knowledge, ethics and religion should be taught to him/her as early as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Basically, moral education includes the education of great character through which learners are expected to have good character,be religious, honest and tolerant, work hard, be creative, independent, democratic and curious, love the nation and the fatherland, appreciate achievement, be communicative and friendly, love peace, like reading, and be aware of environment, and responsible. The objective of moral education is to make individuals more perfect perceptually and train themselves to be getting better. Within the current context, moral education is relevantly applied as the solution to the moral degradation or moral crisis which is currently taking place in our country. The moral crisis is indicated by the facts that more and more</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">people are involved in free sex, the increase in the number of children and young people who are involved in violence, more and more people are involved in crimes, robbery, plagiarism, narcotics abuse, pornography, and the increase in the number of people who destroy others’/government’s belongings, which cannot be totally overcome yet. Such facts show that moral education is very importantly implanted to the young generation. If moral education can be implanted to leaners, then the young generation will be able to create unity for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Pancasila</span><span class="font3">-based Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia. Therefore, it is necessary to teach the moral educational value which KBP contains to learners or our children.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Religious Educational Value</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">agama</span><span class="font3"> means “believe in God; the supernatural power over human beings. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">keagamaan</span><span class="font3"> means being religious, being related to religion (Moliono et al., 2014: 1159).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">KBP as a classic literary work written in the Old Javanese language is highly rich in the religious educational value. It contains religious teaching, especially Hinduism. In the beginning it is narrated that king Wena was a cruel king. He opposed the religious teaching; as a result, the priests fought against him. He was killed by his son named Sang Pŗtu; His soul went to Hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then it is narrated that king Pŗtu had great character and was generous. His generosity made him offer all his properties to his people. One day he was visited by so many priests that he could not serve them all, causing him to be frustrated and angry. Being angry, he intended to destroy the earth (symbolized by Goddess Pŗtiwi) for being unjust. Finally, Goddess Pŗtiwi, descended to earth and gave fertility, making the king able to serve all the priests and his</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">kingdom fertile. His people were prosperous, causing the king not to be angry any longer. Goddess Pŗtiwi, as the goddess of fertility, was known in Hinduism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the end of KBP several holy places in Hinduism are mentioned, one of which is the peak of Mount Kailasa, where Lord Ciwa is believed to reside. He is one of the Lords of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Trimurti</span><span class="font3"> which is highly honored in Hinduism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Apart from that, the Gangga River, which is considered holy in Hinduism, is also mentioned. The other rivers mentioned are Serayu River, Yamuna River, Saraswati River, and Sindu River. Pupuh 1 stanza 1 and 2 :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Om Sanghyang Paramārtha çunya wēkas ing sūksmā wibhūh wiryyawān, manggēh munggwi ring antapadma ginēlar dening çiwānggottama, sang māwak daçamurtti aṣthatanu ring pūjādi yoga smrēti, ring rūpādi akāra Om ring ujaring çastrāti sūksmeniwō.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">The translation is as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the Almighty God, you’re the real truth, supernatural, great and the almighty. You always reside on the lotus and are symbolized as Lord SiwaMahautama. When you’re worshipped using what is referred to as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">yoga semadiutama</span><span class="font3">, you’re an eight-bodied Dasamurti. You’re in the form of the main character A, which is pronounced A in the secret worshipping literary work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Excellency is the only essence of knowledge, and is the source of everything which is alive. Your Excellency is also in the three paths leading to what is referred to as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">moksa</span><span class="font3">(redemption) where the successful great Hindu priests ‘yogi’ intend to go. Being born, being alive, and being dead are the cycle of life which comes to an end with death, and this cycle of life should be followed. Your Excellency is the gate of emptiness which is greatly esteemed as the way to heaven.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God is stated to be the form of the real truth. The truth only belongs to God. God is also pictured as the most Mysterious, the Greatest, and the Almighty. Nothing can compare His greatness and almighty. He resides within the human heart, symbolized as what is referred to as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">antapadma</span><span class="font3"> or the essence of the lotus. His almighty can be seen from His nature of becoming the Creator, the Protector, and the Destroyer. God causes everything to be born, live and die. Everything that is born and lives on earth will return to where they come from, namely God the Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The text also contains the religious educational value especially the holy sacrificial ceremony for ancestors apart from the religious educational value described above. The goal is that the souls of ancestors are welcome in Heaven, as reflected by the following Pupuh III stanza 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mangke çrī naranātha yajňa dinamēl nira ati çāya dibya tan sipi, Prēttā yajňa ngaranya yajňa nira sang prabhu ginēlar ira ya tākrama, Kāla çri naranātha kinwam angucur miňa kulih ira sang yajāmaṇa, Ngke çruha minantra de nira yajur çruti tēkap ira sang mahāmuni.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The translation is as follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is narrated that after he was appointed king, he performed a holy sacrificial ceremony ‘yadnya’ which had never been performed by others. It had been well prepared and was prepared for the ancestors. At that time the king was requested to spread holy oil by the priest. The oil was placed in a bowl and the prayers of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yajur Weda Sruti</span><span class="font3"> were recited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The above couplet shows how a child respects his ancestors through a holy sacrificial ceremony ‘yadnya’. The ceremony consists of offerings and prayers. The goal is that the ancestors are properly resided in hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on what was described above, it can be concluded that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Brahmânda Pŭr</span><span class="font3">ana teaches its readers the religious education.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Unity and Oneness Value</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">What is meant by the unity and oneness value in this current study is that the couplets of the text contain the elements which are used to invite everybody to help one another in order to achieve a specific goal. In this case, togetherness means unity and oneness. Basically, unity means a combination (association, collection) of several parts of something which have already become united, and oneness means something which is one and almighty (Moeliono, 2014: 1231).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Brahmândha Purâna</span><span class="font3"> is a literary work written in the Old Javanese language, where it is narrated that the priests descended to earth to advise king Wena, who was bad and wicked. However, the king did not listen to and neglected the priests, causing them to be angry. King Wena also became angry. Then the priests attacked the king together, as they recognized that if they had not attacked the king together, they would have been defeated</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">by the king. The king had such a magical power that the priests were forced to get united to defeat him. The success achieved by the priests in defeating the king can be seen from the following strophes:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nāhan ling naranātha wena ati bangḡā mūrka mohanaput, wetning tan kawēnang kumola tēkap i angkara wenā dhipa, ngkā ta kroda madēg mahāŗṣi wēkasan makrak masinghā krēti, kapwekā rumēbut rumēnggut nikēp sang nātha wus kagraha.

<p><span class="font3">The translation is as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was uttered by king Wena, showing that he was arrogant, rebellious, and greedy, resulting from his inability to show his anger. Then the priests became so angry that they cried as what lions did. They all kept going forward to catch king Wena; finally, he was caught.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Wena became angry; then he revenged on what had been done by the priests; he hit and threw the priests down forcefully, causing them to be stepped on. Everybody,who was in the meeting room, got frightened and ran away at top speed. Those who were at the trellis ran helter-shelter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the priests attacked king Wena again. However, the king did not go back; he ran amuck as an elephant which was fighting against a buffalo. He got stronger, hit, and kicked the priests repeatedly and choked their necks. At the same time the priests also choked the king’s neck and tufted his hair.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer they fought against one another, the more violent they became. They stabbed and threw one another down forcefully. The king’s hair became tangled as the fastener got totally loose, resulting from the long fighting. Finally, king Wena fell down and became the looser, and at</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">that time his left hand was hit by the greatest priest.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priests were made to be surprised by the sudden appearance of someone whose face was frightening. His head was very big and his body was so black as if it had been painted black. Finally, king Wena was suffering and urged the priests that they would not tortured him any longer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The above couplets of the text clearly teach that unity and oneness are highly needed in order to have strength. The philosophy of the broom of split coconut midribs exemplifies this. If they are tied together, they will form a broom. Before they are tied together, they do not have any strength to sweep any rubbish. The meaning is that, as social beings, it is impossible for human beings to live individually. One needs another as a partner to socialize and exist. One cannot exist without any partner.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The Environmental Educational Value</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Environment refers to everything in the human surrounding and mutual relationship between man and everything surrounding him. According to the Act Number 23 of 1997, environment means the unity between space and all objects, resources, condition and living creatures, including human beings whose behavior directly contributes to their way of living and welfare, and the way of living and welfare of other creatures. The scope of the Indonesia’s environment includes space and the archipelago-oriented territory of the Unitary Country of Indonesia, as far as the implementation of its sovereignty and jurisdiction are concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this current study environment refers to the value which </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Brahmândha Purâana</span><span class="font3"> contains. It is instructed to appreciate, pay attention to, and preserve the human surrounding, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">not to degrade the eco-system when making use of and managing environment. Human beings, giants, priests and gods should pay attention to and manage the surrounding nature to make it more beautiful and useful to every creature without degrading the nature so that the eco-system can be sustained. Almost all contents of the text show this. Exploiting excessively without preserving the natural resources is strongly prohibited in the text, as can be seen from the narration that King Pŗtuwijaya ran after and intended to kill Goddess Pertiwi as he did not have enough foods to serve the priests when they came to visit him at his palace. The king was getting embarrassed as he did not have enough foods to serve the priests as all his properties had been given to those who needed them as alms. Being unable to serve the priests caused him to be embarrassed. The king threatened Goddess Pertiwi that she had to prepare the food stuffs and clothing for the priests. Finally, she fulfilled his request. She transformed herself into a female ox that supplied milk for everybody’s prosperity. People were taught how to engage in farming, make handicrafts, trade, build houses, study ethics/religion and so forth which contribute to the people’s and other creatures’ welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The stories narrated in the form of couplets in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kakawin Brahmândha Purâana</span><span class="font3"> are all symbolic, meaning that they need to be interpreted. As an illustration, the description describing that the king intended to kill Goddess Pertiwi implicitly means that the king intended to exploit environment. Goddess Pertiwi symbolizes environment or earth. People are obliged not to make use of or exploit Mother Earth (environment including the land) cruelly and excessively. If environment is excessively exploited, the nature will</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">become degraded (the death of Mother Earth). If the nature is destroyed, then destruction cannot be avoided, and vice versa. If the nature is well managed, then Mother Earth will give fertility and prosperity, as can be seen in the following couples.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Excellency is very wise. He always manages, restores and organizes the nature surrounding him wisely. Therefore, he is referred to as the sovereign by everybody in his territory. His Excellency is the first king whom all the kings all over the world are proud of. All gods love him as he is highly devoted to God, especially Lord Siwa.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he talks at the seaside and enjoys the beautiful sea view, he passes by sea storm; however, he can walk as if he was waking on the mainland. When he wants to travel on the mainland where he can enjoy the beautiful view, the mount and the pile of earth hampering him become flat.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the country of His Excellency becomes safe and peaceful without any disaster during his reign. The prices of all products are cheap, the fish caught from the sea, and the agricultural products produced from the mount are sufficient. The rice grows well although nobody plants it. The milk squeezed keeps flowing as long as people need it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the country of His Excellency live happily and there is no disaster taking place. The people are free from taxes and the owners of the rice fields are too. No taxes are levied on the ministers both when they go out and go shopping. Therefore, the people respect and are faithful to him as the people’s protector.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">There are still many couplets in which the environmental educational value can be found. However, the above mentioned couplets exemplify enough. Therefore, it is not necessary to discuss the other couplets in this current study.</span></p>
