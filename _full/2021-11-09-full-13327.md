<p><span class="font14">ABSTRACT</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) has been intended to be a multi-purpose, multi-disciplinary oceanic modeling tool. The Biogeochemical model have coupled to ROMS consists of a system ofseven coupled partial differential equations that include: nitrate, ammonium, small and large detritus, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and a dynamic phytoplankton carbon to chlorophyll ratio. The study ofdistribution patterns ofchlorophyll-a in Lombok Strait (-7 °N - -10 °S and 114 °E - 117 °E) in 2006 was analyzed using the Biogeochemical model based on ROMS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The results show that low chlorophyll-a distributions (0.20 mgChl-a/m<sup>3</sup>) observed in Lombok Strait in January. Chlorophyll-a estimated around the southern part of Bali Strait and low chlorophyll-a distribution in upper layer of the Lombok Strait.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Chlorophyll-a ofthe booming (0.32 mgChl-a/m </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup>)</span><span class="font14"> observed in August. The northeast current direction moves to the west and southern part of research area through Lombok Strait. The highest chlorophyll-a concentration estimated in the northern and southwestern part of Bali Island and also in the southern part of Lombok Island. During dry monsoon, southeasterly wind blow from Australia generates upwelling process (low temperature and nutrient-rich water near the surface) also estimated from ROMS.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Chlorophyll plays an important role in plants in the photosynthesis, the mechanism by which plants acquire energy. In the photosynthesis process, all plants, including phytoplankton in the ocean, absorb C0<sub>2</sub>, so the ocean plays an important role in adjusting the C0<sub>2 </sub>concentration in the atmosphere. Ocean biogeochemical and ecosystem processes are linked by Net Primary</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Production (NPP) in the ocean's surface layer, where inorganic carbon is fixed by photosynthetic processes (Behrenfeld, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font14"> 2005).</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The vertical distribution patterns of chlorophyll concentration depend on seasons and regions. The chlorophyll maximum value is not always observed near or at the sea surface, but sometimes lies deeper than the bottom of the eupothic zone. In this case, the ocean color sensors cannot measure the chloro-</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">phyll maximum value (Parson </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">et</span><span class="font14"> al., 1984 in Pertami, 2006).</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Coastal environments are important biogeochemical pathways between land and the open ocean that significantly modify the flows of matter and energy between the latter two systems. They receive and exchange considerable amounts of dissolved and particulate organic matter and nutrients, freshwater, energy and contaminants (Smith and Hollibaugh, 1993; Gattuso </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font14"> 1998; Wollast, 1998 in Schiettecatte, 2006).</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In this study, the changes in the vertical distribution of chl-a concentration from the sea surface in Lombok strait were investigate using biogeochemical model based on Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS).</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Tlie first aim of this research is to know the change of the vertical distribution of chl-a concentration from the sea surface using ROMS with Biogeochemical Model. The second aim is to estimate the distribution of chl-a in Lombok Strait concerning with ITF and monsoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The result of this research can be giving an understanding of how the changed of the vertical distribution of chl-a concentration from the sea surface using ROMS with Biogeochemical Model and the distribution of chl-a in Lombok Strait concerning with ITF and monsoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The research was conducted in Lombok Strait (-7 <sup>o</sup>N ~ -10 <sup>o</sup>S and 114 <sup>0</sup>E ~ 117 <sup>o</sup>E). In-situ data recorded such as temperature, salinity, turbidity, chlorophyll concentration, and sigma-T (density) by COMPACT-CTD. In this study, the observed data (chl-a concentration, temperature, and salinity) are employed for the validation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The satellite data from SeaWIFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) were used in January to December 2006 for inputting directly into the biogeochemical model. The ocean color reveals information on the presence and concentration of phytoplankton, sediments, and dissolved organic matters of the ocean. Tlius, SeaWiFS can manage the marine environment (Chaomin </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font14"> 2001).</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The bathymetry data was taken from ETOPO-2. The data is a combination of satellite altimetry observations, shipboard echo-sounding measurements, data from the Digital Bathymetric Data Base Variable Resolution and data from the GLOBE project which has a global digital elevation model (SOS NOAA, 2009).</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The surface forcing data such as wind stress, long wave and short wave radiation, evaporation, and precipitation are from NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction). All of the data were analyzed</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">using ROMS. Finally, the model results compared to the in-situ data set and satellite data. The research scheme</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Data was analyzed using the Biogeochemical model of the ROMS (Moisan </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font14"> 2001). Tlie model equations is as the following:</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">During rainy season, the northwest current direction moves to the east and southern part through the Lombok Strait in January The highest chl-a values only estimated in the small area in the northwestern part of Java island and the lowest values (blue) estimated in the almost research area included the Lombok Strait. The maximum value of chl-a is 0.6 (mgChl-a/m<sup>3</sup>) and the minimum value is 0.1 (mgChl-a∕m<sup>3</sup>). The results derived from the model indicated that low chl-a distributions at the sea surface in Lombok Strait in January (Figure 2 (a)). The chl-a distribution is around 0.2 (mgChl-a∕m<sup>3</sup>). Many rivers change the value bring nutrients enter into the strait in coastal area. In the month (when the northwest monsoon happened), northwesterly wind drives the surface current to the east and southward and accumulates the warm water in the southeastern part of Lombok Strait to the Indian ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">During dry season, the northeast current direction moves to the west and southern part of research area through Lombok Strait in August. The highest chl-a values were estimated in the northern and southwestern part of Bali Island included in Lombok Strait and also in the southern part of Lombok Island. The lowest values estimated in the northern part of Lombok island. There is high chl-a distribution found in Lombok Strait at the sea surface (Figure 2 (b) in August (when the southeast monsoon happened). The chl-a distribution estimated in the strait is from 0.35 to 0.6 (mgChl-a∕m<sup>3</sup>). This indicated that chl-a booming in this month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The results derived from satellite SeaWIFS show similar patterns (Figure 2 (c) and Figure 2 (d)). High chl-a distribution observed in August, southeast monsoon happened. LiJanuarywarmertemperature caused</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">chl-a distribution decreased at the sea surface. On the contrary August pattern shows, decreasing temperature caused the chlorophyll-a distribution increase at the sea surface (Figure 5.4 and 5.5).</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Arvelyna, Y. and M. Oshima (2010) showed from April to August 2000 the chlorophyll increased at southern of East Java Island, Bali Island and Lombok Strait. The maximum concentration is located at southern coastline of Bali Island. InJuly, the area near coastline of Java is influenced by upwelling area occurs during east wind. The maximum chlorophyll area when internal wave did not occur on August in southern of Java Island. It shown that the surface chlorophyll concentration near coastal area, increased when internal wave is occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The highest temperature level values (dark red) in January estimated in almost part of the research area with the temperature is up to 29 <sup>0</sup>C and more. High temperature in January (up to 29 <sup>o</sup>C and more) is also influenced low chl-a distribution around Lombok Strait (Figure 3 (a)).</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The highest temperature (28 <sup>0</sup>C) in August estimated in the northern part of Bali Island included in Lombok Strait to Indian ocean and the lowest temperature (24 <sup>0</sup>C) estimated in the southern part of Bali Island (near the Bah Strait). In August, temperature range is from 25 to 28 <sup>o</sup>C (Figure 3 (b)).</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The results from satellite is also showed similar patterns. The highest temperature values (light red) were estimated in northern part of research area and the minimum values (blue to purple) estimated in the small area in southeastern part of Java Island. The variation of temperature in Lombok Strait in January is from 25 to 32 <sup>o</sup>C. In Lombok Strait temperature is 30 <sup>0</sup>C. The temperature in January 2006 in Lombok Strait is high (from 28 to 29 <sup>o</sup>C) and from 25 to 27 <sup>0</sup>C in August 2006 (Figure 3 (c) and Figure 3 (d)). The highest temperature value (Ught green) estimated in the northwestern part of Bab Island and the minimum value (purple) estimated in the southern part of research area. The maximum temperature value is 29 <sup>0</sup>C and the minimum value is 25 <sup>0</sup>C. Temperature variation of Lombok Strait is from 25 to 27 <sup>0</sup>C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Tomascik </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font14"> (1997) in Tubalawony (2001) showed that sea surface temperature in Indonesian seas is around 25 to 30 <sup>0</sup>C and decrease 1 to 2 <sup>0</sup>C in every 80 db depth. In January to February when the downwelling happened, temperature at the sea surface can reach up to 25 <sup>0</sup>C and in August when the upwelling happened, sea surface temperature is around 25 <sup>0</sup>C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Upwelling events were studied along the southern coast of Java, Bali and Lombok islands during the southeast monsoon (June to August). SateUite-derived chlorophyU concentrations higher than 0.8 (mgChl-a/ m<sup>j</sup>) and sea-surface temperatures lower than 28 <sup>o</sup>C are indications of upwe∏ing (Hendiarti </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font14"> 2004; Su-</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">The comparison monthly average of SST and chl-a distribution at the sea surface derived from the model shows that in January, warmer temperature at the sea surface is up to 29.18 <sup>0</sup>C with the chl-a distribution is 0.20 (mgChl-a∕m<sup>3</sup>). In August (Table 1), the temperature is up to 27.19 <sup>o</sup>C and the chl-a distribution at the sea surface is up to 0.32 (mgChl-a∕m<sup>3</sup>).</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The comparison of monthly average value of SST and chl-a at the sea surface from satellite data shows that warmer temperature at the sea surface is up to 29.77 <sup>0</sup>C with the chl-a distribution is 0.27 (mgChl-a/ m<sup>3</sup>) in January. The temperature is up to 26.34 <sup>o</sup>C and the chl-a at the sea surface is up to 0.66 (mgChl-a∕m<sup>3</sup>) in August (Table 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There were significant differences between monthly average value of chl-a distribution in August from satellite and the model. The differences occured because of upwelling events in August, which was indicated by the high value of chl-a. The data from satellite was usually higher than the model because of the reflectance could detect changes in the spectrum of light with the same wavelength. The data from the model was obtained from a formula without using any atmospheric model thus considered that the photosynthesis value was constant. It also was difficult to provide any significant value that was affected by monsoon.</span></p>

There are small area of chl-a distribution estimated in the Lombok Strait from layer 1 to layer 24. Chl-a is estimated to increase in the southern part of Bali Strait to the Indian Ocean in Layer 4 to 12. Chl-a distributions are estimated to decrease until the bottom of the sea.

<p><span class="font3">The comparison of chl-a vertical distribution which derived from model and insitu dataset in Lombok Strait are devided into four different locations. In all location (Al, L3, LS and LB3), chl-a distribution almost found at the sea surface until 100 m depth (as mixing area) with the range value is from 0.5 to 1.0 (mgChl-a/ m<sup>3</sup>). This shows that in October and December 2006 (when the data were taken), the distribution of chl-a in upper l</span><span class="font1">ay</span><span class="font3">er is high. The temperature in this upper layer is from 25 to 28 °C. This mean that this temperature is the tolerance temperature for the chl-a to live in Lombok Strait.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ch.I-a and temperature distribution from in-situ dataset was used to validate the model results. Figure 10 (a) and (b), 11 (a) and (b), 12 (a) and Figure 13 (a) and (b) show correlation between model and in-situ in each location (Al, L3, LS, and LB3).</span></p>
