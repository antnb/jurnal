<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract: The Awareness, Preference and Distinctiveness Of Islamic Home Financing Type In Indonesia. </span><span class="font6">This study attempts to evaluate public awareness of domestic financing that enhance Islamic Shari'a on it. Islamic banks have grown so rapidly in Indonesia and also offer financing for household finance products. But not all Islamic banks offer financing for households because it requires strong funding for long-term project and a good credit analysis to meet the payback period. Data analysis in this study using factor analysis, Likert scale and preference information, it also conduct an analysis of website information content and can enrich the study respondents. The results of the study is a diversified financial schemes that need to be analyzed further, and significance is an important issue to promote this finance program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstrak: Kesadaran, Preferensi dan Kekhasan Jenis Pembiayaan Berbasis Syariat Islam di Indonesia. </span><span class="font6">Penelitian ini mencoba untuk mengevaluasi kesadaran masyarakat terhadap pembiayaan untuk rumah tangga secara syariat Islam. Bank syariah telah tumbuh begitu cepat di Indonesia dan juga menawarkan produk pembiayaan untuk rumah tangga. Tetapi tidak semua bank syariah dapat menawarkan pembiayaan untuk rumah tangga karena membutuhkan pendanaan yang kuat untuk proyek jangka panjang dan analisis kredit yang baik untuk memenuhi </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">payback</span><span class="font6"> period-nya. Analisis data dalam penelitian ini menggunakan analisis faktor, skala likert dan informasi preferensi, dilakukan juga analisis isi informasi website dan responden untuk dapat memperkaya penelitian.

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Home financing in banks generally can generate income significantly as core products in some banks, especially those which have experiences and capability in this facility. As not all banks actually have capability and strengths in this area, some banks diversify their loans to other products and services. Similar phenomenon also occurs in Islamic bank system which is actually relatively small in funding and less experiences in this area. An Islamic bank may have a specified strength to boost home financing due to inherent characteristics for example</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bank Bukopin Syariah which focused on strategic internal growth and alliance program (Ishak, 2006).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first Islamic bank, Bank Muamalat, does not emphasize home financing as its core banking. The next Islamic banks such as Bank Syariah Mandiri and Bank Syariah Mega might experience similar cases. However, conventional banks like Bank Tabungan Negara that has focused in home financing, when they have Islamic unit, only focused in this area. Moreover, existing customers which have strong</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Islamic belief prefer their home financing in Islamic way to interest based loans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For home financing in conventional loans, banks can determine their interest rate based on their need. Banks can set lower interest rate to attract customers to take their loans in conventional banks. Then, if the rate starts to increase, they increase the rate and sometimes above the average rate. On the other hand, it was hard to decrease even the central bank has decreased the rate first or in decreasing trend. Unlike Islamic bank, they have to set margin in the beginning of contract. Thus, this cannot be changed even the interest rate increased or changed along the period if they take </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">murabahah</span><span class="font6"> (sale) scheme. Thus, Islamic banks usually set the margin above the average interest rate as to mitigate the risk. So, it would be seen that the margin rate set by Islamic banks is more expensive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To avoid that occurrence, Islamic banks proposed other schemes which may adjust or change the determined margin. Usually they are set based on leasing and gradual ownership, they were </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">musharakah mutanaqisah</span><span class="font6"> (investment) and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ijarah muntahiya bit tamlik</span><span class="font6"> (financing lease). This scheme (leasing) was not very common even in the conventional scheme, it is usually applied in vehicle ownership. In addition, some schemes are affected by specified formula that may suit only in certain circumstances (Siswantoro &amp;&nbsp;Qoyyimah, 2005).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This paper tries to analyze the awareness of Islamic home financing in Indonesia through internet respondents. Using online questionnaires we can see the awareness level of Islamic home financing from respondents. This includes other variety of Islamic financing scheme such as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">musharakah mutanaqisah </span><span class="font6">(investment) and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ijarah muntahiya bit tamlik</span><span class="font6"> (financing lease). Further content analysis in related Islamic banks website will enrich the availability of Islamic bank information. There may be a relationship between the awareness of Islamic home</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">financing with specified Islamic bank in these products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 2000s, the data of Islamic home financing is not recorded in detail in Indonesia. This may be caused by Islamic banks still focus in corporate sector. Based on data from Bank Indonesia, even for the construction sector, it is only 8.3% from total financing of Islamic banks in Indonesia (September 2009), while in 2005 it reached 10.1% (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Islamic Banking Statistics</span><span class="font6">, 2004; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Islamic Banking Statistics</span><span class="font6">, 2009). This may be caused by the longer time period of payment which needs a strong and longer funding from liability side. To overcome this problem, Islamic bank actually can issue </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sukuk</span><span class="font6"> to match the financing figures. In advanced structure, they can securitize the asset or property to get such longer funding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Currently, some Islamic banks have offered Islamic home financing especially when the biggest state owned banks whose specialize in this area opened Islamic bank unit, namely Bank Tabungan Negara (BTN). Their experiences and ability to manage conventional home financing can be transformed to Islamic bank unit. Thus, it eased when Islamic bank unit penetrated this market. They only opened their Islamic bank unit in 2006, but they may be dominant in the market share. Their plan for the portfolio, 66% was from existing conventional loans. This study was conducted by Patria (2005) who examined 321 BTN’s customers in 2005. Actually, 54% customers would like to convert their loans into Islamic bank scheme.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>LITERATURE REVIEW</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Researches in Islamic home financing may not as many as conventional ones. Some analysis may be addressed in Malaysia when they applied </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">bay bithaman bil ajil</span><span class="font6"> (deferred sale) which suffered from negative spread after monetary crisis in 1998 in South East Asia. Thus, this can be a valuable lesson to adopt </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">murabahah </span><span class="font6">scheme whose the margin cannot be</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">changed during contract at the same time volatile rates occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Islamic home financing can be an alternative scheme in America which is dominantly controlled by conventional interest based. This is stipulated by demands from Muslims who need financing that is free </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">riba</span><span class="font6"> (usury) based</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">. </span><span class="font6">It needs a description in detail on how home financing in Islamic way uses </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ijara wa iqtina’</span><span class="font6"> (leasing mechanisms) (Thomas, n.d). Furthermore, Abdul-Rahman &amp;&nbsp;Abdelaaty (n.d) compared three institutions in America that offer Islamic home financing, they are Al-Manzil Islamic Financial Services, a business unit of the United Bank of Kuwait PLC. in New York, American Finance House LARIBA–(AFHL) in Pasadena, California, and MSI Financial Services Corporation (MSI) in Houston, Texas. Both of them used </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ijara wa iqtina </span><span class="font6">(leasing) while MSI adopted sharing investment with lease. In addition, longer period installment caused higher margin, in this case MSI only limited its period to 10 years. Some cases in America are also involved in Islamic home financing are : (a) Islamic term caused resistance (b) lack of subsidy (c) bad Islamic image (d) poor image (e) discrimination (f) lack of competitive products (g) debate of Islamic bank and (h) poor socialization. Compared to Indonesia, some are still relevant in Indonesian context.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Different home Islamic financing can be a problem itself to customers who can assume that lack of authority and transparency from each method (Haris, 2007). Customers would like to be informed in detail for any type of Islamic home financing. Similar phenomenon also occurred in America (Abdul-Rahman &amp;&nbsp;Abdelaaty, n.d).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To measure the awareness of product, actually it refers to brand awareness theory. It can be in a statement asked to some respondents about how well they know the issue in likert scale measurement (Liaogang et al., 2007) and recognize it (Bram, 2005). In addition, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">statement can be in the form of comparison, description and characteristics (Liao et al., n.d) and image (Villarejo-Ramos et al., n.d). Furthermore, Hagijanto </span><span class="font5">(2001) stated that other factors can affect the awareness such as market segment, demography, and segment focus. In the case of Islamic home financing, some characteristics should be identified by respondents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brand awareness is quite important for a customer to decide whether to buy the product. This is because of : (a) think a product, (b) consideration, and (c) association of the image </span><span class="font6">(Keller, 1993). Therefore, the number of respondents who are aware of Islamic home financing can be a significant factor in the development of the product.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In relation to this, some statements are raised to measure the awareness of Islamic home financing, they are :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prioritization of Islamic bank in Islamic home financing</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characteristics of Islamic home financing</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme of diversifying Islamic home financing</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignorance in other Islamic home financing</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">In addition, content analysis that investigated Islamic home financing is conducted in order to see the characteristics (legal, status, plafond, tenure, down payment) of Islamic home financing and adequate information.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>RESULT AND ANALYSIS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This research tries to analyze the awareness of home Islamic financing in Indonesia. It employed respondents based on questionnaires. Sample was taken from online survey through internet by </span><a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com"><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">www.surveygizmo.com</span></a><span class="font6">. In this research, 140 respondents filled questionnaires, 2 incomplete and 169 who are abandoned. The abandoned means that respondents only opened the website but they did not fill it. This can mean that they may not understand the context or reluctant to answer it. From this, actually we can see</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">that the awareness of Indonesian people on Islamic bank especially Islamic home financing is quite low.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The location of respondents is mainly dominated in Java, then east Indonesia. Others are in Malaysia,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Australia, Middle East, United Kingdom and United States (see Figure 1). From outside Indonesia, they may be Indonesian people who stay in the particular country. The sample was taken from 12 to 19 November 2009 (see Figure 2).</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">For content analysis, it investigated website of Islamic home financing taken from related Islamic banks on 12 November 2009. It analyzes related information content which might give adequate comprehension to customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, this may relate in socializing of Islamic home financing of Islamic banks which actually needs hard efforts. In addition, this can correlate to respondents’ preferences.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Total respondents are 311, but only 140 respondents filled the questionnaire. This shows that not many people are aware of this issue. The survey online system only permitted one respondent to fill once. It can detect the IP address and location of the respondents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Table 1 shows that most respondents are in productive age (between 23 to 40). The number of respondent who has Islamic bank account is bigger than those who do not have (80 compared to 60, or 57.1%). Further research is explore and discuss on the categorization of Islamic bank account customers and otherwise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Some conclusions regarding this issue are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(a) Not many people are aware of Islamic home financing; this is shown by the number of abandoned respondents who is bigger than respondents who filled the questionnaire, (b) Islamic bank customers who filled the questionnaire do not believe that Islamic home financing is better, cheaper and easier in the application. This may be caused by risks to be borne along installment period. So, Islamic home financing looked quite expensive even compared to conventional loans, (c) the highest comprehension in Islamic home financing type is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">murabahah</span><span class="font6"> followed by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">musharakah mutanaqisah</span><span class="font6"> then </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ijarah muntahiya bit tamlik.</span><span class="font6"> This may caused by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">murabahah</span><span class="font6"> is already known at the first time in Islamic home financing. Others are still needed to be marketed intensively, and last but not least (d) most people are aware of which scheme that they would like to apply even though others have additional benefits.</span></p>
