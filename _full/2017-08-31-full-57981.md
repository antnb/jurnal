<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting Setting</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In planning space in lighting is one of the most important factors. Lighting is not only functional but also</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">has aesthetic value. There are two types of lighting, namely general lightning which is lighting that must be evenly distributed in the room, serves to support activities, and decorative lightning which is lighting that plays a role for the beauty of space. In the nautical concept lighting arrangement is identical to the feel of the sea. The use of white and yellow light dominates in space.</span></p>

There are several types of lighting that are used, to create the impression of a coastal lamp shade used with a model of lighting on the ship as its characteristics.

<p><span class="font3">In space planning the artwork has many functions. A room cannot be separated from the existence of artwork as an aesthetic enhancer. Besides the main function to beautify the room, artwork can provoke creativity and imagination and create a different atmosphere in the room. To reinforce the nautical concept that is applied to space, several artworks are used that characterize the coast. The artwork used is dominated by blue and white designs, inspiring sea, beach and sailing ships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Figure 6 is the artwork used in the design. Pan-tai as the main inspiration for the arrangement of artwork. Beach painting with white frames on the main wall. DIY wall decoration is placed in small corners of space. Cushions on the sofa with a coastal design, a display rack with various bottle displays and shells. Ship steering wheel decoration on the wall gives the atmosphere of the sea. Wooden wall clock in pale blue gives a natural impression. With finishing the room artwork becomes increasingly impressed with life and the impression of the coast that you want to display can be clearly felt.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark7"></a>III. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Villa as a temporary residence, generally used for a place to stay when on vacation is required to be able to provide a calm atmosphere to the civitas in it. To create an atmosphere of calm and harmony with the surrounding environment, the design of a deep space can be a solution. The nau-tical concept in the interior is the most appropriate arrangement to create a beach atmosphere in a villa located around a coastal area. With the application of the nautical concept to the interior space, it can create the impression of calm, relax, and clean which is characteristic of the beach, thus the design of the space in the villa can be harmonious with the atmosphere of the surrounding environment. In structuring the nautical concept of deep space, there are several things that must be considered, namely the arrangement of furniture with natural materials with shades of the beach; finishing material with a white base color combined with blue and brown; lighting that is identical to the atmosphere of the sea; and artwork inspired by the state of the sea.</span></p>
