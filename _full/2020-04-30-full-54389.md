<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Drought is a natural disaster whose frequency is quite high and occurs almost every year. According to the radarbali.jawapos.com page on June 15, 2019, rice fields in Karangasem are threatened by drought. 2000 hectares of agricultural land threatened with drought or did not get irrigation supply because during the dry season the water source used to irrigate the land was drastically reduced and even partly dried up. From the observations of the UPTD of the Horticultural Agricultural Plant Protection Agency (BPTPH) of the Bali Provincial Agriculture Office, until June 2019 there was damage to rice fields due to drought where observations were made since the start of the planting season in May. Drought area information is used to map and calculate the area of drought areas, so that areas with drought potential can be identified. One way to get drought area data is by remote sensing technology. Identification of potential drought areas is the basic idea for the formation of drought identification applications in East Bali. The remote sensing application uses the NDDI (Normalized Difference Drought Index) method. NDDI is the result of calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is an index of vegetation parameters and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) which is the value of wetness of vegetation. The images used in this study are Landsat 8 imagery with OLI (Onboard Operational Land Imager) sensor and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) sensor. The result of the application of drought area identification is the visualization of drought area and the extent of drought area based on the category of very dry, dry, mild dry, normal and non-classification using hectare units.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Natural disasters are phenomena that can threaten the survival of life. The negative effects of natural disasters can directly affect the activities of living things. Drought is a natural disaster whose frequency is quite high and occurs almost every year [1]. Most natural disasters that occur in Indonesia are disasters related to climate change such as floods, droughts and forest fires. Data that contains information on potential areas of drought which slightly plays a role as one of the factors that hamper in solving drought problems, so drought area data is needed considering drought is a problem that has a serious impact on all sectors of life [2].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Remote sensing technology is developing rapidly along with the changing times. Remote sensing technology produces a variety of data both aerial photographs and satellite imagery that can describe the surface of the earth. Satellite technology plays an important role in remote sensing because it is able to analyze the state of the Earth's vegetation without direct contact with the object of research. One of the Remote sensing research in the field of environment and disaster mitigation is about drought that is discussed in this research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Previous research as a reference for this paper was conducted by Fadli Rahman with an analysis of agricultural land drought in Kendal Regency in 2015 with the Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI) algorithm [3] and using the Head of National Disaster Management Agency (Perka BNPB) No. 2 of 2012 about general guidelines for assessing disaster risk. Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI) is a new method for drought delineation using MODIS surface reflectance data which was first presented in a paper by Yingxin Gu in 2007 [4]. The experimental results of both methods, obtained an NDDI method accuracy of 82% and BNPB Perka of 70%. The NDDI method can be concluded more accurately than Perka BNPB in identifying the drought of agricultural land in Kendal Regency in 2015.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Drought identification research utilizes Landsat 8 imagery as research data and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) algorithm, NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index), and then combined in NDDI (Normalized Difference Drought Index) method. Research into the drought identification of the East Bali region developed software. In contrast to previous studies using existing software, this study developed applications using Landsat 8 OLI / TIRS imagery, with test data on old data on March 27, 2014 and new data on March 16, 2016 with methods similar to previous research. The developed application can identify areas of drought and analyze the extent of drought areas based on the categories of very dry, dry, mild dry, normal and non-classification using units of hectares.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The research methodology is a description of the entire process carried out on the system and modules that will later be applied into the application. General description of application Identification of drought areas in East Bali is explained in Figure 1.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/54389-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:426pt;height:298pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1. General Description of the System</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The drought identification phase begins by loading the two images required with the red, green and blue bands in each image and loading the metadata in the image. The second stage is image cutting to get the area that you want to study. The third stage is the composite RGB and False Color which is used to distinguish objects in the image. The fourth stage is the NDVI process to determine the vegetation index contained in the image. The vegetation object is an object</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">with a high water absorption capacity, vice versa objects other than vegetation are waterproof objects. The high NDVI value indicates the areawith high vegetation density, ability high water absorption. Instead the NDVI value is Low indicates the area with density low vegetation, water absorption ability low identified drought. The fifth stage is the NDWI process which is used to determine the index of water content in vegetation. The assumption used is increasingly low transformation spectral value the wetness index of an object then the object is drier, conversely the higher the grade level spectral transformation of the index the wetness of an object, then the object getting wetter. The sixth stage is the NDDI process to display potentially drought areas. The seventh stage is the classification of the NDDI process. NDDI process that will produce</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">output in the form of images that contain areas that are having drought. Drought is categorized into five categories, there are is very dry, dry, mild dry, normal and non-classification categories.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Literature study is a set of basic theories that are used in developing applications of identification of drought areas in East Bali based on remote sensing. Literature review is obtained from journals or books or the internet that supports making applications.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remote Sensing</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Since 1972, Landsat satellites have been continuously receiving surface images of the Earth's land surface, shallow beaches and space-based coral reefs. The Landsat Program is the result of collaboration from the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which was established to collect soil images from space regularly. NASA developed remote sensing instruments and spacecraft, which then launched and validated the performance of instruments and satellites. The USGS then assumes satellite ownership and operation, while also managing all land image reception, data archiving, product generation, and distribution. The outcome of this program is a long-term record of changes caused by nature and humans globally [7].</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Remote sensing imagery is obtained from a satellite, aircraft or other device. Remote sensing images come from sensor recordings that have different characteristics at each height level which ultimately determine the difference from the remote sensing data generated. The Landsat satellite is one of the remote sensing satellites that was first launched in 1972 [8]. The use of Landsat imagery for land use mapping is especially popular in developing countries to speed up the acquisition of the data needed or to update old data.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landsat 8 Satellite</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Landsat 8 satellites have sensors with different ranges, each of which has characteristics that are determined by the frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each range in Landsat 8 imagery is known as a band. In total Landsat 8 has 11 bands [8]. Pixel values in commercial satellite imagery indicate exposure from the earth's surface in the form of Digital Numbers (DN) calibrated to a range of values. Conversion of DN into real exposure needs to be done for comparative analysis of several images taken by different sensors. Landsat 8 image needed to conduct oil spill detection research. There are three bands namely Band 4- Visible Red Band which is useful for discriminating vegetation slopes, Band 3- Visible Green Band which is useful for emphasizing peak vegetation which is useful for assessing plant strength and Band 3- Visible Blue is a useful band for mapping bathymetry and distinguishing land, Band 5- Visible NIR is a useful band to emphasize biomass and coastline content. Utilization of Landsat imagery has been numerous used for several survey activities as well as research, including geology, mining, geomorphology, hydrology and forestry. Monitoring the drought based remote sensing information becomes popular and widely used because of cost the cheaper, data availability continuous and data reliability which high.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">NDVI is a method that is often used to utilize the Spectral Vegetation Index (SVI) spectral data from remote sensing. Spectral vegetation index from remote sensing data is formed due to differences in reflection of waves from the leaves of living plants with other objects on the surface of the earth at green wavelengths (visible) and near infrared (invisible) [4]. NDVI equation is the result of reducing the pixel value of the near infrared band to the visible red band. The input band used must be radiometrically corrected first [5]. The NDVI equation is mathematically described in equation (1).</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">NDWI is a remote sensing based indicator that is sensitive to changes in leaf moisture content. One of them is used to monitor changes in leaf water content, using near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) wavelengths. The NDWI equation is mathematically described in equation (2).</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The results of the NDWI which is an index, has a range of values of -1 for non-bodies of water and 1 for appearance of bodies of water, so a treshold is needed to separate the bodies of water and non-bodies of water. Other uses are to monitor changes related to water content in water bodies such as rivers, lakes, swamps, oceans and oceans using green wavelengths (band green) and NIR (near-infrared band) described in equation 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The NDWI algorithm is used to monitor vegetation in areas affected by drought, it is recommended to use NIR and SWIR. SWIR reflections reflect changes in the moisture content of vegetation and mesophyll structures such as flowers in the vegetation canopy. NIR reflection is influenced by the internal structure of the leaf and the leaf dry matter content, but not by the moisture content. The combination of NIR and SWIR eliminates variations caused by the leaf's internal structure and leaf dry matter content, increasing accuracy in taking vegetation water content. Spectral green and NIR bands are recommended if looking for water levels or changes in water levels, such as floods.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Application of Drought Area Identification in East Bali Based on Remote Sensing using the NDDI (Normalized Difference Drought Index) method is able to identify drought areas. The process of calculating drought area identification applications in East Bali based on remote sensing is carried out with several stages, namely loading test images, composite image processes, NDVI and NDWI calculation processes, NDDI calculation processes, and analysis of drought area areas. The first stage required in the application is the process of cropping carried out on the loaded image to determine the area under study. Image composite process to obtain true color and false color. The NDVI calculation process is carried out to get the value of vegetation density, and the NDWI calculation process to get the value of vegetation wetness. The next process carried out the NDDI process to identify drought areas in East Bali. The cropping process gained a total area of 213,838.64 hectares in each of the old images and new images. The results of calculations on the old image drought data contained 9,919.17 hectares of Very Dry, 4,725.45 hectares of Dry, 12,619.98 hectares of Light Dry, 81,381.78 hectares of Normal, and 106,192.26 hectares of non-classification. The new image drought data shows there are 6,315.39 hectares of Very Dry, 23,348.52 hectares of Dry, 28,480.5 hectares of Light Dry, 50,325.48 hectares of Normal, and 106,368.75 hectares of Non-Classification. Changes in data that occur from the old image with the new image are -3,603.78 hectares Very Dry 18,623.07 hectares Dry, 15,860.52 hectares Lightly Dry, -31,056.3 hectares Normal, and 176.49 hectares for non-classification.</span></p>
