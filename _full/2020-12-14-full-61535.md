CVRP is a variant of VRP that can be used to find the minimum distance and number of vehicles In this paper three algorithm for initial solutions are compared to find the minimum distance for shipping goods from distribution center to all outlets routinely in West Jakarta  Improved Clarke and Wright ICW algorithm Karagul Tokat Aydemir KTA algorithm  and Sweeping  Cluster First Route Second algorithm The results show that Sweeping algorithm is the shortes
