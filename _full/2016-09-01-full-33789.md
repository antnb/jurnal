<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tujuan Penelitian ini adalah untuk mengidentifikasi jenis-jenis tindak ilokusi dan untuk menganalisis fungsi dari jenisnya tersebut di dalam film berjudul &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. Teori untuk mengidentifikasi jenis-jenis tindakan ilokusi berasal dari Searle (1976) yang didukung oleh Yule (1996) sedangkan untuk menentukan fungsi dari setiap jenis menggunakan teori oleh Hymes (1974). Metode deskritif kualitatif digunakan untuk menganalisa data. Hasil penelitian ini adalah lima jenis tindak ilokusi ditemukan dalam film ini dan ada beberapa fungsi dari setiap jenis.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Every person believes that communication makes our life exist. Communication becomes a main part in life. Communication cannot be separated with language that we used; human uses language as the way to communicate. Language is used to make people enable to have more interaction with others to convey their ideas, feelings, or thoughts clearly. Communicating with someone defined as the delivery of messages. Therefore, the message must accepted by saying appropriately</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Austin states that there are three basic types of speech act, namely locutionary act, illocutionary act and perlocutionary act. From those three types of speech act, illocutionary act is considered quite complex. Illocutionary act defined that the making of statement, offer, promise, etc, in uttering a sentence (Levinson, 1983:236). Searle (1976) classifies the types of illocutionary acts, they are representatives, directives, commissives, expressive, and declaratives.In uttering something, the real meaning of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">utterance is often confusing for the hearer to understand the meaning of the speaker. Therefore, this study was conducted to find out the problem from that phenomena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This study was focused on analyzing the types of illocutionary act and the functions of those illocutionary act in a movie entitled “Die Another Day”. . This movie tells about the mission to</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea"><span class="font2"> North Korea </span></a><span class="font2">that done by Bond (actor) as he leads, during which he is betrayed and, after seemingly killing a rogue North Korean</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangjwa"><span class="font2"> colonel,</span></a><span class="font2"> is captured and imprisoned.</span></p>

Wilson </span></a><span class="font2">and</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Broccoli"><span class="font2"> Barbara Broccoli,</span></a><span class="font2"> and directed by</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Tamahori"><span class="font2"> Lee Tamahori </span></a><span class="font2">in 2002. It is a famous action/adventure movie in that year This movie tells about the mission to</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea"><span class="font2"> North Korea </span></a><span class="font2">that done by Bond (actor), he is sent to investigate the connection</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">between a North Korean terrorist and a diamond mogul who is funding the development of an international space weapon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This movie is very interesting, because it tells about the mission. It means many utterances that were founded and the dialogues contain the illocutionary acts. Because of that, it is very worth in order to be analyzed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The data was analyzed by applying descriptive qualitative method. The first step of analyzing data was classifying the data into each type of illocutionary act using theory proposed by Searle (1976) and supported by Yule (1996). Afterwards, the analysis of the context of situation involved in the movie to determine the function of those illocutionary acts using the theory of ethnography of S-P-E-A-K-I-N-G Dell Hymes (1974). The analysis was presented by firstly showing the data in the form of conversation. The utterances later on that were analysed are in bold and italic types; therefore the readers can understand the illocutionary acts.</span></p>
