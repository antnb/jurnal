Currently most of basic control engineering lectures teach both mathematic model and control of an inverted pendulum to explain stability problems in dynamic systems The inverted pendulum system is a pendulum controlled with a certain force in order to stand in balance around vertical equilibrium line Hence this system is a highly unstable system and needs stabilization methods using a kind of controller This paper describes how to design a Proportional Derivat
