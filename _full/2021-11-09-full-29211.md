<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of the Study</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Literature is a piece of history in the form of art which rises enchantment using language. It can be analyzed in its intrinsic and extrinsic elements. The prior elements cover the inside parts of the literay work such as themes, character, plot, setting, point of view etc. The latter deal with the outside parts of literay work, i.e., social, psychological, historical and philosophical factors related to literary work (Wellek and Warren, 1948:73).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This study is intended to analyze the intrinsic elements of a Japanese comic or known as manga. The manga which is used as the object in this study has been adapted</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">to three anime series, three stage plays, one anime-movies and a live action film entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kuroshitsuji</span><span class="font3"> (2006) by Yana Toboso. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kuroshitsuji</span><span class="font3"> or in English –Black Butler tells story about a twelve years old –then thirteen, nobble-boy who made contract with a demon in order to get revenge of the death of his parents.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Findings and Discussions</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Analysis of Setting in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kuroshitsuji</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The events of the story in Noah Ark Circus arc in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kuroshitsuji</span><span class="font3"> happened in 9 places. The first setting was in the Scotland Yard’s File Room, the second was in Undertaker’s shop, the third happened in the show of Noah Ark Circus, the fourth was in the Town House, the fifth happened in the Circus’s backstage area, the sixth was in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Baron Kelvin’s mansion, the seventh happened in the Train station, the eighth was in the Workhouse, and the last one happened in the Phantomhive mansion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The File Room</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Ciel Phantomhive and his butler Sebastian Michaelis broke through the file room</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and collected files of the lost children without permission. The page showing the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">event of the story occurring in a file room can be seen on page 1 chapter 24.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/29211-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:141pt;height:217pt;">
<p><span class="font3">The file room is located in the third floor of Scotland Yard’s office. In front of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">door of the file room, there is a ‘File Room’ sign and next to the door there is another sign written as ‘No Entry, Permission’. There are a lot of books in the file room. Two boxes can also be seen piled-upnear the book shelf where Ciel is standing next to Aberline. The file room in Noah Ark Circus Ark is considered the Neutral Setting. According to Kenney the Neutral setting is little more than reflection of the truth that things have to be happening somewhere. It is a setting in which the environment of the story tells about a certain place, which in this case is the file room.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undertaker’s Shop</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The page that shows that Ciel is visiting Undertaker is page 7 from chapter 24. It is shown that Ciel’s horse carrige arrived in front of Undertaker’s shop. In front of his shop, there is a sign written as ‘Undertaker’ under a skull looking down to it.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/29211-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:188pt;height:116pt;">
<p><span class="font3">There is only one front door in his shop, and on the left and right sides of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">front door, there are grave-yard stuffs such as woods, coffins dan tombstone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Undertaker is famous for his custom-made coffin, so inside of his shop there are some multi-function coffins. According to the type of settings by Kenney, Undertaker’s shop is considered the Neutral setting, because the story happened in a certain place which is the shop.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Show of Noah Ark Circus</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The third place that Ciel and Sebastian visited in the Noah Ark Circus arc was the Circus. Their arrival in the Circus can be seen from page 16 chapter 24, where Ciel and his butler were standing below the welcome sign of Noah’s Ark Circus.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/29211-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:186pt;height:117pt;">
<p><span class="font3">The inside part of the Circus tent was shown very glamour with three hanging lamps in the ceiling. The seating position of the audiences leads directly to the stage. When every stage of performers from the circus member is speaking, there will be a stage lighting so the audience will focused on the speaking person. The show of Noah Ark Circus is considered the Neutral setting, because the story is happening in a certain place and time which is the Noah Ark Circus’ show itself.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town House</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Page 27 chapters 25 is showing the situation in Ciel’s bedroom. In his bedroom there is a large bed with curtains. Some pictures are hanging on the wall and one big mirror is placed on the wall near the table. According to Kenney’s theory, the town house setting in this arc is considered a Neutral setting type, because the story is happening in a certain place and time.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/29211-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:143pt;height:104pt;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Backstage Area of the Circus</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This time Ciel and Sebastian are trying to be circus members, but there is an audition for Ciel if he wants to be a circus member. In page 33 chapter 25, Ciel is drawn standing on a small podium preparing for his tight rope. The tight rope walking takes place inside the tent where the circus member used to do their shows.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/29211-5.jpg" alt="" style="width:124pt;height:125pt;">
<p><span class="font3">In the back stage area, the tent of new comers and the tent of main cast members were different. Beside the tent for sleeping and mass hall tent, there is also a practice. The backstage area of the circus in this arc is considered a Neutral type of setting, because the story is happening in a certain place and time which is the backstage area of the circus.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron Kelvin’s Mansion</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Sebastian and Ciel moved to meet Baron Kelvin by visiting his mansion. Inside Baron Kelvin’s mansion, the first room that Ciel and Sebastian saw is a room filled with string puppets. It can be seen in chapter 31 page 2 where Ciel and Sebastian are quite shocked seeing all the sting puppets. Some of the sting puppets are not complete and some of them are also placed in a cage. On the wall, there are three frames which frame the sting puppets. One of the puppets in the frame is having the shape of a horse. A string puppet even hanging around the ceiling attached to the lamp. In this part of the story, the setting is considered the Neutral setting type because the story is happening in a certain place and time.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/29211-6.jpg" alt="" style="width:132pt;height:190pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Train Station</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The train station is drawn in page 6 chapter 36. In the train station there are some people dressed as noble including Ciel. The train is drawn only the side part of it. Ciel as a noble man is taking the first class seat so he entered the train using the door with ‘first class’ sign. The Train Station is considered a Neutral setting type because it is a certain place where the story is happening.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/29211-7.jpg" alt="" style="width:139pt;height:204pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workhouse</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The workhouse which Ciel wants to pay a visit is located up a small hill at a small village. Yet the workhouse which they saw is nothing as what Ciel has in mind. There is only the ruins of an old building</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font3">The sign of the workhouse is even unreadable. It is drawn in page 16 chapter 36. Ciel is going to the workhouse to introduce himself as a new donatur after killing the former donatur for the Workhouse, Baron Kelvin. The Workhouse is considered a Neutral setting based on Kenney’s theory because the event of the story is happening in a certain place and time.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/29211-8.jpg" alt="" style="width:142pt;height:199pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phantomhive Mansion</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Ciel went back to the Phantomhive Mansion after all his works was done. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Phantomhive Mansion is a quite big mansion with fancy architecture from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Vistorian era, as can be seen in page 29 chapter 37. The Phantomhive Mansion is a Neutral setting type basen on Kenney’s theory, because the event in the story is happening in a certain place, which is the Phantomhive Mansion itself.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/29211-9.jpg" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:134pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The result showed that sequence of setting in Noah Ark Circus arc of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kuroshitsuji </span><span class="font3">happened in 9 places.
