<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Abstract</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Organizational culture refers to the underlying beliefs, assumptions, values, and interaction styles contributing to the distinctive social and psychological environment. The study was measured statistically with approximately 200 participants in Indonesia. The service-oriented strategy had a significant good and direct influence on business services, while the greater service-oriented strategy had an extra influence on the respondents' organizational readiness and knowledge exchange. Through their business services, service-oriented firms seek to delight customers, produce and deliver customer value in the marketplace, and enhance their company's performance and profitability. In order to meet the everincreasing demands of investors, employees, and consumers, business organizations are continuously under pressure to assess and enhance their performance in competitive markets. As a result, businesses partition their organization and related business services into smaller, self-sufficient company components that can interact to optimize efficiency. In order to be capable of providing excellent services, business services must clearly adhere to business-oriented strategies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Keywords: </span><span class="font5">business strategy, business process, governance, business information system</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In intense competition, business organizations are under constant pressure to examine and improve their performance to meet the rising expectations of investors, employees, and consumers </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Asry et al., 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. Moreover, investors, employees, and customers desire advances in this field of company services during the pandemic recovery period. During the COVID-19 epidemic, we discovered that many customers utilized services such as food and product delivery </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Saputra, 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">. Therefore, businesses should reinforce their corporate culture and services-focused strategy. In this study, however, the individual understanding of corporate culture in service-oriented business service strategies is called into doubt </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Abdullah et al., 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. This study was carried out to see whether each participant who is also a purchaser is aware of the strategy employed by business services firms in terms of business processes, governance, process-aware information systems, the nature of business services, organizational readiness, and knowledge sharing </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Laeheem, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">problem with this study is that not all persons are aware of the organizational culture and service-oriented strategy utilized by business services businesses. Furthermore, some individuals merely criticize and wish for service enhancements. These individuals need to attempt to comprehend the hurdles or strategic planning involved in providing the finest service for them </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(dos Santos et al., 2017)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The individual needs to be made aware of the organizational culture that is essential for business services organizations to boost staff morale and brand recognition and to give the best and most distinguished service to their consumers </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Giampietri et al.,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. Organizational culture has been highlighted as both a valuable intangible asset and a barrier to imitation with substantial performance implications.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Hendri et al. (2020)</span></a><span class="font5"> claimed that organizational culture serves two purposes: it enables internal integration and adjusts to changes in the external environment. According to</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Saputra et al. (2021),</span></a><span class="font5"> examining organizational culture could aid in comprehending performance as companies respond to changing conditions based on their existing culture. This study aimed to assess individuals' comprehension of organizational culture and service-oriented strategies that support business services businesses' internal business operations. In addition, this study aims to increase awareness of this topic and stimulate curiosity by determining how many individuals or respondents are familiar with the organizational culture and service-oriented approach of business services businesses </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Sá et al., 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The researcher determined that the theory of business by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Drucker (1994) </span></a><span class="font5">is appropriate for this study. This theory addresses the assumptions used to construct the behaviour or culture of an organization. According to</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Miemczyk et al. (2016),</span></a><span class="font5"> the Business theory is tied to our three-part research framework, which consists of the environment, mission, and core competencies. First are the assumptions about the business or organization's environment linked to Independent Variables, such as business processes, governance, and process-aware information systems. These assumptions about the corporate environment define the character of business, its purpose, and the culture and ethics of business. The unique goal of the firm or organization is assumed to be linked between the mediating variable, business services, and the dependent variable, a service-oriented strategy </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Asher et al., 2015)</span></a><span class="font5">. These assumptions on the business mission establish what the business objective considers to be substantial results in enhancing the economy and society/lifestyle at large. The third factor in analyzing is the assumptions regarding the essential competencies required to achieve the organization's mission </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Muisyo et al., 2022)</span></a><span class="font5">. This theory relates to service-oriented strategy because we discovered a supporting statement stating that &quot;the second perspective on service orientation, such as an organizational view, is required to study a company's service-oriented strategy because business services are enabled within an organization.&quot; A service-oriented strategy emphasizes how an organization is internally connected with its environment, mission, and core competencies to retain its leadership and commercial objectives </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Lu et al., 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The service-oriented approach most closely relates to business services. Through the business services they provide, service-oriented firms will seek to please customers, generate and deliver customer value (e.g., service quality and service value), and improve company performance and profitability </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Sá et al., 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. Evidence from anecdotal stories, in-depth case studies and conceptual frameworks in service operations management has consistently indicated that examples of business service delivery require a comprehensive approach. These utilize &quot;bundles of best practices&quot; as the foundation for their operational skills to constantly deliver exceptional services and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">achieve outstanding business outcomes </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Aharoni, 2018; Chandra, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5">. According to the previous study, the availability and demand for a company's business services impact its service-oriented strategy </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Buxel et al., 2015; Sara &amp;&nbsp;Saputra, 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">. According to</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Sorin &amp;&nbsp;Carmen (2012),</span></a><span class="font5"> business services encompass a vast array of services (such as legal, accounting, product and end-user service design, research and development, and (information) technology support). Organizations divide their enterprise and associated business services into smaller, independent business components that may interact to increase efficiency. Therefore, commercial services must adopt business-oriented tactics if they are to provide superior services. The association between attitude loyalty to favoured brands and behavioural brand loyalty to corporate services is good </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Lee et al.,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2016)</span></a><span class="font5">. The relationship between satisfaction with priority brands and loyalty to the attitude of business services towards priority brands is good. Participation in the product category positively correlates with brand loyalty for the top business services brands. Participation in the product category correlates favourably with satisfaction with the top business services brands </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Al &amp;&nbsp;Anıl, 2016)</span></a><span class="font5">. For all of those reasons, there is a hypothesis. H</span><span class="font2">1</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">: </span><span class="font5">Business services are positively influenced by a service-oriented strategy to create attitude loyalty to preferred companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the organizational level, two essential dimensions of readiness are proposed: commitment, which is defined as the extent to which employees value and share a commitment to make a change, and efficacy, which is defined as employees' belief in their own and their organization's ability to implement the necessary changes </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Sisaye &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Birnberg, 2010)</span></a><span class="font5">. The capability to address the readiness requirements of different groups provides a practical technique for addressing readiness gaps within the organization </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(D’Agostino, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5">. Prior to implementation, viewing preparedness development as a stage-based process provides sufficient time and space for successful cross-organizational engagement </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Warrick, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5">. Considered a prerequisite for successful organizational transformation, readiness is typically incorporated into a larger project planning and implementation framework </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Cadez &amp;&nbsp;Guilding, 2012)</span></a><span class="font5">. However, organizational readiness could provide the corporation with competitive benefits as it prepares to develop robust strategies or plans in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">H</span><span class="font2">2</span><span class="font5">: A service-oriented strategy is effectively influenced by organizational readiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Knowledge sharing approaches do not immediately increase service firms' effectiveness. On the other hand, information exchange techniques might result in intermediate outcomes that improve organizational performance </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Demartini &amp;&nbsp;Paoloni,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2013)</span></a><span class="font5">. These basic differences also impact the incorporation and management of knowledge in business processes. Knowledge exchange may be unidirectional, characterized by one-way traffic </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Iqbal &amp;&nbsp;Sholihin, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. In an outsourcing agreement, for instance, clients and their suppliers share expertise regarding the delivery of products or services </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Zameer et al., 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. However, this does not imply that providers will inevitably share their expertise with clients. Typically, companies whose business is sales knowledge and expertise, like market researchers or news organizations, engage in unilateral knowledge sharing. In other instances, the logic of cooperation implies bilateral or mutually advantageous knowledge sharing </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Muwardi et al., 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. Numerous scholars have claimed that service-oriented businesses are more dependent on knowledge work and, thus, place a greater emphasis on knowledge resources </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Iqbal &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Sidhu, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. Especially in newly distributed businesses, the effectiveness of knowledge sharing between individuals, teams, and units is crucial to their success. Knowledge sharing could provide the corporation with the necessary resources to create effective</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">business-oriented strategies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">H</span><span class="font2">3</span><span class="font5">: Knowledge sharing positively influences a service-oriented strategy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Business process management is a management method that optimizes the execution of business processes inside a company. According to</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Ojo et al. (2015),</span></a><span class="font5"> business procedures should be centred on how a corporation that must generate revenue manages its commercial activities. According to</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Muisyo et al. (2022),</span></a><span class="font5"> a (business) process is a methodical, measurable sequence of operations designed to generate a specified result for a certain customer or market. It suggests a high emphasis on how work is performed inside an organization, as opposed to what is performed, as in product focus. Thus, a process is an organized ordering of labour activities through time and space, with a beginning and an end, as well as clearly defined inputs and outputs </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Zvezdov, 2012)</span></a><span class="font5">. Adopting a process-oriented perspective necessitates embracing the customer's viewpoint. The framework by which a firm achieves its objectives and provides value to its customers is its processes. A business process is a thorough, dynamically coordinated series of activities or logically related tasks that must be completed to deliver value to customers or achieve other strategic goals </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Mishra &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Yadav, 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">. The business process is essential for delivering customer services because it aligns with business objectives. People have known for decades that businesses must regularly revamp their business processes to keep their operational methods in line with their evolving business requirements </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Hellmeister &amp;&nbsp;Richins, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. Changes to business processes must be carefully comprehended and articulated, and their impact must be precisely stated. To obtain this insight, it is necessary to develop business process models </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Wagner, 2009)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">H</span><span class="font2">4a</span><span class="font5">: The relationship between business processes alignment for strategy implementation was integrated with business services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The governance or management processes required by the service component for autonomous operations, including metrics and procedures for motivation, performance, and accountability for organizational and business success, are described by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Baumgartner &amp;&nbsp;Rauter (2017);</span></a><span class="font5"> governance is essential to the creation of a business service-oriented strategy in order to improve the performance of business services. Examining the relationship between corporate governance and corporate performance is conducted by returning the corporate governance mechanism's variables and the profitability control variables </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Almaqtari et al., 2022)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Process-Aware Information System (PAIS) is a software system that organizes and executes operational processes involving people, applications, and data sources based on process models capable of delivering effectiveness in service-oriented contexts </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Ernawati, 2005)</span></a><span class="font5">. PAIS facilitates the automation of corporate processes and service delivery </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Amanda &amp;&nbsp;Restuti, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. Based on a process model, a software system controls and executes operational processes involving personnel, applications, and/or information sources </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Anthony, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. Process-Aware Information System (PAIS) is one of the independent factors that could drive the services-oriented approach, given that all business services must use technology to deliver their services to the client in this era of digitalization. Today, organizations are investing in technologically enabled business</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">environments, and as a result, opportunities to build business value through service partnerships have emerged </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Chandra, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5">. Consequently, a new service-oriented way of thinking is emerging, utilizing technology to adapt to altering circumstances </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Cruz et</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">al., 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">.

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Research Method</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This study includes seven constructs. Each construct was measured with multiple items, all of which had been adopted or adapted from previous studies. To measure the determinants of the business processes (BUP), governance (GVN), process-aware information systems (PAIS), business services (BUS), organizational readiness (ORG) and knowledge sharing (KSH), and service-oriented strategy (SOS) were constructed. The research uses a quantitative approach. Data collection was done by distributing online questionnaires to the respondents. The questionnaires were distributed using social media designed in google forms to help gather respondents. In this questionnaire, there are 5 Likert Scales used such as: (1) strongly disagree; (2) disagree; (3) neutral; (4) agree, and (5) strongly agree. The questionnaire managed to attract 200 respondents.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">PAIS, organizational readiness, knowledge exchange, and business services have direct effects on service-oriented strategy. However, the business services area has also mediated business processes, governance, and PAIS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This study assessed an individual's comprehension of organizational culture and service-oriented strategy as they pertain to a business services corporation. The researcher utilizes Google forms for decision-making, sampling, and obtaining samples from respondents to the conducted study. The researcher collected responses from all respondents, whether they worked in the government sector or the private sector, were self-employed, jobless, in retirement, or were students. The researcher invited each respondent to complete the questionnaire since they are consumers who utilize various business services organizations' services to conduct their daily operations. The researcher included respondents' demographic information on the online questionnaire's first page. In the second section of this questionnaire, the researcher lists seven variables, each with several items. A statement regarding business processes, governance, process-aware information systems, business services, organizational readiness and knowledge exchange, and service-oriented strategy are included in this part. At the conclusion of this questionnaire, respondents were asked some open-ended questions. The responses to this questionnaire are useful for performing this investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This research processed demographic data using SPSS while using a framework and hypothesis test using SmartPLS. In the social sciences, PLS structural equation modelling techniques have become one of the most important recent developments in multivariate analysis and are now widely used. The findings and results of SmartPLS for this research are provided in the following section. These methods used include t-test analysis, correlation analysis, factor analysis, path coefficients, etc.</span></p>

Most respondents based on education level were undergraduate 42.5%, followed by diploma level with 32.5%, respondents from postgraduate 15.5% and 9.5% were from high school level. Looking forward to occupation, 41.0% of respondents were from the private sector, while 26.5% were from the government sector. The self-employed and unemployed shows that each of them almost shows the same percentage equation where self-employed with 17.5% of respondents and 13.5% of respondents were unemployed, and 1.5% of respondents were from retirement. Next, the majority 29.5% were from respondents that come with a monthly income below IDR 7 million, 28.0% of respondent's incomes were below IDR 10,5 million, monthly income more than IDR 10,5 million, 22.0% of respondents and 20.5% were below IDR 3,5 million of monthly income. Based on work experience, the majority 45.5% of respondents have experience of more than six years, while 24.5% of respondents have 1-3 years of experience, 17.5% of respondents were below one year, and 12.5% of respondents had about 4-6 years of experience in work. And in terms of the nature of the job, the majority, 74.5% of respondents, were permanent employment, 15.0% of respondents were temporarily employed, and none were 10.5% of respondents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The structural model analysis data were processed using SmartPLS to create a conceptual framework for this research. The findings and results of SmartPLS come from factor loading analysis, Pathway analysis (direct and indirect effect of variables), R-Square (%) analysis, the significance of research (bootstrapping) and the goodness of FIT indexes.

<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This research challenges the notion of organizational culture within the framework of a service-oriented approach to commercial services. The poll was measured statistically using Google Forms distributed via social media - Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram applications, with around 200 respondents. The service-oriented strategy had an extremely positive and direct effect on business services, while the higher service-oriented strategy had additional effects on organizational readiness and knowledge exchange among responders. Researchers have reached their intended goal, allowing them to conclude that the majority of participants agreed that one organizational preparation and information sharing fully mediate their relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Below are the results of the structural analysis that was improved based on the outer loading through Smart PLS. We stated that a few items and variables need to be eliminated from this research because of the negative factor loading. The variables that have already been eliminated from this journal are Knowledge Sharing (KSH) and Process Aware Information Systems (PAIS). As for the items that have already been eliminated from this journal are BUP2 and BUP5 from the Independent Variable of Business Processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Businesses employing a service-oriented strategy were encouraged to consult this report. For organizational and corporate success, the researcher recommended that the service component have autonomous operations, including metrics and processes for motivation, performance, and accountability. Governance is essential for building business service-oriented initiatives in order to enhance the performance of business services. Aside from that, it will also assist them in determining whether the identified factors have an effect on trust and customer satisfaction. The service-based sector is most closely associated with business services. Through the business services they offer, service-oriented firms seek to delight customers, produce and deliver customer value (e.g., service quality and service value) in the marketplace, and enhance their company's performance and profitability. In order to meet the ever-increasing demands of investors, employees, and consumers, business organizations are continuously under pressure to assess and enhance their performance in competitive markets. As a result, businesses partition their organization and related business services into smaller, selfsufficient company components that can interact to optimize efficiency. In order to be capable of providing excellent services, business services must clearly adhere to business-oriented strategies.</span></p>
