<p><span class="font6">Colchicine treatments of 0.005% and 0.01% either in distilled water or in hydrogen peroxide 3% were caused temporary leaf shape changes on cowpea. Treatment of colchicine in hydrogen peroxide 3% resulted in green pod color change to purple however treatment of just hydrogen peroxide 3% and colchicine in hydrogen peroxide 3% caused 8.8-10.7% dwarf cowpea. As a preliminary data, we also observed that cowpea crops grown from seeds treated with colchicine in distillate water attacked by bean leaf beetle much earlier compare to the treatment with colchicine in hydrogen peroxide 3%.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Mutagenesis have been applied in various fields of research both for development of academic and applied purposes such as genetic modification using mutagen </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in vivo</span><span class="font6"> or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font6"> condition, random or targeted, molecular or non molecular to see cell-shaped changes, number of chromosomes, and or decreasing or increasing stomata numbers per leaf in the aim to improve plant quality. Genetic modification on plant by inducing mutagenesis is potential to improve plant quality considering that the process is</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">relatively simple and does not cost much (Oladosu </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">., 2016 ; Roychoduwry and Tah, 2016). Parry </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">., 2009 also mentioned about the important benefit of mutagenesis is to increase flora biodiversity through creating novelty and superior crop cultivar. The discovery of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</span><span class="font6"> site-directed mutagenesis technique doesn’t mean </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in vivo </span><span class="font6">mutagenesis techniques are not needed anymore as Chopra, (2005) mentioned that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in vivo</span><span class="font6"> mutagenesis techniques provide many advantages such as giving possibility to create mutant that having varying degrees of characteristic modification and sequence</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">analysis of mutant plants will deepen understanding relationship between plant genotype and phenotype.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Induced mutagenesis research started at the time colchicine was invented in year 1940 producing superior plant through chromosome doubling. In an effort to improve plant quality, beneficial mutation that produced through colchicine induced mutagenesis have generated quite a lot of new crop varieties that having better phenotypic characteristics.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>MATERIALS AND METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Before the main research we did a preliminary study that was colchicine treatment in distillate water solvent on cowpea seeds. In our main research we did four kind treatments of colchicine on cowpea seeds i.e. 1) cowpea seed treatment with a colchicine solution of 0.005% in distillate water solvent, 2) cowpea seed treatment with a colchicine solution of 0.01% in distillate water solvent, 3) cowpea seed treatment with a colchicine solution of 0.005% in 3% hydrogen peroxide (H</span><span class="font3">2</span><span class="font6">O</span><span class="font3">2</span><span class="font6">) solvent and 4) cowpea seed treatment with a colchicine solution of 0.01% in 3% hydrogen peroxide solvent. After 72 hours soaking, all growing sprout were planted in the field. Parameters measured were phenotypic vegetative and generative changes and pests attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Preliminary research result</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The colchicine treatment on cowpea from preliminary research showed that colchicine in distillate water treatment caused cotyledons enlargement on cowpea seed sprouts which can be considered as a visual evidence that something has happened genetically in this case the possibility of chromosome doubling. There are quite a lot of publicity to do with the treatment of colchicine as chromosome doubling agent that supports above result as Comai (2005) stated that in general polyploid plant having better vigor compare to native varieties. After those sprouts being planted there were leaf shape changed from normal shaped (lanceolate) to heart-shaped (Fig. 1). Those leaves shape changed were in temporary manner, afterward next leaves grow normal, flowering and then producing pods. The effect of colchicine on cowpea apparently was not just on the number of chromosomes. Colchicine in this research look like causing DNA damage resulted in leaf-shaped changed which then can be cured by cowpea DNA repair system.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Up to day 11 growth of cowpea grown from seeds treated with colchicine 0.005%, 0.01% and control crops showed almost no difference visually. Leaf-shaped changes from normal leaf-shaped (lanceolate) to heart-shaped and leaf malformation then occurred on crops treated with 0.01% colchicine (Fig. 2). We have found this kind of leaf-shaped changing in our preliminary research as we mentioned above. Leaf-shaped change due to colchicine treatment logically can be happen. Amiri </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">. (2010) in their publication stated that polyploidy genome could lead to large scale reorganization and subsequently led to various changes in phenotype both in vegetative and generative parts of the plant.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Colchicine in 3% hydrogen peroxide (H</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">) treatment</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Hydrogen peroxide 3% itself caused leaf malformation and this showed hydrogen peroxide 3% could cause genetic changes on cowpea. As an analog comparison, Ruiz-Laguna and Pueyo (1999) reported that hydrogen peroxide treatment could induces transverse mutation G:C</span><span class="font1">→</span><span class="font6">T:A in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Eschericia coli</span><span class="font6">. Colchicine in hydrogen peroxide 3% initially slowed the growth of cowpea. Cowpea seed treated with colchicine in 3% hydrogen peroxide solvent compare to control (cowpea seed treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide only) showed very difference growth. At the time control cowpea crops had grown as high as 4-7cm, colchicine treated cowpea has not grown yet. Both colchicine in distillate water and colchicine in 3% hydrogen peroxide caused leaf-shaped changed from lanceolate to heartshaped. Besides, colchicine in 3% hydrogen peroxide solvent caused other change in leaf shape </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz</span><span class="font6"> from lanceolate to oval (Fig. 3 A).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those both two kinds of leaf change were</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">temporary.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Many cowpea crop becoming stunted (Fig. 3 B) due to just 3% hydrogen peroxide treatment and colchicine in 3% hydrogen peroxide. Cowpea with leaf shape change could grow normally however stunted cowpea crop could not grow well meaning that the DNA damage due to colchicine treatment could not be repaired by cowpea DNA repair system. Detail data on the percentage of stunted crops are presented in Table 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is something new in the sense of colchicine which should increase the size of plant with its ability to induced chromosome doubling on plant which expected increasing the size of plant</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">in this research showed the opposite result that caused plant stunting. It is obviously understood from this research that colchicine in distillate water did not caused stunted plant however colchicine in 3% hydrogen peroxide did.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Pests Attacks</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Pests attacks were given a special attention in this research, hoping colchicine treatment giving any initial discovery of mutant cowpea that resistant to certain pest. Soil worm (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrotis ipsilon</span><span class="font6">) which intersecting the base of the cowpea stem underground attacked 3% hydrogen peroxide treated crop however did not found attacking colchicine treated crops (Fig. 5 A). Aphids attacked on cowpea grown from seeds treated with 0.005% colchicine in distillated water occurred on day 24 after planting. Cowpea crop grown from seeds treated with 0.01% colchicine in 3% hydrogen peroxide was also attacked by aphids however on day 32 after planting or eight days later (Fig. 5 B).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It wasn’t any bean leaf beetle (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Phaedonia inclusa</span><span class="font6">) symptoms found in cowpea crop grown from seeds treated with colchicine in</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">3% hydrogen peroxide up to 25 days after planting however symptoms of bean leaf beetle have appeared on cowpea crop treated with colchicine in distillate water 7 days after planting. Those results, although still require further evidence can be considered as promising preliminary result for developing crop resistant to soil worm and aphid through inducing mutagenesis using colchicine or other mutagens in hydrogen peroxide. Ranney and Jones (2008) stated that the increase in number of chromosomes could possibly increase the production of secondary metabolites and chemicals for plant self-deffence that will ultimately improve plant resistance to plat pests and diseases.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Furthermore, we found that seed treatment with colchicine 0.01% in 3% hydrogen peroxide on cowpea caused color pod change from green to purple (Fig. 6). Odekola and Oluleye (2007) has conducted a research inducing mutagenesis using gamma ray on cowpea resulted in mutant cowpea</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">with dark green, twisted and hairy pod. We consider that pod color changing due to colchicine treatment of this research having high academic value and might be economic value as well. Purple pod of cowpea may contain more antioxidant and for sure will increase biodiversity.</span></p>
