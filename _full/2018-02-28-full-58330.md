<p><span class="font2">The design of maternity clinics is due to the high number of pregnant women in Denpasar by the number 16,855 people out of 71,720 people on the island of Bali. (Bali Provincial Government Health Service 2016). Therefore, with the large number of pregnant women in the city of Denpasar, the idea is needed to continue to deliver normally than Caesarean delivery, because most Caesarean births are found in Denpasar City amounted to 4,195 cases from 12,860 cases in the Province of Bali. (Hospital Information System at Bali Provincial Health Service 2015). Caesarean delivery is made aware of the fear of labor pain so that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">gentle birth method will help a mother feel comfortable and safe when giving birth both in terms of physical and physiological.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The design method begins with the determination of ideas in accordance with the design topic then the data is collected either from print media or existing electronic media, looking for local regulations or regulations that are relevant to the topic of the discussion or conducting a study of similar facilities by observing and interviewing the speakers Then the data is analyzed according to data obtained from the field both quantitative data and qualitative data. Determine the design specifications and architectural programming both the space or site program in accordance with the design topic accompanied by the determination of design criteria in accordance with the object to be designed. Furthermore, in the final project stage the design topic is made systematically</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theme of Design</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The theme used in the design of a maternity clinic is natural living which aims to provide a sense of comfort and safety for pregnant women and toddlers to move by considering harmony with the surrounding environment while still giving a clean impression on the clinic[1]. The application of themes to the design was developed through the concept of homey with the following mapping (Figure 1).</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Fig. 1. Theme (source: Cahyani:2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The concept is applied based on the following points namely prioritizing friendliness, privacy of the building or space, use of furniture with soft material and avoiding corners, use of natural and soft colors, use of environmentally friendly materials and anti-slip and the presence of open space that functions as a park to reduce the level of civitas stress.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concept</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The concept of homey in building masses in the maternity clinic aims to give a nuance of the house with orientation to the building, namely the presence of parks as the main focus or the liaison between building masses with one another like the arrangement of building masses in a Balinese house (Figure 2).</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/58330-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:240pt;height:132pt;">

<p><span class="font0">Fig. 2. Perspective (source: Cahyani:2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">materials that give the impression of friendliness (welcome) as well as being open which is applied by maximizing the use of high and wide glass material so as to give the impression of an open and non-curbing building. The combination of colors is also important from this homey concept, which is by combining soft colors such as brown, green, blue or other natural colors that can give a relaxed impression on the building.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interior Design</span></p></li></ul>

In public spaces, the concept of homey is focused on the use of furniture, the combination of soft colors and the presence of voids in buildings to avoid the impression of pressure (Figure 4).</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/58330-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:232pt;height:119pt;"><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/58330-5.jpg" alt="" style="width:241pt;height:157pt;">

(Figure 5).</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/58330-6.jpg" alt="" style="width:226pt;height:324pt;">
