<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LITERATURE REVIEW</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Define the tourist: between evidence and needs for precision</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Tourism is the subject of much research and evaluation at the national or international level. However, tourism remains under-theoretical (Liburd, 2002; Demen-Meyer, 2005) and defining tourism has long been a challenge for those studying this field (Boyer, 1972). Whether it is a question of quantifying flows, measuring the importance of recurrent and emerging practices, or identifying motivations for choosing destinations and activities, one of the priorities is to be able to accurately identify the subject of study (Williams, 2004). So who is the author of these so-called &quot;tourist&quot; trips and stays? Who can be classified as a tourist?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Beyond the answers that come spontaneously (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font4">: &quot;foreigners&quot;; &quot;holidaymakers who come to us&quot;; &quot;we ourselves when we go elsewhere&quot;; &quot;everyone&quot;) and which refer to the so-called &quot;popular&quot; definition (Leiper, 1993), the qualification of tourist status must be considered with finesse and rigour to meet academic and technical ambitions. It is not enough to ask the question &quot;where do you live? &quot;and to note the difference between the place of study and nationality. Indeed, being a tourist goes beyond the simple fact</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of coming from an area of geographical or administrative origin different from the one in which you are currently living. It is also necessary to consider the time dimension of the stay. It is also necessary to take into account the motivations and activities that are carried out in this geographical area of temporary residence. These three dimensions make it possible to explain and understand more precisely the variations in tourist behaviour and reactions. Their knowledge then allows and implies the necessary adaptations both for the management of receiving and sending tourism companies and for the economic and social development of the destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Considering this need for a detailed definition of the tourist, this chapter is divided into two stages. First, the ambition is to recall the context and issues that have governed the selection of the criteria for characterizing the statistical unit of tourism that is the individual tourist. Secondly, it is a question of specifying the three perimeters, spatial, temporal and functional (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font4"> motivations and activities) that must be considered in order to precisely define tourists and thus better situate their expectations and needs in view of the different tourist populations they constitute.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Context, issues and definition of the tourist</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">After a presentation of the structuring of UNTWO and its participation in the development of a harmonised and usable reference framework for the measurement of tourism by all nations, the definitions of the four reference tourist units are presented.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>The progressive structuring of definitions</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">If the need for definitions was expressed in 1934 by the International Union of Official Tourist Propaganda Organizations and confirmed by the Council of the League of Nations in 1937, this need became more acute after the Second World War. Indeed, the world that was being rebuilt was relying in part on tourism to re-establish peaceful exchanges between countries and nations. Thus, in 1954, what is now UNWTO (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">United Nation World Tourism Organization</span><span class="font4">) participated in the United Nations Conference on Customs Formalities to facilitate and promote tourism. And it was at the initiative of this supranational body that, in 1963, at the United Nations conference in Rome, technical cooperation and the promotion of freedom of movement were discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this post-war period, the argument for tourism development is based above all on economic potential (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i.e. </span><span class="font4">tourism as a vehicle for development) and on the strengthening of interindividual and multicultural exchanges (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font4"> tourism as a vehicle for peace thanks to the increased sociability between inhabitants of the various nations and between inhabitants of the various regions within each nation). Today, the argument in support of tourism development is broadened since there is a regular discussion, especially since 2017, which was the International Year of Tourism for Sustainable Development, of highlighting the contribution of tourism to raising awareness of the need to protect the environment and preserve local cultures (Highlights UNTWO 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To meet these challenges of promoting tourism, it is necessary to be able to demonstrate the usefulness of tourism to leaders and political actors in all countries of the world. The prerequisites are therefore to be able, on the one hand, to prove its quantitative importance on a global and country-bycountry basis and, on the other hand, to be able to assess, in figures, the economic and social development potential for each destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As an economically studied phenomenon (Py, 2007), it is a question of how to measure volumes and flows of travellers. In the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">end,</span><span class="font4"> this makes it possible to calculate the direct and indirect economic benefits linked to these volumes by using figures relating to overnight stays and tourist visitor spending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As such, five key figures related to economic development are regularly highlighted at the global level: 1) the number of jobs, 2) the weight in world GDP, 3) the turnover of world exports linked to international tourism activity, 4) the share that this represents in total world exports, and 5) the relative share if we consider only exports of services. Thus, for 2017, UNTWO announces performances that are respectively: 1 in 10 jobs in the world is related to tourism, tourism represents 10% of world GDP, which reaches 1,400 billion Dollar (USD) of world exports, or 7% of world exports for tourism alone, and corresponds to 30% of exports of services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A historical review of the structure and actions of UNWTO, summarized in a table (Table 1), shows the steps in the pursuit of this characterization objective for international measurement purposes. A quick reading of this table reveals three key dates in the history of the conceptualization and statistical</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">measurement of tourism:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1963</span><span class="font4">, with the Rome Conference, where the recommendations made by what would later become UNWTO, to define the tourist and to distinguish him from other related concepts such as the visitor, the traveller and the excursionist, were accepted by the United Nations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1991, </span><span class="font4">with the Ottawa conference, where the principle of building a common &nbsp;and harmonized global</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">reference &nbsp;framework for tourism</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">measurement methods at the national and international levels was validated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, this intention is not translated into a priority and is only really operationalized as from 2004 with the decision of the United Nations Statistical Commission (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Official Records of the Economic and Social Council</span><span class="font4"> 2004, Supplement No. 4 (E/2004/24), Chap. III C. para.6 (c and d)) to design a set of recommendations for tourism statistics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">a. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2008, </span><span class="font4">with the proposal by UNTWO for a tourism glossary that is the result of two years of work by the international community (UNWTO, 2005/2007).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ambition is to propose definitions and classifications that can be integrated into all national tourism</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">statistics systems. Despite the priority given to measurement, however, economics is no longer the only grid to be used, since these conceptual and statistical recommendations aim to provide a common basis for all research and surveys on tourism, whether the prism is social, cultural or economic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These international recommendations were finally and definitively approved by the United Nations in 2014. They are the subject of the publication in 2016 of the &quot;IRTS 2008 Compilation Guide&quot; which is, to date, the standard to be used.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The four statistical reference units: traveller, visitor, tourist and excursionist</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the basis of the conclusions that UNTWO has sought to collect in the IRTS 2008, the definitions distinguish four statistical units: the traveller, the visitor, the tourist, and the excursionist. Extracted and translated from Annex 1 of the version published by the United Nations, in the four definitions we are now quoting, the words in italics correspond to the key ideas and terms underlying these conceptualizations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traveller </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(&quot;</span><span class="font4">traveller&quot;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">):</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">A traveller is a person who </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">travels </span><span class="font4">between different geographical locations for any reason and for any duration (IRTS 2008, para.2.4).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This definition includes, in travellers, people in migration, which required, since 1993, to distinguish tourist flows within other flows related to international migration. To identify the tourist among other travellers, it is therefore necessary to go further and make more precise categorizations (those below).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visitor </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(&quot;</span><span class="font4">visitor&quot;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">):</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">According to IRTS 2008 (para. 2.9), a visitor is a traveller who travels to a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">main destination</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">different from his or her usual environment</span><span class="font4">, for less than one year, for </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font3">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;overnight visitor</span><span class="font4">&quot;):</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the IRTS 2008 (para. 2.13), a tourist is a visitor (domestic, entering or leaving the country or region in question) whose trip includes at </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">least one overnight stay at destination</span><span class="font4">. But his stay in the destination must not exceed one year.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(iii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excursionist </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font4"> same-day visitor</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">An excursionist is a visitor (domestic, entering or leaving the country or region in question) whose journey takes place during the day. This </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">round trip on the same day</span><span class="font4"> means that there is no overnight stay in the main destination. This is the main distinction made with tourists (IRTS 2008, para.2.13).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While this distinction makes sense for the estimation of paid nights and the full calculation of the economic benefits for the host destination, it does not necessarily imply major differences in the visitor's activities. Indeed, whether with or without overnight stay, the excursionist and the </span><span class="font3">143 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e-ISSN: 2407-392X. p-ISSN: 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tourist are two visitors who can present extremely similar profiles in terms of motivations to come and activities (discovery of high places, participation in fairs and events) and types of consumption (purchases of tourist guidance services, purchases of private transport services, food purchases in CHR, coffee hotels and restaurants, or VAE, takeaway sales, souvenir purchases).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The perimeters of the tourist's characterization</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The key elements to be taken into account to distinguish the tourist from other travellers are therefore the trip that refers to the spatial perimeter, the duration of the trip that refers to the temporal perimeter, and the function of the trip that refers to the activities and motivations of the visitor. After placing these three criteria in the process of distinguishing the tourist from other travellers, the implications of these three perimeters are detailed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Three criteria to distinguish the tourist from other travellers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">introduction, he recalled that &quot;tourism is a social, cultural and economic phenomenon that involves the movement of people to countries or places outside their usual environment for personal, professional or business purposes. These people are called visitors (and can be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tourists</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">excursionists</span><span class="font4">, residents and non- residents) and tourism refers to their activities, some of which involve </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tourism spending</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are talking about tourists and excursionists, but also residents and nonresidents. To capture what distinguishes them from each other, and taking into account the four fundamental statistical units of the traveller, visitor, tourist, and excursionist, Figure 1 shows the importance of the following elements: 1) the movement of the place where one usually lives (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i.e. where</span><span class="font4"> we are considered inhabitants), 2) the reason for this trip and, in particular, the fact of not being forced or wishing to leave this place permanently, and 3) the duration of this trip, in terms of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">maximum duration</span><span class="font4"> (3a) to differentiate between the tourist and the resident, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">minimum duration</span><span class="font4"> (3b) to identify excursionists among tourists.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>From concepts and classifications to fluctuating indicators</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">As already noted, the UNTWO definitions are based on concepts and classifications aimed at differentiating tourism flows and activities from other migratory flows and at assessing the importance of the tourism-related labour market. Thus, taking into account the classifications and indicators used for other economic activities, it is necessary to be able to incorporate the measurement of tourism into all countries' national accounts and to promote the comparability of results between nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, these international harmonization efforts are hampered by the reality of local diversity. Indeed, there are sometimes major disparities between countries, in population density, accessibility to transport modes, cultural behaviour, and distances between administrative and national borders. For example, the distances to be covered when travelling in Cyprus, the United States or Finland are not easily comparable, neither in terms of distance per kilometre, nor even in terms of travel time (especially if the weather of the season has an impact on travel times and modes). Therefore, the criterion of distance in kilometres may not be of any use in characterizing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">usual environment,</span><span class="font4"> one of the concepts essential to the definition of a tourist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As an illustration, Table 2 presents the variations identified by the Ministry of Tourism of Egypt on the criteria that are used to define what this concept of &quot;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the usual environment</span><span class="font4">&quot; means. It shows that each country defines this concept in a specific way. Sometimes, the specification is a single criterion. Sometimes it is multicriteria. Although using a unifying concept, the criteria used to operationalize this same concept are different from one country to another.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>The necessary variability of indicators to adapt to each country</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">As already noted, the proposed and internationally appropriate definitions recommend that the same concepts be used. Thus, let us recall here the definition (IRTS 2008, para. 2.9 and para. 2.13) which stipulates that one is a tourist if one is &quot;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a visitor</span><span class="font4"> who </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">spends less than one year and more than one night</span><span class="font4"> at destination, i.e. that one is a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">traveller</span><span class="font4"> who moves to a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">main place which is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">different from one's usual environment</span><span class="font4">&quot;. However, the establishment and operational specification of these different concepts are not always identical from one country to another. On the contrary, they can fluctuate, which necessarily has an impact on the final qualification of who is a tourist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But then, if the operationalization of the concepts of the tourist definition varies from one country to another, how can we be sure that the tourist is defined in a harmonized way at the international level? Can we really compare the statistical results of different countries? More generally, can we rely on these definitions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The answer to this essential question of the reliability of international definitions of tourist is fortunately positive. Indeed, although worrying at first sight, the national variability of the indicators for the technical implementation of the characterization of the mobilized concepts is in fact a guarantee of finesse in the local granularity of the international definition of the tourist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If we take again the example of the comparison between Cyprus, the United States and Finland, the distance per kilometre makes sense in the United States where roads are generally accessible all </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font3">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">year round and where both motorway and car equipment are important when, on the other hand, the criteria used will add a notion of daily regularity of travel for Cyprus, and prefer the notion of weekly frequency for Finland only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus, each country offers criteria adapted to its geomorphological originality, but also to the cultural habits, residential leisure practices and the usual forms of local mobility of its inhabitants. This is particularly relevant for considering global studies on international tourist activities (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i.e. taking into</span><span class="font4"> account what is technically possible to do in each destination according to its local characteristics) but also for comparisons of the practices and performances of domestic tourism (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i.e. taking into</span><span class="font4"> account what is recurrent to find in the holiday and tourist practices of the different countries and geographical areas considered).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In conclusion, behind the variability of the indicators used by each country, there is always the ambition to have locally relevant information to find the meaning associated with the concepts underlying the international definition of tourist. In the case of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">usual environment</span><span class="font4"> (Table 2), all countries have endeavoured to identify criteria that would enable them not to assimilate the tourist to a resident, and to be assured that the host</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">destination is indeed different from that of a place of customary life. Even if it is expressed differently in each country, this idea of the unusual, which is based on the observation that there is always a part of the quest for an alternative place symbolically different from the tourist's daily life (Boyer, 2011), is therefore always well taken into account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The researcher and the practitioner can therefore rely on the statistical definitions and operationalizations, as designed by UNTWO, for their work and studies since they effectively make it possible to find the important characteristics of the tourist.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The stability of the three perimeters to be considered to characterize the tourist</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Qualified here as perimeters since they allow the tourist to be located in relation to other residents and inhabitants and in relation to other travellers, the consideration of three elements allows a tourist to be well characterized. Insofar as these three elements have always been used to describe a tourist (Boyer, 2005), and insofar as these three elements remain stable and valid in all countries of the world, they represent the opportunity to consider ontologically the status of tourist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These three perimeters are: 1) the spatial perimeter with the notion of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">displacement</span><span class="font4">; 2) the temporal perimeter with the notion of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">duration of the </span><span class="font4">displacement, and 3) the functional perimeter. The latter perimeter refers to the function of travel for the traveller, i.e. the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">motivations</span><span class="font4"> for his or her travel and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">activities</span><span class="font4"> he or she engages in during the trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Their consideration allows for a shortened qualification, or even an ontology of the &quot;tourist being&quot;, which could be the following: the tourist is an individual, from elsewhere, who will not settle down, and who acts in a particular way on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We specify below these three perimeters and what we must try to capture beyond the variations in the indicators for those who want to carry out studies and research on tourism as a social and cultural fact. The goal is thus to ensure that participants are selected who are indeed individuals with the distinctive characteristics of what a tourist is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Spatial perimeter: from the country of residence and the usual environment to the measurement of incoming and outgoing flows</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The founding concepts used in tourism statistics, which reflect the spatial dimension, are the terms &quot;reference country&quot;, &quot;country or place of usual residence&quot;, &quot;principal residence&quot; and &quot;nationality&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Be outside the place of residence and the usual environment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These concepts in relation to the residence make it possible to classify visitors according to their place of origin and therefore to specify the different forms of tourism. A clear distinction must be made and the notion of place of residence must be given priority over that of nationality. Nationality refers to the information available on the passport or other administrative document. Conversely, the place of usual residence, or principal residence, is the geographical location where the person resides most regularly. This concept is less definitive and more flexible than that of nationality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A step further, the notion of the individual's usual environment, a key concept to define the tourist that we have already mentioned, refers to the geographical area, which is not necessarily continuous, within which the individual carries out the routines of a regular life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is therefore the fact that the individual is spatially outside the geographical spaces associated with the regularity of a routine rhythm of life that allows him/her to be granted the status of a tourist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This characterization by the spatial perimeter </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">outside its usual environment </span><span class="font4">aims to exclude from the tourism accounts, individuals who travel in a monotonous and usual way to go from their place of life to their place of employment or study, and, more generally, all those who travel frequently, whatever the spaces considered, according to a routine logic (whether to see their family, go to commercial, medical or religious areas). This applies even if the distance covered is substantial. The usual environment therefore includes the family living space, but also the employment and study areas and all other places visited on a regular basis. One of the purposes of this qualification is to exclude from tourist counts all cross-border workers and all travellers who make round trips for work and study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Holiday homes and second homes</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Imagine French retirees who spend most of the year in Morocco to enjoy a milder climate. Throughout this winter period, their usual and routine place of residence is Morocco and no longer </span><span class="font3">149 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e-ISSN: 2407-392X. p-ISSN: 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">France. Two questions arise here: what is the main place of residence, and how to locate travel to holiday homes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The issue of principal residence is easy to address since it is sufficient to know where they spend the most time in a year, i.e. at least 6 months and 1 day. Thus, while the concept of the principal residence is primarily spatial, it appears that its practical operationalization requires the introduction of the temporal dimension since the principal residence is where the person spends most of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The issue of holiday homes is more complex since it is a special case of regular travel. Indeed, since these houses and second homes are the object of periodic and recurrent travel, should they be integrated into the usual environment and excluded from tourist trips?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The expenses and activities related to stays in these holiday homes and other second homes appear specific. Therefore, the statistical authorities recommend, to date, to count them as tourist trips but to ensure that they are distinguished within these tourist trips. For example, in France, by convention, travel to a secondary residence is considered to be tourist travel outside the usual environment (Mémento du Tourisme, 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From a practical point of view for the researcher and practitioner, this means that it is important to ask respondents to specify what their accommodation is: Is it a family or secondary residence? Is it a dwelling that he regularly occupies and how many days does he spend there per year?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Finally, in the current context of innovative forms of residential sharing or free accommodation (see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">couchsurfing</span><span class="font4">), it may be important to cross-reference tourist flow data with data on holiday accommodation at the destination level. Even if this information may seem remote from the initial investigation project, asking about the accommodation chosen is ultimately an important factor to be taken into account in any study aimed at understanding and explaining tourist behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">International inward and outward flow accounting</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the data related to the spatial perimeter, nationality makes it possible to measure international arrivals. This involves calculating the number of tourists from other countries returning to a given country. On a global scale, this makes it possible, among other things, to identify the most important receiving areas and their evolution in terms of attractiveness (see Figure 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It should be noted that these assessments made at the entrance to a national territory do not represent the number of international visitors but the number of national borders crossed by all visitors. Thus, a German citizen who crosses France by car for a holiday in Spain will be counted twice as an international arrival for France. And this, even if he only transits without staying in France. He will be counted once when he travels from Germany to Spain, and a second time at the end of his holidays when he returns from Spain to Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">International tourist arrivals are therefore somewhat biased data that should be considered with caution. What about the real economic benefits of some international arrivals? What relevance would it have to consider development strategies for tourist reception if we were to rely solely on these data?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tourism typologies resulting from the spatial perimeter</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More generally, concepts related to the spatial perimeter make it possible to distinguish the three forms of reference tourism which are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inbound tourism (inbound tourism). It includes activities related to travel within the site, travel made by nonresident visitors to that reference site.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outbound &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tourism &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(outbound</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">tourism). It includes the activities of visitors residing in the reference place when they travel outside that reference place.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic tourism (or domestic tourism). It includes the activities of a visitor who is a resident of the reference place when travelling within that reference place.</span></p>
<div><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/58960-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:445pt;height:199pt;">
<p><span class="font3">Figure 2. International tourist arrivals in 2017 (in millions) and change from 2016 (in %) (AFP UNTWO)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">By extension, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">international tourism </span><span class="font4">includes incoming and outgoing tourism. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Domestic tourism </span><span class="font4">includes domestic (resident) and incoming (non-resident) tourism. Finally, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">national tourism </span><span class="font4">includes domestic and outgoing tourism: the activities of resident visitors during their tourist trips in their reference country and activities related to their tourist trips outside their reference country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The temporal perimeter: Temporary residence (more than one night and less than one year)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As shown in Figure 1, the temporary nature of the trip is an essential factor in characterizing the tourist. More than one night and less than one year are the consensus rules now systematically applied. These temporal boundaries make it possible to separate tourist visitors from migrants who do not plan to return to their initial place of main residence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, a finer temporal granularity than this broad boundary, which ranges from one day to one year, is often useful in order to be able to categorize tourist visitors in order to consider truly adapted reception and development strategies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Indeed, depending on the duration of travel and stay, visitors' behaviour changes. During the first few days, foreign to the area and unaware of local customs</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and habits, visitors have needs for assistance and expectations that will evolve as they become accustomed to and immersed in the visiting environment. What is of the order of the unusual will gradually transform into a form of second habitual environment. From then on, their behaviour will change and no longer be that of a first-time visitor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore, even for visitors who no longer have a principal residence in the administrative sense, the concept of principal residence makes it possible to define what their reference location is. And even for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">digital nomads</span><span class="font4">, who could be classified as professional holidaymakers (or professionals still on holiday...) since they move from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">coworkation</span><span class="font4"> to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">coworking</span><span class="font4"> areas all over </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font4"> world all year round (Marinos </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al., </span><span class="font4">2019), it is possible to identify their main place of residence from the area and country in which they have stayed the longest over the past 12 months. It is true, however, that these new professional practices and employment relations question international classifications on tourist travel.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The functional perimeter: The activities and motivations of the tourist</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Faced with the complexity of the tourism object, Georges Cazes (1992) stresses the importance of taking into account the functions of tourism for the traveller. The last of the three principles that distinguish tourists from other travellers and visitors is therefore that of motivations and activities (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font4"> the functional perimeter).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Indeed, in relation to the expectations he places in his trip and taking into account the reality of his practices during the trip and stay, the tourist adopts a different behaviour from other travellers. Its buyer profile and consumption are specific. And behavioural differences are expressed in the choice of activities. Among these, among others, there is a part, sometimes minimal but almost always present, of research to discover local culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is in this logic of qualifying the tourist by his practices during the trip that the concept of &quot;main reason for the tourist trip&quot; has been proposed. It should be considered that, without this main reason, there would not have been any travel (IRTS 2008, para. 3.10.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Beyond the positive list of personal reasons and goals that may govern the intention to travel (see Box 1), it is also necessary to highlight the criterion that excludes from tourist status. This excluding criterion is that of having an employer-employee relationship with an entity resident in the destination visited. A seasonal employee may behave in a similar way to a tourist since, during these holidays, he or she may seek to discover the local culture and visit the tourist highlights of the place of employment. While, in this respect, it seems appropriate to associate it with tourists to study their common expectations of discovering local heritage and culture, by convention, it is now considered that a seasonal employee should never be considered and measured as a tourist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As already mentioned above, this criterion of the relationship to employment is undoubtedly the one that could in the future be called into question or, at least, re-defined and adapted to match current and future developments in forms of work. Finally, in order to consider strategies to enhance the attractiveness of destinations that are perfectly adapted to the specificities and expectations of the targeted visitors, according to a segmented marketing approach (Petr, 2015), in addition to the main reason for travel, it is</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">necessary to identify and also consider the secondary activities carried out by tourists. This is particularly relevant for studies aimed at managing the attractiveness of the destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Box 1 -The main reason for a tourist trip</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The main reason for a tourist trip is defined as the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">main reason why the trip would not have taken place without it</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A tourist is a visitor (domestic, entering or leaving the country or place in question) who comes for any reason whatsoever: business, leisure or other personal purposes.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It can be conclude that contextualized and recalled the definitions of tourists based on the recommendations made since IRTS 2008 by the supranational organization for the promotion of tourism on a global scale (UNTWO).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These reminders were an opportunity to highlight the importance of allowing nations flexibility in the operationalization of the criteria to be mobilized for the founding concepts used to define tourists. It is important that each country be able to adapt, to its regional and national originality, the technical implementation of the concepts underlying the statistical measures of tourism. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">prerequisite</span><span class="font4"> for this local flexibility is that the principles and meaning of these internationally defined concepts are well understood and uniformly shared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition, the mention of the different perimeters to be considered highlighted some traveller configurations that need to be carefully examined during studies and research, such as retirees, cross-border workers or seasonal employees. This vigilance ensures that volume and flow measurements are accurate, and that subsequent assessments of the significance of the economic, social</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and cultural impact potentially induced by tourism activity are not underestimated or, on the contrary, overestimated. Beyond these guarantees of good estimates, taking into account the ideas underlying these perimeters also provides the certainty of carrying out valid sampling for research work on tourist populations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In perspective, we suggest that readers, researchers and practitioners consider and mobilize more subjective dimensions to assign an individual the status of tourist, in addition to the objective categories already used, spatial, temporal and by activities. These subjective complementary measures include, on the one hand, mental representations relating to the imaginary of the tourist character (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font4"> the figure of the tourist), and on the other hand, those dealing with the &quot;feeling of being (or not) a tourist&quot; and individual acceptance or denial of being a tourist. Thus, among those who can, objectively and statistically, be classified in the &quot;tourist&quot; box, who really perceives themselves as tourists? What does this mean for him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Considering this theme of representations of the tourist and being a tourist, it is a question of studying the tourist phenomenon from the point of view of the person who lives this travel experience, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font4"> the tourist, but also from</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the point of view of the person who receives this visitor, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i.e. the</span><span class="font4"> habitant. The study of dyadic relations between tourists and inhabitants seemed to be reserved for executives from distant and developing countries, subject to the pressure of tourist arrivals sometimes perceived as intrusive or colonialist. This problem seems to be spreading today to the Western world, which is nevertheless used to tourism (Martinez-Garcia, Raya, Majό, 2016; Petr, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In view of the continuous growth and unfailing resilience of tourism (Babu and Callot, 2019), and in view of the various anti-tourism measures or reactions recently expressed by inhabitants of various key destinations in Europe such as Barcelona, Dubrovnik, Venice, or even Bordeaux, etc., could the issue of tolerance and the feeling of tourist invasion by the inhabitants of old Europe become an investigation subject that will soon become impossible to ignore?</span></p>
