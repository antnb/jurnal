<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aims in this study, first is to find out verbal and non-verbal signs found in football shoes advertisements, and second is to analyze the meaning of verbal and non-verbal signs found in football shoes advertisements. The data sources from this study were taken from the Official Account of Nike, Puma, and Adidas. This study used the descriptive qualitative method. The data were analyzed based on the theory proposed by Saussure (1983) about sign elements, the theory from Barthes (1964) about the meaning of signs, and the supporting theory from Cerrato (2012) to analyze the color terms.

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Language is the aspect that usually uses by the human in their life. The function of language is to communicate with others. As stated by Finnegan and Besnier (1989) in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">An Introduction to Language and Linguistics </span><span class="font3">that the language is a finite system of elements and principles that make it possible for the speakers to construct sentences to do a particular communicative job. It explains that the main purpose of communication to deliver meaning. In linguistic, meaning is one of the studies that categorized into semantic. It is the branch of micro</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">linguistic and deals with the interpretation of the meaning of words, phrases, sentences, and signs (Leech: 1974). Semantic fields are useful tools to explain meaning of something (Eco, 1979: 80). Thus, it makes the scope of semantic is very large especially to analyze the meaning; one of them is called Semiotic. According to Saussure in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Basic of Semiotic</span><span class="font3"> (2007) explained that semiotic is the study of the role of signs as part of social life. Signs could be the form of words, images, gestures, sounds, and objects (Chandler: 2002). In general, the sign is used to deliver the idea to each other. The signs can be found in the advertisement to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">convey the meaning of the content of the advertisement to the readers. It often appears the implicit meaning of the advertisements. Therefore, as stated by Beasly &amp;&nbsp;Danesi (2002) the society needs to filter the meaning to get the real meaning which is delivered by the advertiser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Advertisement is the media to publish something to the public, it can be a brand, product service, event to attract the attention of the society who reads, watches, or hears the advertisement. Based on Dyer (1993) advertisement means how the day to draw attention to something or the way to inform somebody. According to Barthes (1998), there are two important elements of advertisements; they are verbal and nonverbal signs. The verbal signs include the written texts in written advertisements and it could be divided into slogan and body text (Goddart, 2002: 218). Meanwhile for non-verbal signs include images and color choice which is interesting depend on the culture of the reader in written advertisements (Wierzbicka: 1996).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This research focuses to analyze the verbal and non-verbal signs as well as the meaning of verbal and non-verbal signs found in football shoes advertisements found on google.com in the types of poster advertisements. The football shoes advertisements publish the brand of the shoes and it contains the written text and the images that relate with the football. Nevertheless, a lot of readers are still confused to comprehend the elements of the signs in the football shoes advertisements. Therefore, it is very challenging to analyze the use of signs in football shoes advertisements. The specific thing that this research focused on 1) to find out the verbal and nonverbal signs found in football shoes advertisements and 2) the meaning of verbal and non-verbal signs found in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">football shoes advertisements. By analyzing these advertisements, the researcher expects to give a better understanding of the elements which are used in football shoes advertisements.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>METHOD AND THEORY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Library research was conducted to analyze the data. The data in this research were taken from the internet at </span><a href="http://www.google.com/"><span class="font3">www.google.com.</span></a><span class="font3"> There are three data in this research which the data were downloaded from three official accounts to get the meaning from the different company about their every brand which is advertised. They are downloaded from the official account of Nike, Puma, and Adidas. In the process of collecting the data, the observation method is used to obtain detailed information. It is started by searching football shoes advertisements on the internet, reading and downloading them, classifying the part of verbal and non-verbal signs, and finding the meaning from that verbal and non-verbal signs. All of the analysis in this data in this research used the descriptive qualitative method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are many types of research about semiotics analysis on advertisements that have been conducted by researchers. They tend to analyze the verbal and non-verbal signs of the advertisements and as well as analyze the meaning of each sign. As it is done by Fathiyah (2018), she analyzed Axe Monday Perfume Advertisement. She found that the verbal and non-verbal signs are supporting one another. There are close relations of signifier and signified of the signs. These aspects of signs deliver the meaning of the advertisements properly whether as denotative or connotative meaning. In line with Fathiyah, Sena et all (2016) also analyze signs in Adidas advertisements. They found that the verbal and visual aspects have an important purpose such</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">as to give some information to people concerning the sign in the aim to know the message of signs in the advertisement. It was found that Adidas advertisements mostly used conceptual and expressive meaning to influence the feeling of the readers to believe their product. Therefore, it can persuade readers to buy the product from Adidas. Another research by Risaldi (2017) which analyzed the advertisement found in Now! Bali Magazine also stated the relation between signifier and signified to support the advertisement. She concluded every advertisement should choose excellent words and enchanting picture to attract the reader’ interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this research, there are several theories which are used, they are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Semiotic Theory from Saussure (1983) </span><span class="font3">Saussure classified a signed term into a signifier and signified in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Basic of Semiotics</span><span class="font3"> by Daniel Chandler. The distinction between those elements is:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A signifier is the form of the sign takes, it is the material form of the sign takes, such as language, letters, sounds, images, and symbols (Saussure: 1983) as stated in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Handbook of Semantic.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While for signified is the meaning of the signifier.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">For instance, according to quotation from Saussure (1966: 67) in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Course in General Linguistics,</span><span class="font3"> there is a sign of picture “tree” in the park. The signifier from this sign is the picture of tree. For the signified of this sign is the people who come to the park should take care to the tree around the park area.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Theory of Meaning from Barthes (1964)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Barthes in his book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Elements of Semiology</span><span class="font3"> developed the theory of</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denotative meaning is the primer meaning or the literal meaning of something. It is usually called the meaning based on the dictionary. For instance: the word &quot;woman&quot; has the denotative meaning of an adult female human (Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, 2005: 1692)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connotative meaning is the implicit meaning of something. The scope is larger than the denotative meaning. It could depend on the culture and perception of meaning from the reader or hearer. For instance, the word &quot;red and white&quot; in Indonesia as stated in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Filsafat Semiotika </span><span class="font3">(2014: &nbsp;205) has the connotative</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">meaning about the struggle for Indonesian against colonialism and can be implemented as the symbol of bravery.</span></p>
