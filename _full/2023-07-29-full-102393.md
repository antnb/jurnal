<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In order to realize the development of the Bali Province, the Bali Provincial Government implements regional policies with a development plan with a vision of:“</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nangun Sat Kerthi Loka Bali</span><span class="font1">”, which means “maintaining the sanctity and harmony of Balinese nature”</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font1">.<sup>1</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">There are 22 There are at least 22 (twenty-two) development missions that will be carried out in order to realize the vision of the Bali Provincial Government, namely realizing a prosperous and joyous life of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Krama Bali</span><span class="font1"> through patterned, comprehensive, planned, directed and integrated development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To carry out this development mission, the Bali Provincial Government issued various regional policies as the legal basis for implementation. One of the development missions is the development of the life of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Krama Bali</span><span class="font1"> in “the seen and the unseen” (which also known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sekala</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">niskala</span><span class="font1">) manner based on philosophical values of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sad Kertih</span><span class="font1">, namely </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Atma Kertih, Danu Kertih, Wana Kertih, Segara Kertih, Jana Kertih</span><span class="font1">, dan </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jagat Kertih</span><a href="#bookmark7"><span class="font1">.<sup>2</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">With regard to this development, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages have a great responsibility. In order to provide protection for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages in terms of implementing its governance, the Bali Province Regional Regulation No. 4 of 2019 concerning </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hereinafter</span><span class="font1"> Perda Desa Adat) was issued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">, it can be seen that the responsibility given by the Provincial Government of Bali to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages in regulating the management of Balinese manners is very crucial</span><a href="#bookmark8"><span class="font1">.<sup>3</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">It was reflected in Article 3 of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> that regulates the purpose of regulating </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> village by recognizing and respecting the position and the role of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages in the constitutional system of the Republic of Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the responsibilities of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village is the management of water sources, including </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pasisi</span><span class="font1"> or coastal area</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sagara</span><span class="font1"> or the sea, as regulated in the provisions of Article 25 paragraph (1) letterc c and d of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><a href="#bookmark9"><span class="font1">.<sup>4</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">The existence of authority in terms of the management of water sources, including </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pasisi</span><span class="font1"> or coastal area</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sagara </span><span class="font1">or the sea by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village has an impact on the development carried out in coastal areas in South Bali, especially in Denpasar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are several </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village that carry out the development of coastal area under its authority based on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">. However, the problem arises in the coastal areas in South Bali, especially in Denpasar, namely the Forest Park (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Taman Hutan Raya</span><span class="font1">) Ngurah Rai (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hereinafter</span><span class="font1"> Tahura Ngurah Rai). The development of Tahura Ngurah Rai has become a problem because there is a conflict of norm in the management of Tahura Ngurah Rai. According to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">, it can be seen that the authority to manage belongs to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village, however according to the Article 1 point 10 of the Regulation of the Minister of Environment and Forestry No: P.10/Menhut-II/2009 concerning Guidelines for Formulating a Grand Forest Park Management Plan determine that the authority to manage the forest park is delegated to the UPTD Tahura Ngurah Rai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some other problems arise concerning the management of coastal area of Tahura Ngurah Rai namely: </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">First</span><span class="font1">, development in the coastal area carried out by the Sesetan </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village is being in conflict with the rules for the protection block for the area of Tahura Ngurah Rai. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Second</span><span class="font1">, the development of coastal areas for construction work in Pedungan Village also clashes with the area of Tahura Ngurah Rai. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Third</span><span class="font1">, the development of coastal areas by Pemogan Village for spiritual places also clashes with the protection block in the area</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of Tahura Ngurah Rai. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Fourth</span><span class="font1">, the plan to develop the coastal area of the Sidakarya </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat </span><span class="font1">Village for “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Melasti</span><a href="#bookmark10"><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">”</span><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">is also in conflict with the area of Tahura Ngurah Rai, as well as several cases of coastal area development plans by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages in the areas of Sanur, Tuban, and Tanjung Benoa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the polemic problems abovementioned, of course, not all of them depart from the awareness to realize the government’s development goals that prioritize the protection of the universe and its contents, hence sectoral interests can damage the purpose of maintaining ecosystems that should be protected. The authority as specified in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> in managing water sources, spaces, and soils must be implemented properly so as not to cause ambiguity and conflict of norms regarding the management of the Forest Park area which is regulated by the Regulation of the Minister of Environment and Forestry in Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The issuance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> determine the authority of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village to manage water sector as stipulated in Article 25 paragraph (1) letters c and d of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">. The provision stipulates that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The local authority on the scale of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village as referred to in Article 23 includes the management of: … c. water sources; d. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pasisi</span><span class="font1"> (coastal area) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sagara </span><span class="font1">(sea)”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The existence of this authority in the coastal area sector is undeniable as a result of the existence of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village as a traditional organization in Bali which is the point of the implementation of development in the Province of Bali. In fact, to focus more on structuring Customary Government in Bali, the Provincial Government of Bali has established an agency in charge of customary governance issues, namely the Customary Community Empowerment Service (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dinas Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Adat</span><span class="font1"> also known as PMA). This indicates that there is a power or authority given to customary community through the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village as their institution to move forward to realize the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sad Kerthi Loka Bali</span><span class="font1"> program launched by the Bali Provincial Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the abovementioned, there are conflict of norms that occur as the effect of the implementation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">, especially in terms of the authority of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village in managing the coastal area that have forest park. This research will examine the scope of authority of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages in the management of coastal areas based on the Bali Province Regional Regulation No. 4 of 2019 concerning </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village and the management of the Forest Park in the Coastal area in the perspective of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ius constituendum</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The purpose of this research is examining the authority of of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages in the management of coastal areas based on the Bali Province Regional Regulation No. 4 of 2019 concerning </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village. the management of the Forest Park in the Coastal area in the perspective of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ius constituendum</span><span class="font1">. This research also aims to construct the regulation on forest park in coastal areas from the perspective of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ius constituendum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Previous study was conducted by Eka Krisna Yanti in 2019 concerning “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kewenangan Desa Adat Dalam Pengelolaan Kepariwisataan Budaya Bali Dalam Perspektif Peraturan Desa Adat</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nomor 4 Tahun 2019 tentang Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">”.</span><a href="#bookmark11"><span class="font1"> <sup>6</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">The study was focused on the authority of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat </span><span class="font1">Village in managing Balinese Cultural Tourism as the main attraction of Bali tourism and the dualism of village that applies in Bali. In 2019, Purnama and Dewa also conducted similar research concerning “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desa Adat Dallam Pengelolaan Tanah Adat Bali Berbasis Kebijakan Daerah</span><span class="font1">”</span><a href="#bookmark12"><span class="font1">.<sup>7</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">The reseach was focused on the clarity of the status of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat </span><span class="font1">Village as the subjects of land ownership rights which have implications for the authority of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> village in managing customary lands in Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the abovementioned, there is similarity between this research and the previous studies in terms of topic, which mainly discussed about the authority of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village, however the focus of study is different. This research is focusing its study on the authority of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village in managing coastal areas based on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> and construting a regulation concerning forest park in the perspective of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ius constituendum</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This research was normative legal research using several approaches, namely statutory approach and conceptual approach. According to Johnny Ibrahim, normative legal research is a scientific research procedure to find truth based on scientific logic from the normative side.</span><a href="#bookmark15"><span class="font1"> <sup>8</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">The normative side here is not limited to laws and regulations. According to Peter Mahmud, legal research is normative research, but not only positivist law research</span><a href="#bookmark16"><span class="font1">.<sup>9</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">Norms are not only interpreted as positive laws, namely rules made by politicians who have a higher position as stated by John Austin or rules made by authority as stated by Hans Kelsen. Based on this opinion, legal research seeks to find the truth of coherence, namely whether the rule of law is in accordance with legal norms and whether the legal norms containing obligations and sanctions are in accordance with legal principles whether one's actions are in accordance with legal norms or legal principles. Therefore, norms are also interpreted as behavioral guidelines.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The regulation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages in the form of Regional Regulations is certainly a form of appreciation and recognition carried out by a regional government for the existence of traditional organizations that require a legal basis and legality to be able to carry out their activities. Moreover, in Bali, the existence of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> villages cannot be separated from the life of the Balinese people who are very attached to these traditional customary units in carrying out their lives, especially in the fields of customs, religion, and culture which cannot be separated from the life of the Balinese people which have been passed down from generation to generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The development of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages from time to time can be said to have undergone a significant change. In the past, the existence of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages was strongly felt by Balinese customary community called “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Krama Adat</span><span class="font1">” in carrying out daily activities, mainly related to religious issues that carried the concept of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pura Khayangan Tiga</span><span class="font1"> in each </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat </span><span class="font1">Village, as well as the concept of “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bebanjaran</span><span class="font1">” that emerged as a community livelihood unit that used to be the majority are engaged in the agricultural sector</span><a href="#bookmark19"><span class="font1">.<sup>10</sup></span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village is known as a place for the community unit to work together to carry out their duties and rights which are outlined in a mutually agreed guideline both orally and in writing, most of which are in the form of traditional regulation named </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">awig</span><span class="font1">-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">awig</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">perarem</span><span class="font1">, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">elikita</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the life of independence, the existence of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village is side by side with the existence of the Administrative Village or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desa Dinas</span><span class="font1"> which is an extension of the Central Government which runs the current decentralized system. Hence, the position of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat </span><span class="font1">Villages and Administrative Villages in Bali are both carrying out their respective functions which are still running until nowadays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to the Bali Province Regional Regulation No. 3 of 2001 concerning </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desa Pakraman</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> is defined as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“a unit of customary law community in the Province of Bali which has a unified tradition and manners of social life of the Hindu community from generation to generation in the ties of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kahyangan Tiga</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kahyangan Desa</span><span class="font1"> which has a certain area and its own assets and has the right to take care of its own household.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Further, according to Article 1 point 1 of Law No. 6 of 2014 concerning Village, it is regulated that there are two types of villages, which states that a village is a village and a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> village or another name, hereinafter referred to as a village, is a legal community unit that has territorial boundaries that are authorized to regulate and manage government affairs, the interests of the local community based on community initiatives, origin rights, and/or traditional rights that are recognized and respected in the government system of the the Republic of Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The difference between “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> village” and “Administrative village”, can be seen from the elements of “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> village” which include: its management structure, and its governance</span><a href="#bookmark20"><span class="font1">.<sup>11</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">The elements consist of: (1) </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Parahyangan</span><span class="font1"> elements is a Hindu holy place called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> village temple; (2) elements of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pawongan</span><span class="font1">, people who are Hindus, called “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">krama desa adat</span><span class="font1">”; (3) </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Palemahan</span><span class="font1"> elements is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> village areas managed according to Hinduism</span><a href="#bookmark21"><span class="font1">.<sup>12</sup></span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> village leadership apparatus, known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">prajuru</span><span class="font1">, consists of the chairman (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bendesa</span><span class="font1">), vice chairman (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">petajuh</span><span class="font1">), treasurer (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">petengen</span><span class="font1">), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kesinoman</span><span class="font1"> (general assistant). </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> village is manages based on Hindu religious norms, Balinese customary law (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">awig-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">awig</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pararem</span><span class="font1">) and national law. In general, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> villages have main tasks and functions in preserving and implementing Hindu religious beliefs and upholding Balinese customary law to achieve inner and outer peace and prosperity. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> villages in Bali were previously referred to as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desa Pakraman</span><span class="font1"> based on the Bali Provincial Regulation Number 3 of 2001 which was later amended by Regional Regulation Number 3 of 2003 concerning </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desa Pakraman</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Administrative Village has a government structure led by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lurah</span><span class="font1"> or Village Head (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perbekel</span><span class="font1">). This village has various ranks of staffing staff assigned by the Regional Government in providing administrative services to the community related to population, licensing, social affairs, as well as as an extension of the State's hand in carrying out the mandate of the Constitution to fulfill State Goals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In fact, the dualism of government in Bali can be ended, if the Regional Government of Bali is willing to choose the form of Village Government which is expected to be implemented in Bali based on the mandate of Law Number 6 of 2014. However, based on input and a fairly long debate, with various considerations, Bali finally chose to maintain the dualism of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village and Administrative village until now, bear in mind that both run well so far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The existence of this Governmental Dualism, of course, in some ways can lead to a reduction in the meaning of one form of the Village, so that it is well realized that gradually it can drown out the existence of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages, whose role in authority has been eroded by government. Moreover, in the era of uncontrolled population migration, the role and function of Administrative village in regulating population is more dominant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In order to strengthen the existence of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages in Bali so that their existence does not overlap with the Administrative Village, it is necessary to take steps to strengthen, as well as protect, so that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages can have authority and continue to exist in protecting Bali from the onslaught of various understandings, cultures, and traditions as well as community civilization, which of course not all can be in line with the existence of customary community’ lives in Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore, through the regulation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">, it is something that should be supported and of course provide legal guarantees for the implementation of a sovereign </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village Government to carry out its duties in realizing the peace, prosperity, happiness and peace of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According the provisions of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">, there are various authorities possessed by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages in carrying out their duties and functions.

<p><span class="font1">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local authority on the scale of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village as referred to in paragraph (1) is as long as it is the authority of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> village.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Taking into account at the authority of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village in the provisions of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">, it can be seen that the role of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village is vital and strategic. It is in accordance with the vision and mision of Bali Provincial Government in strengthening the elements of customary and local wisdom in supporting the program of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sat Kerthi Loka Bali</span><span class="font1">, which embrace the local wisdom in Bali as well as glorify it by providing guarantees and legal protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The authority of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village that examined through this research is related to the authority in managing water sources and coastar area and the sea (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pasisi</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sagara</span><span class="font1">) as stipulated in Article 25 paragraph (1) letters c and d. Although the authority of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat </span><span class="font1">Village is limited by the provisions of Article 25 paragraph (2) concerning the limitation of the authority of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village with the word “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pada hal yang sepanjang menjadi kewenangan desa adat</span><span class="font1">” (translated: on matters that as long as it is in the authority of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village). However, it is still vague and unclear historically and philosophically, because the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village existed before Indonesia’s independence. Therefore, the matters</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">related to the customary area become the basic authority of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village to regulate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to Article 25 paragraph (1) of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">, it has been stated that one of the authorities of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village is managing the coastal area or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pasisi</span><span class="font1">. In Bali, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pasisi</span><span class="font1"> is known as beach or coastal area that defined as the boundary area between land and the sea. The coastal area is mentioned as a transitional area between land and sea which is a meeting area between land and sea; towards the land covers the land part, either dry or submerged in water, which is still influenced by the characteristics of the sea such as tides, sea breezes, and infiltration of salt water; while towards the sea includes the part of the sea that is still influenced by natural processes that occur on land such as sedimentation and fresh water flow, as well as those caused by human activities on land such as deforestation and pollution</span><a href="#bookmark22"><span class="font1">.<sup>13</sup></span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Decree Number Kep.10/MEN/2002 on General Guidelines for the Planning of Integrated Coastal Management, Coastal Area is defined as a transitional area between interacting land and marine ecosystems, where towards the sea 12 miles from the coastline for the province and one third of the sea area (provincial authority) for the district/city and towards the land the administrative boundary of the district/city. The existence of this provision provides opportunities and avenues for the Provincial Government to regulate the existence of coastal areas, one of which is by giving the authority to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages through Regional Regulations. This is what the Bali Provincial Government has done with the issuance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> village authority in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The main idea of regulating the authority of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> is to provide legitimacy for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages in carrying out and enforcing the vision and mission of “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nangun Sat Kerthi Loka Bali”</span><span class="font1"> in maintaining the dignity and sovereignty of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages. With this authority arrangement, then the Customary Village through territorial customary law which is owned in the form of Awig-awig and Perarem then regulates, describes and reduces this authority, so that there are strengths and bases used by Traditional Villages in carrying out their duties and functions in the community. The granting of this authority in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> according to the Board of the Bali Province </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village Council Mr. Gede Arya Sena, stated that it was necessary to strengthen the existence of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages, one of which was to regulate their authority in Regional Regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This strengthening will cause </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages to carry out various legal strategic steps to maintain regional and community sovereignty hence, they are able to move autonomously with good coordination, of course, with the Regional Government through the extension of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village Council, in order to develop Bali as a whole through the power of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages. With this arrangement, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village can act in a directed manner and have a clear scope of authority, therefore no action or authority is exercised in a discretionary manner and causes problems in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Before the issuance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages was known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desa Pakraman</span><span class="font1">. It was stipulated under the provision of Article 6 of Bali Provincial Regional Regulation No. 3 of 2001 concerning </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desa Pakraman</span><span class="font1">:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desa Pakraman</span><span class="font1"> has the following authorities:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;settle traditional and religious disputes within their territory while still fostering harmony and tolerance between village manners in accordance with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig </span><span class="font1">and local customs;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participate in determining every decision in the implementation of development in its territory, especially those related to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Hita Karana</span><span class="font1">;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carry out legal actions inside and outside the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desa Pakraman”</span><span class="font1">.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Seeing this provision, the authority of the traditional village called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desa Pakraman</span><span class="font1"> at that time was limited to the function of mediator and executor in the context of resolving customary and religious disputes as well as implementing development in the field of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Hita Karana</span><span class="font1"> which was not described in detail. This is what is considered not to give authority by village officers who carry out their duties and functions in a society whose needs and interests are getting complex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is also expressed by Mr. Dudik Mahendra, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prajuru</span><span class="font1"> of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village of Sesetan who stated that in the era of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desa Pakraman</span><span class="font1">, the function and the autorities of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village tended to only be fixated on a series of traditional and religious ceremonies, making it difficult to develop and having to synergize with Administrative Village to carry out programs and breakthroughs due to the lack of funds owned and obtained from the Regional Government. However, with the issuance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">, the authority given to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village getting more vital and strategic, hence it can be considered as a real step in strengthening </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village. Therefore, the elaboration of the authority of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat </span><span class="font1">Village in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> is considered as a policy that meets the needs and expectations of the Balinese people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is certainly in accordance with the Policy-Oriented Framework of Inquiry by Myers S. McDougal and Harold D. Lasswell. McDougal stated that there are legal problems that arise due to the neglect of community expectations by legislators in the legislative process, which is often termed the context problem.</span><a href="#bookmark23"><span class="font1"> <sup>14</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">Community expectations are expectations generated by community processes in the form of reciprocal relationships between community components. The processes include all community processes at all levels: local, national, regional and global. The community process can take place at the will of the community, or the influence of the surrounding community pressure. Therefore, according to the Policy-Oriented Framework of Inquiry, legal problems that impact on problems in society should not occur and can be resolved with the sensitivity shown by policy makers to community responses, hence public expectations are represented through regulations or policies made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The issuance of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> implies the fulfillment of community expectations which in this case is the expectation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages to be able to have more power and authority in carrying out their functions. The authority of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village in the management of the Forest Park area that is included in the coastal area or water sources is regulated in the provisions of Article 25-point 1 letters c and d of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">, which gives authority to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village to manage the territory and water sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus, the Tahura Ngurah Rai area which is included in the area of coastal area and water sources is included in the area of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In relation to the management of the Tahura Ngurah Rai, it is understood that forest control as a form of earth, water and natural wealth is controlled by the state and used for the prosperity of the people. This control does not constitute ownership, but the state authorizes the government to regulate and manage everything related to forests, forest areas and forest products; determine forest area and/or change the status of forest area; regulate and stipulate legal relations between people and forests or forest areas and forest products, as well as regulate legal actions regarding forestry. The government has the authority to grant permits and rights to other parties to carry out activities in the forestry sector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to the Article 4 paragraph (2) of the Law No. 41 of 1999 concerning Forestry (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hereinafter</span><span class="font1"> Law on Forestry), it is stated that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Forest control by the state as intended in paragraph (1), shall grant the authority to the government to:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regulate and organize all aspects related to forest, forest area, and forest products;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stipulate the status of certain area as a forest area or a forest area as non-forest area; and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regulate and stipulate legal relations between man and forest, and to regulate legal actions concerning forestry”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">This provision emphasized the authority of government related to forest, forest area, as well as forest product. In accordance with the provision, the Article 1 point 14 clearly mentioned that “Government shall be the Central Government”, therefore the authority to regulate and organize all aspects related to forest belongs to the Central Government in this matter shall be assigned to the Ministry of Environment and Forestry in the form of attibution authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theoretically, the method of obtaining authority is influenced by the theory of authority which can be done in three ways, namely attribution, delegation, and mandate.</span><a href="#bookmark24"><span class="font1"> <sup>15</sup></span></a><span class="font1"><sup> </sup>Attribution is known as authority that is obtained directly from the law</span><a href="#bookmark25"><span class="font1">.<sup>16</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">Delegation is known as the transfer of authority to make a decision by a government official to another party</span><a href="#bookmark26"><span class="font1">.<sup>17</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">In this delegation of authority, there is a transfer of responsibility from the one who gave the delegation to the one who received the delegation. Furthermore, the mandate is the delegation of authority to subordinates, meaning that the responsibility remains with the giver of the mandate</span><a href="#bookmark27"><span class="font1">.<sup>18</sup></span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">Further, the Article 66 paragraph (1) of the Law on Forestry, it is stated that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“In the context of forest administration, Government shall delegate parts of authorities to Regional Government”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The purpose of the delegation of authorities shall be intended to improve the efficiency of forest administration in the context of regional autonomy development, as stipulated in Article 66 paragraph (2) of the Law on Forestry. The delegation of authorities in the context of forest administration shall includes the management of forest park, which shall be in accordance with the management plan that is arranged based on ecological aspects, technical, economic and socio-cultural aspects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on Article 1 point 10 of the Regulation of the Minister of Forestry Number: P. 10/Menhut-II/2009 concerning Guidelines for the Preparation of a Forest Park Management Plan, it states that: “Regional Technical Implementing Units are organizations carrying out technical tasks entrusted with managing Forest Parks under the and is responsible to the Provincial/Regency/City Office in charge of the forestry sector”. Further, the regulation concerning forest park is regulated under Government Regulation No. 28 of 2011 concerning Management of Nature Reserve Areas and Nature Conservation Areas (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hereinafter</span><span class="font1"> Government Regulation No. 28 of 2011), Article 1 number 10 states that a Forest Park is a nature conservation area for the purpose of collecting natural or non-natural plants and or animals, native and or non-native species, which used for public interest as research, scientific and educational purposes. Also as a facility that supports cultivation, culture, tourism and recreation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to Article 12 of Government Regulation No. 28 of 2011, it is regulated that the the implementation of Nature Reserve Areas (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hereinafter</span><span class="font1"> KSA) and Nature Conservation Areas (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hereinafter</span><span class="font1"> KPA) as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Regarding the existence of the Tahura Ngurah Rai in Bali, its implementation and management is carried out by the Tahura Ngurah Rai Technical Implementation Unit (UPT Tahura Ngurah Rai) based on the Governor of Bali Regulation No. 102 of 2011</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">concerning Technical Implementation Unit in the Bali Provincial Forestry Service. In terms of carrying out utilization activities in a forest area that has the status of a Forest Park Area, it is divided into several zones, which are restricted and determined by laws and regulations. Regarding the Tahura Ngurah Rai area, the existence of the criteria zone in it is based on the Decree of the Director General of Natural Resources and Ecosystem Conservation Number SK.255/KSDAE-SET/2015, dated November 6, 2015.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the abovementioned, there is a conflict of norm in the management of coastal areas in Bali. According to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">, it can be understood that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village has the authority to manage coastal area (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pasisi</span><span class="font1">) and water sources. However, according to Article 1 point 10 of the Regulation of the Minister of Forestry Number: P. 10/Menhut-II/2009 concerning Guidelines for the Preparation of a Forest Park Management Plan, it stated that the management of coastal area shall be assigned to Regional Technical Implementing Units under the Provincial/Regency/City Office in charge of the forestry sector. Regarding this matter, the management of the Tahura Ngurah Rai area was handed over to the UPTD Tahura Ngurah Rai which was formed and is under the Bali Provincial Forestry and Environment Service as the holder of autonomous forest management rights in Bali. Therefore, there shall be harmonization between these conflicted regulations to determine the management of coastal area.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">3.2 Regulation concerning Forest Park in Coastal Area in the Perspective of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ius Constituendum</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The issuance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> and the Law on Forest have caused a dualism in the management of Tahura Ngurah Rai in the coastal area of South Bali. According to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">, the authority to manage coastal area and air source is possessed by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat </span><span class="font1">Village, meanwhile according to the Law on Forest, the authority is possessed by the the Management Unit formed by the Regional Government that carried out by the UPTD of the Tahura Ngurah Rai. This condition has caused a polemic in the customary community whose area is included in the Tahura Ngurah Rai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village near Tahura Ngurah Rai think that they have the authority to manage Tahura Ngurah Rai, which according to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> belongs to the area of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village. This authority is used by several </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> villages to make the area of forest park as a source of income for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> villages from the tourism sector, hence some </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat </span><span class="font1">Villages try to build natural tourist attractions in the Tahura Ngurah Rai area, such as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village of Sesetan who uses the Tahura Ngurah Rai as a sea crossing and as a fishing recreation park, Sidakarya Village plans to make a beach tour on the east side, Pedungan Village has also built a place for boat docking and mooring, as well as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village of Tuban and its surroundings has built a boat mooring area in the Tahura Ngurah Rai area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some of the developments carried out by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village in the Tahura Ngurah Rai area were carried out solely by the approval of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village. According to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prajuru</span><span class="font1"> of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat </span><span class="font1">Village of Sesetan, namely I Wayan Dudik Mahendra, S. Sos, they had not received any approval from UPTD Tahura Ngurah Rai in carrying out the construction of a sea crossing in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village of Sesetan. The problem arose because the UPTD Tahura Ngurah Rai prohibits the use of the area by several </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village, which located within a protection zone or block. According to the Decree of the Director General of Natural Resources and Ecosystem Conservation Number SK.255/KSDAE-SET/2015, there are several critera within the Tahura Ngurah Rai, including a protection zone or block that cannot be used for economic purposes. It is different if the zone is included in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">utilization zone or block, then there is a possibility or potential to be developed as a tourist spot or natural business, but it still under the applicable terms and conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This condition has become an issue in the management of Tahura Ngurah Rai, since there are 2 (two) different regulations that authorize different authority in managing Tahura Ngurah Rai. Taking account at the legal provisions and the limitations that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat </span><span class="font1">Villages have in managing forest areas which are the authority of the central government attributable to local governments, then </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Villages must obey the principles and laws and control themselves in utilizing the area of Tahura Ngurah Rai which is assigned as the authority of UPT. Tahura Ngurah Rai to organize and manage it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In carrying out the provisions of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village is not allowed to take advantage arrogantly by using their authority and violating other regulation. Therefore, there shall be a guideline that can be carried out by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village in using their authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With regard to this matter, the Customary Community Empowerment Service (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dinas Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Adat</span><span class="font1"> also known as PMA) stated that the provisions regulated in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> must be composed in to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">perarem</span><span class="font1"> of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village in order to be implemented</span><a href="#bookmark28"><span class="font1">.<sup>19</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">perarem</span><span class="font1"> shall be composed in detail, hence it can be used as the guideliness for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village in managing their area, which includles managing water resources, coastal area, and the sea. In order to avoid conflict of norms, the content of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">perarem</span><span class="font1"> shall be in accordance with the prevailing law in Indonesia. Therefore, the draft of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">perarem</span><span class="font1"> should be discussed with the Customary Community Empowerment Service (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dinas Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Adat </span><span class="font1">also known as PMA) before the enactment. Once it is agreed, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">perarem </span><span class="font1">shall be used as the guidelines for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village in carrying the authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theoretically, this condition is related to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stufenbau des Recht</span><span class="font1"> theory (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hereinafter Stufenbau</span><span class="font1"> Theory) from Hans Kelsen</span><a href="#bookmark29"><span class="font1">.<sup>20</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">The problem related to conflict of norms can be solved by examining the hierarchy of law and regulation in Indonesia legal system. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stufenbau</span><span class="font1"> Theory emphasizes the conception of a hierarchical legal structure (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stufenbau</span><span class="font1">) and the primacy of the constitution</span><a href="#bookmark30"><span class="font1">.<sup>21</sup> </span></a><span class="font1">Based on this theory, it is stated that the legal norms are valid as long as it is sourced and based on higher legal norms, while in Indonesia, the legal ideals, the basis, and source of all legal norms is Pancasila</span><a href="#bookmark31"><span class="font1">.<sup>22</sup></span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stufenbau</span><span class="font1"> Theory, it is known that the hierarchical legal structure determine the degree of each arrangement of higher norms or lower norms. Therefore, in the event of conflict of norms, the higher norms shall prevails. It is in accordance with the derogatory principles, which expressed in Latin namely: “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex superior derogat legi inferiori</span><span class="font1">”, meaning that a higher law supersedes a lower one</span><a href="#bookmark32"><span class="font1">.<sup>23</sup></span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the abovementioned, it can be understood that there is a conflict of norm between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> and Law on Forest in the provisions related to the authority to manage the Tahura Ngurah Rai, which located in the coastal area and water resources of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village. According to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stufenbau</span><span class="font1"> Theory, which emphasizes the conception of a hierarchical legal structure, the provisions of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perda Desa Adat</span><span class="font1"> should be in accordance with higher norms related to the forestry.

This principle emphasized that in the event of conflict of norm, then a higher law supersedes a lower one. Therefore, there shall be a harmonization of law and regulation in managing the Tahura Ngurah Rai. The harmonization must be carried out by taking into accout the higher norms and other prevailing law to avoid multi-interpretation in carring out the authority to manage water sources, coastal area, and the sea by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prajuru</span><span class="font1"> of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adat</span><span class="font1"> Village.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Based on the abovementioned, it can be concluded that there is a conflict of norm in the management of coastal areas in Bali.
