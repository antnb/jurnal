<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The research was intended to describe the meaning for producing the study that was postulated approach of natural semantic. In term of, one form for one meaning and one meaning revealed in a lexicon. This study was qualitative research that the data was anaction verb in Balinese language, it was “ngalap”pick. There were some lexicon to express the meaning of “pick”, those were ngancuk, ngotek, ngilit related to the high place of an entity, related to the low place can be expressed by ngilut, ngempok, mikpik, ngangap, and each lexicons have their meaning in expression. It could be thoroughly analyzed by Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) theory. The unique findings shown by the instrument that used to do something, a juan was used to lexicons;ngancuk, ngotek, and ngilit, and hands was to do ngilut, ngempok, mikpik, ngangap. It meant, those lexicons used to express meaning in taking hold of something and move it. The entity was the high and low places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Keywords: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Balinese language, Ngalap, Metalanguage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Philosophically, NSM theory combines the philosophical and logical tradition in the study of meaning with typological approach to the study of language, and with broadly based empirical cross-linguistic investigation (Wierzbicka, 1996: 23). Based on morphological typology, Balinese language is categorized as agglutination because it has many affixes and particularly it consist of morphemes combination that was able to be separated each other. The other hands, it is to show incorporation typology characteristics. Due to have a unique meaning in a verb itself such as reflective and reciprocal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In phenomenal, commonly, Balinese language is one of native languages in Bali society. In order to see from national language politic, it is one of major local language in Indonesia because the native speaker more than one million and has a writing tradition. It is not only as a major, however also has a unique itself. The unique is to reflect Bali society existence that known of social stratification system. Linguistics is the study of the human ability to produce and interpret language in speaking, writing and signing (for the deaf). All languages and all varieties of every language constitute potential data for linguistic research, as do relationship between them and the relations and structures of their components (Allan, 2016: 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Empirically, every language comes with a lexicon-loosely equivalent to the vocabulary of that language (Allan, 2016: 3). A verb is one of lexicon prime categories in language (Givon, 1984: 51). Thus, a verb can be as entity from</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">events therefore, verb category is motivated semantically by events. As an events, it is to implicate a change that happens in time of context.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">NSM theory is as semantic analysis approach that is relatively modern and is able to give meaning analysis result that adequate (Sudipa, 2015: 272). In term of this caused technically of explication, the result of meaning analysis toward a language has approached semantic studies postulate that stated one form for one meaning and one meaning for one form. However, a lexicon is able to express one meaning or one meaning is expressed by a lexicon. It will avoid misunderstanding to ambiguity meaning of a lexicon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">II MATERIALS AND METHOD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2.1</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The materials of this article were taken from the data dealing with Balinese action verb implies the meaningof ngalap. The data was provided by giving some sample in sentence that taken from Satua Bali. As well, it was explained more by picture that researcher taken directly in the park.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2.2</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Technique of Collecting Data</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The data was collected from oral and written text sources, as well as, taking some photos directly. The oral one was collected by direct participation when the fruit season happened, the technique of observation and note-taking was applied in this study. Next, the written text was taken from Satua Baliin order to show the meaning in context.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2.3</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Technique of Analyzing Data</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The collected data was further analyzed by metalanguage approach. The language which a linguist uses to describe and analyzed the object is called the metalanguage.It follows the linguist study language as an expression of and vehicle for social interaction (Allan, 2016: 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A metalanguage is merely another language, often an artificial and not a natural one. One important practical constrain on a metalanguage is that mostly it needs to be understood by human being who normally communicate in a natural language of which they have fluent command. The basic requirement for metalanguage is to satisfaction communicate the meaning from: entity, process, result, instruments, and emotional state (Wierzbicka, 1996: 112). The meaning of ngalap in Balinese underwent the metalanguage analysis, especially, verb: ngalap in order to reveal the implying meaning cultural-value in such both verbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Givon (1984) divides verbs into three broad classifications namely; state verb, process verb, and action verb. The action verb, particularly, comes from act by someone or something in which pick included. The mapping of this verb is done by explication of English sematic primitives. The action predicate (D0) opens, universally, an agent slot. The possibility of yet another valency option for do, namely, an instrument options do with; someone did something with something. Do has two alternative pattern, A and B; (A) X did something (B) X</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">did something to Y, the element Happen, too, has alternative patterns C and D; (C) something happened to X (D) something happened in place P (Wierzbicka, 1996: 123).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Balinese language of a verb ngalap (pick) reflected corpus transitive verb prototype in this analysis. This choice is intended able to give describing of semantic structure briefly without spin meaning. The lexicon ngalapwithin their variations able to describe semantic structure by sub-component “X did something”, “something happened (bad)” and “X did something”, “something happened (good)”. It is to represent the meaning concept do and happen. Furthermore, in relation to conducting a study of meaning from semantic perspective, Goddard (1997:16-17) affirms that there is an agreement that semantic analysis should give an illuminating account of meaning relation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">III RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/21155-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:176pt;height:135pt;">
<p><span class="font4">The action verb ngalap; the people ngalap (pick) in Balinese language, commonly has component mapping “X did something to Y” and because of this “something happened to Y”. The unique of each lexicon in ngalap variations based on a tool, action model, a part of entity that moved or released, and the final result wants to achieve or agent hopes. The semantic feature mapping is described through paraphrase and descriptive analysis in simple sentences and natural. To see the each meaning of lexicon will be described and explained as follows;</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The entity of this lexicon is referring to the high place. The people who wants ngancukpoh ‘pick a mango” needs a tool like juan ‘punting pole/a long wood more than three meters and usually made of from bamboo’ by a straight vertical action from down to up to Y.The action is usually done many times until the mango released from its stalk. The mapping of component “X did something to Y” the way of picking is vertical and the result is the fruit moved from up to down and getting hurt in below, “Y become hurt and fall”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This action can be explicated as follows;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At that time, X did something to Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of this, at the same time, something happened to Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">X did this something (up and down vertically)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The lexicon ngotek refers to entity at the high places. The people who wants to pick a rose apple needs a tool to get it. That tool is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">juan</span><span class="font4">. The way of picking the fruits by a straight horizontally action from side to Y, this action needs a certain way in accordance with the agent hopes to get something from up. The action verb ngotek usually done one/many times up to the entity move from its places. The agent did something to the entity “X did something to Y”, “X ngotek something to Y”. The way of picking is horizontal and the result is that something getting hurt in side and falling down to the ground. “Y becomes hurt and falling down”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The explication can be described as follows;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At that time, X did something to Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of this, at the same time, something happened to Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">X did this something (horizontally to side)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The action ngilit is used to take hold something and move it. The people who wants picking a fruit that has a long stalk, for example; rambutan or ceroring. it should be picked by a certain tool, it is namely juan that in the top has the form like a tongs. The way of picking is to rotate to the left or right by making likes a slingshot to the top of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">juan</span><span class="font4">. The action verb ngilit usually done one time in one way, rotate to the right or rotate to the left, the entity is taking place in the high place. The agent did something to the entity “X did something to Y”, “X ngilit something to Y”. The way of picking is rotated and the result is that something well and that fruit is good because it attaches at the top of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">juan</span><span class="font4">. “Y becomes move from up”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The explication can be described as follows;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At that time, X did something to Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of this, at the same time, something happened to Y</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The prominent feature of this action particularly the tool that use to pick something. To the high places, the tool that used is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">juan</span><span class="font4">, next the low places is done without instruments, however merely by hand. The actions of picking in Balinese related to the low place are expressed by ngilut, ngempok, mikpik, and ngangap. The descriptions action of those lexicon are as follows;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<p><span class="font4">Ngilut is a way of picking the fruitsat the low places toward our body. The action verb ngilut usually done in one time, rotate to the right or the left, by holding and rotate it until move from its stalk. The agent did something to the entity “X did something to Y”, “X ngilut something to Y”, “Y becomes released and move from the stem”, the lexicon action in sentence;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This verb can be explicated as follows;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At that time, X did something to Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of this, at the same time, something happened to Y</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Ngémpok is a way of picking a fruits, the way of releasing from its place is by fracturing the fruit stalk. This action verb usually done in one time. The agent does something that makes the entity released whole or a part of fruit.It is very seldom the lexicon ngempok is used by human being, because it has a bad value in our life. On other words, it relevant denoted to the animals. The example of a lexicon ngemok is able to show as bellows;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This verb can be explicated as follows;</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Mikpik is a way of picking a leaf or the fruit that is a small, has many seed in one stalk, e.g. the bila leaf, clove, coffee, etc. it does not use any tool, however directly by hands. To pick the entity by released the top of leaf or seeds. This action verb usually done repeatedly. The agent does something that makes the entity released merely the seeds of the top or leaf only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This verb can be explicated as follows;</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Ngangap is an action verb that especially used to pick a rice. The people who wants to pick a rice has to use a certain tool, it is namely anggapan (it is made by wood and knife). The tool is grip than the rice is pull, therefore it is released from its stalk. It means the sharp of knife is able to cut the rice. This action verbs is a very difficult to find recently. Ngangap usually used for rice that harvest a year in time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The explication can be described as follows;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At that time, X did something to Y</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IV CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the analysis using the NSM theory, it is to show that the action verb in Balinese of ngalap can be expressed by ngancuk, ngoték, ngilit related to the high place of an entity, related to the low place can be expressed by ngilut, ngempok, mikpik, ngangap. The technique of analyzing the data by paraphrase/explication, the metalanguage approaches through the mapping manage to analyze the meaning of ngalap is able to identify the semantic primes that combined in polysemy, therefore, the action verb of picking ‘ngalap’ which has complexity semantic feature is successful to be discussed completely. It is reflected to the meaning that is contained of each lexicon to be revealed and distinguished, though, it still implies the same meaning. The result is supported the postulate meaning that stated one form for one meaning and one meaning for one form.</span></p>
