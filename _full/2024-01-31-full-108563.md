In the case of Rubisco Like Protein RLP Chromohalobacter salexigen BKL 5 RLP CS which is halophilic the presence of salt bridges SB is not too numerous but efficient enough to maintain stability in high salt stress This study was to determine the effect of mutations SB at position 185 D185WT on the stability and activity of RLP CS through an insilico approach by replacing aspartic acid with glutamic acid and alanine D185E and D185A The methods used
