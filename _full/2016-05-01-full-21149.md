<p><span class="font3">Lexicon ‘See’ as an English verb that means ‘perceive with the eyes’has different form of lexicon and different semantics meaning in Kupang Malay Language (KML). The lexicons that refer to ‘see’ are ‘lia’,‘loti’,‘malerok’, ‘maloi’ and‘pe’emata’. Those five lexicons have their own meaning. In order to understand those words deeply, such matters were analysed by a study using Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) theory.By applying descriptive qualitative method and paraphrase/ explication technique, the slightly different semantic features of ‘lia’,‘loti’,‘malerok’, ‘maloi’ and‘pe’emata’ can be comprehensively revealed.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>I INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">To say a language is to say a society since there is no society without language. Many facts show that language serves an important role in a society. Therefore, when one understands a language, it can be said that s/he might also understand the society. There are many aspects need to be understood in any language. One of them is understanding meaning of lexicon(s).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Understanding a lexicon in any language deeply is very important. By knowing semantic meaning, one can use the lexicon properly so s/he can act correctly in the society where the language is spoken.Here, the researcher would like to investigateKupang Malay Language so this language might be understood deeper, both by the writer and reader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Kupang Malay Language (next, it is called KML) is a local language in East Nusa Tenggara Province. East Nusa Tenggara is a province in Indonesia. This province is located nearby Timor Leste Country. Following is a language map that shows the use of KML in East Nusa Tenggara Province.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/21149-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:338pt;height:246pt;">

<p><span class="font4">KML is spoken as a united language for people in East Nusa Tenggara. It is used as the first language or the second language in East Nusa Tenggara Province. Scientifically, this language is a creole language (Jacob andGrimes, 2003: 2).There is onlylittle literature that writeabout this language. Therefore, this research is hoped to be worthwhile to the development of the linguistics studies and for those who want to have information for further research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Next, this research focuses its data on the lexicon ‘See’ that means to perceive with eyes. In KML, there are five different terms or lexicons to state ‘see’. Those lexicons are‘lia’,‘loti’,‘malerok’, ‘maloi’ and‘pe’emata’.Each of those lexicons has different usage and different semantic meaning. When one uses a lexicon incorrectly in communication, s/he will, of course, get trouble in Kupang society since wrong usage will create a gap of communication. Bearing the matters stated above, the researcher is interested to conduct a study under a title: ‘See’ in Kupang Malay Language: A Metalanguage Study.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>II MATERIALS AND METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Data was gained by taking the lexicon(s) from dictionary of Kupang Malay language. First, from the Kupang Malay – Indonesian dictionary, the researcher looked up all lexicons that means ‘melihat’ (Indonesian lexicon that means ‘See’). After getting those lexicons needed, the researcher started to explore meaning of them.The researcher also used exploratory method and introspection method to collect data.The research design used by the researcher</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in this study was descriptive qualitative method. This method is appropriate as qualitative method tends to collect data naturally (Creswell. 2009:175).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Theory used in this research was Natural Semantics Metalanguage (Next, will be called NSM). NSM was first introduced by Wierzbicka (1996) and the follower like Goddard (1996). This theory aims to explore meaningof word(s). Meaning that is explored by this theory covers lexical meaning, illocutionary meaning and grammatical meaning.Sudipa (2013), refers to Wierzbika (1996), states that NSM combines philosophical and logical tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘…..according to Weirzbicka (1996:23), Natural Semantics Metalanguage theory combines the philosophical and logical tradition in the study of meaning with a typological approach to the study of language, and with broadly based empirical cross-linguistic investigations’(Sudipa, 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Philosophical and logical tradition is important in linguistics, especially in semantics. The tradition can express or actualize what is meant by human mind through language (Koroh, 2015).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Goddarfd (2010) gives example of applying this theory using causative verb ‘killed’ and ‘broke’ in English.Causative verb ‘killed’ and ‘broke’, in general linguistic are frequently analyzed as cause to die (or cause to become not alive) and cause to become broken, respectively. But, NSM explications are given below. Aside from the fact that NSM system recognizes because rather (than cause) as its basic exponent in the causal domain, it can be seen that the explications give a more articulated and nuanced account of the event structure. In both cases, the explications depict an action by the agent X with an immediate effect on the patient Y. In thecase of kill, namely, something happening to the person Y’s body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Someone X killed someone Y:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Someone X did something to someone else Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of this, something happened to Y at the same time</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of this, something happened to Y’s body</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of this, after this Y was not living anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For break, namely, X do something to Y as patient, therefore something happening to the thing Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Someone X broke something Y:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Someone X did something to something Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of this, something happened to Y at the same time</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It happened in one moment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of this, after this Y was not one thing anymore</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">People can think about it like this: ‘it cannot be one thing anymore’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Gaddard. 2010)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In simple words, NSM helps the researcher to describe lexicon(s) using language. This breaks concepts/ lexicons of KML down into combinations of simple concept/ words using small connection of semantic primes (Sudipa. 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Next, Technique applied in presenting data was paraphrase/ explication.This was applied by following some rules, as follows: First, paraphrase must combine some meanings since a form cannot be explained only by one meaning. Second, paraphrase can also be done by using a uniqueness of a language. Third, paraphrasing a sentence must follow syntactical rules. Fourth, paraphrase always use simple sentence. The last, sentence of paraphrase sometimes need special identity and space (Sudipa. 2004).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>III RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The result of this research and analysis are presented based upon those five KML lexicons that refer to ‘see’ in English. As found in KML dictionary, there are ‘lia’,‘loti’,‘malerok’, ‘maloi’ and‘pe’emata’.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">‘Lia’ has similar meaning to ‘see’. As ‘see’ can be described ‘perceive with the eyes’(</span><a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/see"><span class="font4">http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/see</span></a><span class="font4">), ‘lia’, as have mentioned before, can be described‘perceive with the eyes’. Some examples of how ‘lia’ is used in KML are as follows.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>IV CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Based on data analyzed above, the researcher makes some conclusions. First, There are five different lexicons that describes ‘see’in KMLthat means perceiving with eyes. Those five lexicons are ‘lia’,‘loti’,‘malerok’, ‘maloi’ and‘pe’emata’.Each of them has their own semantic meaning. The semantic meaning can be studied deeply using theory of NSM.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Next, NSM study describes those KML lexicons as follows: ‘Lia’is a natural activity of seeing. ‘Loti’ means someone sees someone other or something seriously. ‘Malerok’ means someone sees someone other or something at glance from the left or right side of himself/ herself. ‘Maloi’ means someone sees someone other or something in secret. ‘Pe’emata’ means someone sees someone other or something because she/he is angry at someone/something that she/he sees.</span></p>
