Intercalation of Bentonit clay with quaternary ammonium salt Ncetyl NNN trimethyl ammoniumbromide in the presence of palmitic acid was investigated in this research The aim was to improve the capacity ofBentonit clay as adsorbent for lead ion Pb2 The salt used has a capacity of 8 mmol10kg clay which equal to itscapacity as cation exchanged After intercalating process palmitic acid was added and then clay was ready to beused as adsorbent for lead ion
