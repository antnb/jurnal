Macrozoobenthos are invertebrate animals that live on the bottom of the waters which are often used as an estimator of the imbalance in the physical chemical and biological environment of the waters Polluted waters will affect the survival of macrozoobenthos organisms because they are easily affected by the presence of physical and chemical pollutants This study aims to determine the diversity abundance of macrozoobenthos as well as diversity index evenness i
