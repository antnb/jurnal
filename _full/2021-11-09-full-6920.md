<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">A sentence is a grammatical unit consisting of one or more words. Words express an idea, a question, subject and statements and usually contain a subject and a verb. Many sentences build sentences which are united as one. Phrases and sentences are built up of constituent series (syntactic units), which serve as grammatical function. An adverb is a word that changes the meaning of a verb, adjective, and sentence. Adverbs are words like hurriedly, quickly, slowly, and instantly. It modifies a verb or verb phrase. An adverb provides information about the manner, time, place, frequency, or certainty. Brown and Miller (1992:95) describes that adverbial of manner indicate the manner in which the event is described by the verb. Adverbial of manner shows how an action is performed. There are some variations of its form. Adverbial of manner can be formed in the form of adverb phrase and prepositional phrase. Analyzing sentence into its constituents is usually done in English. Using the constituent structure presentation, the adverbial of manner can also be analyzed. The sentence structure could be known as syntactical identification by identifying and analyzing the constituent.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In this writing, the research method consists of data source, method and technique of collecting data (how to collect the data), and method and technique of analyzing data (how to analyze the data collected). The data sources and method and technique of collecting data are the procedures used to find out certain objects.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Source</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The data were taken from the novel “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Knife of Dreams”</span><span class="font1"> by Robert Jordan. This novel was chosen as the data source because it contains a lot of adverbial of manner words which relate to the topic of this writing. Besides, there are many kinds of forms of adverbial of manner which can be found in this novel.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Collecting Data</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The technique of collecting data was done through library research. The method and technique of collecting data was conducted by documentation method. The data were taken from the novel with the documentation method in order to get some adverbial of manner words. There are two steps in collecting</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">data. First, it is important to get words of adverbial of manner by reading novel repeatedly.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Analyzing data</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Qualitative method is used in analyzing data. It was important to analyze the collected data descriptively based on the theoretical framework. First, the data were classified and analyzed, based on the forms of adverbial of manner. Based on the theory proposed by Brown and Miller (1991), the form of adverbial of manner was analyzed. It would be classified into the form of adverbial of manner (adverbial of manner which can be filled in the form of adverb of manner and adverbial of manner in the form of prepositional phrase). The form of adverbial of manner was presented using this tree diagram presentation.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In a sentence, adverbial of manner can be filled in the form of adverb of manner and prepositional phrase. According to Brown and Miller (1991:95) that adverbial of manner is the item that most readily spring to mind as examples of the adverb class, especially those formed by the affixation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">–ly</span><span class="font1"> to a corresponding adjective form. According to Brown and Miller (1992:95) adverbials of manner are the items that most readily spring to mind as examples of the class adverb, especially those formed by the affixation of –ly to a corresponding adjective form:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy ----------------&gt; happily (Brown and Miller, 1991:95)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicious -----------------k viciously (Brown and Miller, 1991:95)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Adverbials also take the form of prepositional phrase. The form of adverbial of manner in the prepositional phrase is characterized by the preposition as the head of adverbials of manner. According to Brown and Miller (1992:94) adverbials of manner are typically a prepositional phrase:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man beat the dog </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in a vicious manner</span><span class="font1"> (Brown and Miller, 1991:94)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man beat the dog </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">with apparent enjoyment</span><span class="font1"> (Brown and Miller, 1991:94)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">According to Brown and Miller (1991:97) adverbs are modifier and that to some extent the scope of the modification can be caught in constituent structure representations. This can be captured in constituent structure diagrams of the kind shown, which also illustrates the fact that the same category, PP, can occur in variety of functions-as the strict subcategory of a verb, as a VP adverb and as a sentence adverbial.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/6920-1.png" alt="" style="width:322pt;height:146pt;">

<p><span class="font1">Subcategorizer of manner</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a sentence, the form of adverbial of manner is presented into the constituent structure representation. This chapter will discuss about the form of adverbial of manner in a sentence and the constituent structure analysis of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second theory proposed by Quirk and Greenbaum (208:1973) describes about the position of adverbial of manner. Those are: initial position, medial position, and final position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Adverbial of manner can be in the form of adverb of manner which occurs in the initial, medial, and final position. Some data below show the adverbial of manner that can be filled in the form of adverb of manner which occurs in the initial, medial and final position.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial Position</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Adverbial of manner can be in the form of adverb of manner in the initial position, those are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1.</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hastily</span><span class="font1"> she released the source (Jordan, 2005:505)</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/6920-2.png" alt="" style="width:245pt;height:178pt;"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hastily</span><span class="font1"> She released the source</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Form</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The adverbial of manner in the constituent structure above can be filled in the form of adverb of manner. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hastily</span><span class="font1"> is the adverb of manner which fills the position of adverbial of manner. This adverb comes before the subject which is used to put emphasis on how </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">she released the source. Hastily</span><span class="font1"> is an adverb of manner which is derived from an adjective </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">haste</span><span class="font1"> and added with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">–ly</span><span class="font1"> suffix. In the process of the suffixation, adverb of manner is formed by: haste + (-ly) suffix. Therefore, it becomes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">hastily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It can be explained from the constituent structure above that a sentence has two major constituents. They are ADVP and S. It can be seen that the constituent structure of sentence </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">She release the source</span><span class="font1"> is divided into the NP and VP. The NP </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">she</span><span class="font1"> and VP </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">released the source</span><span class="font1"> are parts of the constituent structure above. An adverb of manner </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hastily</span><span class="font1"> consists of a single word. It is optional because the sentence is well formed although it occurs without the presence of adverb </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hastily.</span><span class="font1"> It also functions as modifiers to the nucleus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">she released the source.</span><span class="font1"> It is the sister of the nuclear sentence </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">She released the source.</span><span class="font1"> The NP </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">She </span><span class="font1">is followed by the VP </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">released</span><span class="font1"> and the NP </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the source</span><span class="font1">. The NP </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the source</span><span class="font1"> is divided into two constituents. They are article </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font1"> and noun </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">source</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Position</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">An adverb of manner that fills the position of adverbial of manner in the constituent structure above is placed in the initial position (I). It is placed before the subject </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">She</span><span class="font1"> of the sentence.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">2.</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurriedly</span><span class="font1"> Rand searched for the targets (Jordan, 2005:445)</span></p></li></ul><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/6920-3.png" alt="" style="width:263pt;height:244pt;">
<p><span class="font1">a. Form</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hurriedly</span><span class="font1"> is an adverb of manner that comes before the subject. This adverb is used to explain about in what way </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">he searched for the targets. Hurriedly </span><span class="font1">is an adverb of manner which is derived from an adjective </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hurried</span><span class="font1"> and added with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">–ly</span><span class="font1"> suffix. In the process of the suffixation, adverb of manner is formed by: hurried + (-ly) suffix becoming </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hurriedly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The constituent structure indicates that a sentence has two major constituents, those are ADVP and S. The ADVP consists of one constituent in the form of ADV </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hurriedly</span><span class="font1">. It is optional because the sentence is well formed without the presence of adverb </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hurriedly.</span><span class="font1"> It also functions as modifiers to the nucleus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rand searched for the targets.</span><span class="font1"> It can be concluded from the constituent structure above that the constituent structure of sentence </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rand searched for the targets</span><span class="font1"> is divided into the NP and VP. The NP </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rand</span><span class="font1"> and VP </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">searched for the targets</span><span class="font1"> are</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">part of the constituent structure above. The NP </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rand</span><span class="font1"> is followed by the VP </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">searched</span><span class="font1"> and the NP </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the targets</span><span class="font1">. The NP </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the targets</span><span class="font1"> is divided into two constituents.

<p><span class="font1">b. Position</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hurriedly</span><span class="font1"> is an adverb of manner which occurs in the initial of the sentence. It is called the initial of the sentence because it is placed before the subject </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rand</span><span class="font1"> of the sentence. Therefore an adverb of manner </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hurriedly</span><span class="font1"> in the constituent structure above is called in the initial of the sentence.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the previous discussion and analysis, there are some points which can be drawn as conclusion. There are two forms of adverbial of manner. Those are adverbial of manner which can be filled in the form of adverb of manner and prepositional phrase. Adverbial of manner can be formed by adding – ly to the corresponding adjectives. The suffix </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">–ly</span><span class="font1"> is added to the positive form of the adjective. The addition of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">–ly</span><span class="font1"> to the adjectives </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kind</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">simple</span><span class="font1"> produces the adverbs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kind-ly</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">simp-ly</span><span class="font1">. As a rule, it is possible to derive an adverb by adding the suffix </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">–ly</span><span class="font1"> to an adjectival base.</span></p>
