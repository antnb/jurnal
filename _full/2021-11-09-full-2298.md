Central AC type water chiller is a refrigeration machine that release heat to environment Heat energy that released to environment comes from room heat load that absorbed by machine and heat from compressor The best form in using this loss energy is heat recovery water heater technology where this machine will take heat from condenser by a heat exchanger to heating water Refrigerant will flow in the heat exchanger before entering condenser after that refrigera
