<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">This study entitled Mapping Grammatical Relations of English Verbs, concerned on numbers of arguments that a verb could assign and how an argument is syntactically motivated in clauses of which the mood is declarative. This study is a library research study. The method of analysis that was applied in this study was descriptive method which describes linguistics phenomena like what it actually is. The data of this study were taken from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) by inputting verbs those have been determined to the website </span><a href="http://www.english-corpora.org/coca/"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">http://www.english-corpora.org/coca/</span></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">. The verbs eat, write, and give are the determined verbs which belong to intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs in sequence. The main theory applied in this study was Kroeger’s (2005) regarding to transitivity and grammatical relation. Based on the analysis, verbs in English require argument(s), terms or obliques. An intransitive verb assigns a term that stands as subject, a transitive verb assigns two terms those stand as subject and primary object. On the other hand, a ditransitive verb assigns three terms those stand as subject, primary object and secondary object. In addition, there is an argument that stands as oblique.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Language as a mean of communication requires a complete thought to express. Its properties can be divided into some level, starting from phoneme into meaningful sentence. A meaningful sentence in English at least consists of a clause to establish. In other word, a sentence must possess at least a subject and a verb or predicate in order to express a complete thought. For instance in this sentence, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">John slept</span><span class="font3">, it involves a proper noun as subject or participant who does the process of slept. Kroeger (2005: 53) therefore defined that the individuals (or participants) of whom the property or relationship is claimed to be true are called arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The arguments that accompany the predicate have different semantic functions, or roles, in the proposition. In accordance with it, Kreidler (2002: 66) defined that what roles they (arguments) have depends partly on the nature of the predicate and partly on their own meanings. Regarding to the role of argument, Kroeger (2005: 53) stated that the element of meaning which identifies the property or relationship is called the predicate. Different predicate may require different number of arguments. This sentence, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mary slapped John</span><span class="font3">, involves predicate </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">slapped</span><span class="font3">. It requires one who slapped and one who is slapped; in other word, it requires two arguments. Different from sentence, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">John slept</span><span class="font3">, its predicate only</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">requires one participant or argument, one who slept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Regarding to semantic role of argument, people might find it confusing to distinguish a grammatical relation of an argument. These examples will provide descriptions of how grammatical relation is determined by grammatical properties not by its semantic or meaning.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dog bit John.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John was bitten by a dog.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">There are still those who define a subject as the doer of an action, while the object is the person or thing affected by the doer. However, both examples have shown that a subject is not always an agent, and an object is not always a patient. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A dog</span><span class="font3"> in (a) is the subject of the sentence and also the agent or one who initiates to do the action of biting; in contrast, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a dog</span><span class="font3"> in (b) is not the subject of the sentence, it is considered as object of the preposition or oblique argument although the role it plays is still the same. Miller (2002: &nbsp;105) stated that there are</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">assumptions that consider term like a dog in (b) as logical subject since it denotes agent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although a grammatical sentence might not have meaningful sense and a meaningful sentence might be ungrammatical, the semantic role of an argument does not determine the grammatical relation of a sentence. The grammatical relation must deal with the grammatical properties, while what argument(s) is assigned is semantically bounded by a certain predicate. People might recognize </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a dog</span><span class="font3"> is subject in both </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a dog bit John</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">John was bitten by a dog</span><span class="font3"> for the reason that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a dog</span><span class="font3"> in both sentences stands for the role of agent, one who or which initiates the action. This study tried to examine how arguments were structured with grammatical relations.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>METHOD AND THEORY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The method that was applied in this study was descriptive method. According to Zaim (2014: 22), this method describes</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">linguistics phenomena like what it actually is. The data of this study were taken from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The method applied in collecting the data was documentary method by reading</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">through the source and finding clauses of which the mood are declarative. In this study the data were collected by using a website tool, </span><a href="http://www.english-corpora.org/coca/"><span class="font3">http://www.english-corpora.org/coca/</span></a><span class="font3">. The steps of data collection were divided as follows; inputting keywords regarding to the construction of the sentence having notion of verb valence. The verbs were taken from data found in Kroeger (2004) Based on that, the data were be classified based on its valence and transitivity. The verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">eat</span><span class="font3"> belong to intransitive verb, while the verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">write</span><span class="font3"> is involved to transitive verb. On the other hand, the verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">give</span><span class="font3"> is involved to ditransitive verbs. After inputting a key word in this case those verbs, they were listed in different sentences, and a number of sentences or clauses were sorted and noted based on clauses and sentences of which the moods are declarative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The analysis was conducted by using descriptive qualitative method, in this case the data were analyzed based on how the language or linguistics properties work in the language. It works on the relation within the language units or linguistics properties. Based on arguments the verb assigns and what the filler of each argument, the arguments were mapped to its grammatical relation. In addition, the mapped grammatical relations were descriptively explained.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Review of Literature</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Yuniartati (2017) in an article, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Syntactic Functions of Deverbal Nouns Found in Huffington Post Website: Morphosyntactic Approach</span><span class="font3">, analyzed the nominal suffixes that certainly form noun and their syntactic function. The theory of suffixes by Quirk that form nouns was applied in recognizing the first problem, finding out the suffixes. The following theory, lexical functional grammar by Falk will be relevant with this study since similar understanding of syntactic function, another term of grammatical relation, is used to map the deverbal noun; in this study, the understanding of syntactic function is used to map the arguments, those are also nouns/ noun phrases. In addition, Dewi (2018) in an article entitled the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Morphosyntax of English Deverbal Noun in the Straits Times Website </span><span class="font3">also tried to recognize the suffixes those</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">form noun and their syntactic function. These two studies are relevant in terms of theory they use to analyze the syntactic function, that divides the syntactic function, another term of grammatical relation, into four functions – subject, object, complement, and adverbial. However, the two of those syntactic functions can be subcategorized, they are object, direct object and indirect object, and complement, subject and object complement. Accordingly, Darlina (2016) also used the same terms of grammatical relation, subject, object, complement, and adverbial. The same theory and understanding was also presented by Aryani (2019) who framed the theory of Quirk to refer the concept of grammatical function. However, this study tried to analyze the ellipsis of the function in coordinative structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Deborah (2018) in the study entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the Syntactic Function of Relative Clauses in A Game of Thrones Novel</span><span class="font3">, analyzed the syntactic function of nouns that modified by adjective or relative clause within that relative clause. It is relevant in term of understanding how to identify the function in either main or sub-ordinative clause. Marantz (2012) also presented relevance to this study in terms of arguments assigned by a verb. However, it focused on how the verb semantically requires participants. Furthermore, Nikolaeva (1999) also proved that grammatical relation is determined by grammatical properties; however, in Nothern Ostyak Language was also found having optional object agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An article entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Argument Structure at Syntax-Discourse Interface</span><span class="font3"> is also relevant to this study. This study was proposed Udayana (2016) on his article in the proceeding of the Third International Conference on English across Culture. The researcher tried to discover that argument is not only motivated by the lexico-semantics of a verb but it can be also the interface of syntax and discourse. Three constructions have the notion of information structure phenomena – dummy it, passive, and antipassive. In dummy it, it plays important role in preserving syntactic function or grammatical relation although it does not possess any semantic content. He therefore</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">concluded that it is the role of discourse, information structure or syntax. On the other hand, Bickel and Yadava (2000) presented verb agreements in Hindi. It is relevant in term of argument understanding although different terms used to refer the functions. In addition Branigan et al. (2008) presented relevant understanding. It is presented that subject and direct object functions are associated in active construction, while subject and oblique functions are associated in passive construction. However, that study focused on how animacy contributes to word order. Wong and Hancox (1998) also presented relevance in term of arguments understanding; however, it deals with semantic roles and how it is applied in translation. On another work, Taule et al. (2005) also presented mapping syntactic function into semantic roles. It is relevant in term of how the argument is determined and the functions used although oblique is not involved to the consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Artawa (2010) showed grammatical relation within some constructions in Balinese Language, zero and nasal, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ka-,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ma-</span><span class="font3"> construction. The grammatical subject is only clearly stated in nasal construction. On the other hand, the other constructions consist of agent argument. It is relevant that a grammatical subject can be determined by its grammatical properties and also its order syntactically. Accordingly, Arka and Wechsler (1998) also presented the same phenomena in Balinese Language, objective voice (OV) that has similar construction with zero construction in Artawa (2010). However, it is clear that the grammatical subject is determined by the words order since a patient argument in OV is considered as surface or grammatical subject. Yani (2018) also has relevant idea to this study regarding to direct and indirect object. It is proved that ditransitive verb is benefactivally marked in the verb to refer a following benefactive argument as a direct object. It is clear that grammatical relation is determined by the grammatical properties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Grammatical Relation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this study the data were analyzed by using the theory in term of grammatical relation proposed by Kroeger (2005).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Kroger (2005: 62), in order to express grammaticality, arguments must be assigned a grammatical relation within the clause. In addition, it is determined by the syntactic and morphological properties. The elements of grammatical relation will be mapped in to subject and object, and terms and oblique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Subject and Object</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Kroger (2005: 56), here are the following properties of subject and object in English:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Word order: In a basic English sentence, subject normally comes before the verb, and object and other elements come after the verb.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pronoun forms: Pronouns have special form when they appear in certain position that indicates whether they are subject or object pronouns.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement with verb: In the simple present tense, a morphological marking, a suffix -s, is added to the verb when a third person subject is singular. However, the number and person of the object or any other element in the sentence does not give any effect to the form of the verb.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content questions: If the subject is replaced by a question word (who or what), the rest of the sentence remains unchanged. However, if the object is replaced by a question word, there must be an auxiliary before the subject.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tag questions: A tag question is used to seek confirmation of a statement. It always contains a pronoun which refers back to the subject, and never to any other element in the sentence.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Supporting these criteria, Miller (2002: 93) explained some properties that become the criteria of grammatical subject.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syntactic properties including control of reflexives control of all and both floating and functioning as pivot in infinitives and coordinate constructions</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morpho-syntactic properties which includes argument being involved in person and number links with the finite verb and being in the nominative case.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Subject and object in a English sentence can be identified based on its grammatical properties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Terms and Oblique Arguments</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Kroger (2005: 57), subjects and objects are often referred to as terms, or direct arguments, while arguments which are not subjects or objects are called indirect or oblique arguments. Based on that understanding, we may conclude that subject and object have closer relationship comparing to oblique. In addition, oblique is marked or preceded by a preposition, while subject and object appear in bare noun phrase without being preceded by a preposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Adjunct and Oblique</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Kroeger (2005: 60) stated that time and manner phrases are adjuncts, rather than arguments. speakers might also put elements which are not really required by the predicate to make the flow of the story understood by the hearer(s) including time and place the event takes and the way of an action is done. In other word, Kroger (2005: 58) defined that elements which are not closely related to the meaning of the predicate but which are important to help the hearer understand the flow of the story are called adjunct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As described not really required by the predicate, an adjunct is not obligatory or always optional, while argument is obligatory. Besides that, an argument is bounded by the semantic role that is assigned by its predicate; therefore, certain predicate requires certain argument(s). In contrast, adjunct is semantically independent, and this is the reason why an adjunct may be freely added while argument is depended on the verb, and in addition, oblique is also obligatory as we can find also in PP that consists obligatory oblique argument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Primary and Secondary Object</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finding a verb consisting of two NPs object or ditransitive carries two terms of object, primary or direct object (OBJ), the first object appears after the verb, and secondary or indirect object (OBJ2) that appears after the primary object. However, people might be confused in determining OBJ2 or OBL since in traditional grammar, the grammatical relation of both might be the same. As described, the difference is that an OBL is marked by a preposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULT AND DISCUSSION</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Intransitive</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">On Thanksgiving and Easter, the whole congregation would eat together at the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Eat &lt;the whole congregation, the church&gt; I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Subject &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oblique</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The verb in this sentence is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">eat</span><span class="font3"> which is also preceded by an auxiliary verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">would</span><span class="font3">. Based on the term it assigns, the verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">eat</span><span class="font3"> is involved to intransitive since it only has one term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the whole congregation</span><span class="font3">. This term is considered as subject as it stands before the verb and its auxiliary </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">would eat</span><span class="font3">. Although it does not perform any pronoun form, the order or its position has shown its function syntactically. In addition, content question </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">who would eat together at the church?</span><span class="font3"> also shows that the replacement of the argument does not change the order of the phrases in the sentence. The inexistence of an argument before auxiliary proves that the only argument is the subject as well. On the other hand, the other argument, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the church</span><span class="font3">, is regarded as oblique since it appears after a preposition </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font3">. In regard with oblique, as one of arguments, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the church</span><span class="font3"> refers to a location where the action takes place. The prepositional phrase </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">on Thanksgiving and Easter</span><span class="font3"> seems similar to the oblique </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the church</span><span class="font3"> that comes after preposition </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font3">. However, it is not considered as oblique since it refers to time that is not regarded semantically required by the verb. As consequence, it is an adjunct of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Transitive</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">You wrote it</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wrote &lt;&nbsp;you , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Subject Object1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The form of verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">write</span><span class="font3"> can appears as transitive verb. The verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wrote</span><span class="font3"> which is the past form assigns two terms, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font3">. This study does not consider on the focus or the topic within both sentences of which the verb can assign one or two arguments. However, this study focuses on how many arguments a verb can syntactically assign. In this case, the verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wrote</span><span class="font3"> can be involved to transitive verb. The first term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font3"> is considered as subject</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">since it performs a pronoun form of subject. Although both its forms in subject and object are the same, its position has shown in function, that it comes before the verb. On the other hand, the term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font3"> comes after the verb and also performs an object pronoun form. Although it is similar with pronoun you in the way of having the same form in both subject and object, the position is again the answer. The following instrument is content question. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Who wrote it?</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">what did you write</span><span class="font3">? are the question which consists of question word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">who</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font3">. The first question word replaces the term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font3">, and the rest remain the same, while there is a slight change in the second question, the existence of auxiliary </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">did</span><span class="font3">. Therefore, the term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font3"> is regarded as subject, and the term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font3"> is regarded as object.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Dintransitive</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">My mom would always give me paper </span><span class="font3">Give &lt;&nbsp;my mom , me , paper &gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Subject Object1 Object2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">give</span><span class="font3"> is considered as ditransitive since there are three term arguments, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">my mom, me</span><span class="font3">, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">paper</span><span class="font3">, required by the verb. In other word, the predicate is involved to ditransitive verb since it takes two objects, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">me</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">paper</span><span class="font3">. These two term arguments are regarded as objects, primary and secondary object, since they come after the verb give. Besides their position, the primary object performs an object pronoun me that has different form with its subject. Although the secondary object </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">paper</span><span class="font3"> does not perform any pronoun form, its grammatical relation has been described by its position. The objects arrangement also determines whether it is primary or not; therefore, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">me</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">paper</span><span class="font3"> are regarded as primary and secondary object in sequence. On the other hand, the rest argument, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">my mom</span><span class="font3">, is regarded as subject, for it stands before the verb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word order and pronoun form have become the instruments to identify the grammatical relation. The following</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">instrument is content question, question word that is able to replace the argument. The first question word that replaces the subject of the sentence is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">who</span><span class="font3"> in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">who would always give me paper?</span><span class="font3">. Comparing to the declarative sentence, the difference is only found in the question word. The process only replaces the subject with a question word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">who</span><span class="font3"> without any changes of word order in the rest of the sentence. The following content questions will be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">who(m) would mom always give the paper?</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">what would mom always give me?</span><span class="font3">. Both questions perform changes of word order, the auxiliary </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">would</span><span class="font3"> move after the question word. Therefore, based on those three content questions, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">my mom</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">me</span><span class="font3">, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">paper</span><span class="font3"> are considered as subject and objects in sequence.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>CONCLUSIONS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">According to the discussion regarding arguments of English verbs, it is clear that an intransitive verb assigns a term that stands as subject, a transitive verb assigns two terms those stand as subject and primary object. On the other hand, a ditransitive verb assigns three terms those stand as subject, primary object, and secondary object. In addition, there is an argument that stands as oblique, an argument that appears after a preposition. In contrast, there is language unit that perform similar form to oblique, adjunct. It performs to refer time and manner and is always optional in the sentence.</span></p>
