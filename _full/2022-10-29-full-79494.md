<p><span class="font7">Becoming an entrepreneur is one of the opportunities for today's young generation, especially during a pandemic that causes them to lose their jobs. Efforts made by the government to facilitate the emergence of an entrepreneurial spirit are in the form of financial assistance and coaching needed by new entrepreneurs. This study observed three variables that can improve entrepreneurs' business performance: business models, marketing through social media, and product creativity. The three variables are distinguished by gender, membership in online communities, and period of being a food entrepreneur. The study results indicate differences between men and women in the business model and product creativity variables and their online food entrepreneurship community participation. However, there is no difference between men and women as community members on social media marketing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Keywords</span><span class="font7">: entrepreneurship, product creativity, business model, social media marketing, gender</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Perbedaan Model Bisnis Berbasis Gender, Partisipasi Komunitas Online, dan Masa Menjadi Pengusaha Terkait dengan Kreativitas Produk dan Pemasaran Sosial</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ABSTRAK</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Menjadi wirausahawan merupakan salah satu peluang bagi generasi muda saat ini, terutama di masa pandemi yang menyebabkan mereka kehilangan pekerjaan. Upaya yang dilakukan pemerintah untuk memfasilitasi munculnya jiwa wirausaha berupa bantuan dana dan pembinaan yang dibutuhkan oleh wirausahawan baru. Dalam penelitian ini dilakukan observasi terhadap tiga variabel yang dapat meningkatkan kinerja bisnis wirausahawan yaitu model bisnis, pemasaran melalui media sosial, dan kreativitas produk. Ketiga variabel tersebut dibedakan berdasarkan jenis kelamin, keanggotaan dalam komunitas online, dan masa menjadi pengusaha makanan. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan perbedaan antara laki-laki dan perempuan dalam variabel model bisnis dan kreativitas produk, serta partisipasi mereka dalam komunitas wirausaha makanan online. Namun, tidak ada perbedaan antara pria dan wanita sebagai anggota komunitas dalam pemasaran media sosial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kata kunci</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">: kewirausahaan, kreativitas produk, model bisnis, pemasaran media sosial, gender</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Gender is a fascinating subject in research. Gender equality and diversity in the world of work still target continuously being pursued worldwide, including in Indonesia. Gender equality in the world of work is a form of implementing equality by providing opportunities for every individual to have a career and develop themselves without distinguishing between men and women. Women are seen as less capable of managing a business than men. Discrimination occurs in the lack of opportunities offered to women in education and management positions in firms (Jadiyappa, Jyothi, Sireesha, &amp;&nbsp;Hickman, 2019). women are</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">considered more averse to the risks they face and are less able to have long-term planning skills, so that they are considered lacking in management positions (Simerly &amp;&nbsp;Gan, 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In running a personal business or entrepreneurship, the same perception occurs towards women. However, the number of women who do their own business is relatively high, especially in the food business. The food business is mainly done by housewives and the younger generation, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many new entrepreneurs, both male, and female become members of the online entrepreneurial community. One of the reasons to get involved in online communities is to gain knowledge in managing a business, sharing experiences, and doing business. Online communities interact with people who share the same experiences, problems, and desires (Galarneau, 2002). A virtual community is people in a group who carry out touch in a structured manner through newsgroups (Chen &amp;&nbsp;Hung, 2010). The existence of online communities is increasingly widespread during the pandemic by utilizing technological developments, members can communicate freely through virtual meetings. The organization identifies the needs of online community members, accommodates their needs, and communicates effectively to increase the satisfaction level of the online community (Kang &amp;&nbsp;Park, 2018)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Apart from being based on gender and being a member of an online community, this research also focuses on how long it takes someone to start a business. Time is one of the factors that determines the success of entrepreneurs to survive in the face of business competition. A nascent entrepreneur is an entrepreneur who has just started a business within 3-42 months (Reynolds &amp;&nbsp;Curtin, 2011).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Food entrepreneur is one of the businesses with intense competition. An entrepreneur must have preparation in running his business to survive. To compete and be recognized by consumers, entrepreneurs must make products with distinctive characteristics compared to similar products that already exist in the market. Creativity is an essential factor for entrepreneurs that can be applied to various aspects of their business. Creativity is the capacity to develop new ideas and find new ways of facing problems and opportunities. Creativity is a source of innovation and motivation to produce a brand new idea into something regarded as being practical (Amabile &amp;&nbsp;Pratt, 2016). Creativity is an original idea and functional (Runco &amp;&nbsp;Jaeger, 2012) and developed something different from what already exists (Althuizen &amp;&nbsp;Reichel, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Meanwhile, Product creativity is a subjective evaluation of a product that shows its novelty and usefulness (Horn &amp;&nbsp;Salvendy, 2006). Humans create innovative products through a creative process as a result of innovations. Products are considered more as a result of human processes than as a new creation. Product creativity is an appraisal given by customers from product uniqueness's level differ from competitor product (Hong, Song, &amp;&nbsp;Yoo, 2013). Creating innovative products will attract consumers to the products offered. There are six significant dimensions of creativity in making a product: novelty, resolution, emotion, centrality, importance, and desire (Horn &amp;&nbsp;Salvendy, 2006).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to having a unique product, entrepreneurs need to develop their abilities and knowledge in running a business through technological developments—one of the conveniences offered by technological developments in social media. Social marketing is effective and doesn't cost a lot. Social media marketing is a process that encourages individuals to conduct promotion activity of their products, websites, or services through online and social channels. And to carry out communication by leveraging a much bigger community who are more likely to carry out marketing activity than through traditional advertising channels (Weinberg, 2009). Social media marketing uses social media platforms to connect with your audience to build your brand, increase sales and drive website traffic. Marketing through social media involves creating great content on your social media profiles, listening to and engaging your followers, analyzing your results, and advertising social media. Tuten (2008) mentions</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">marketing by social media forms of online advertising that uses the cultural context of social communities, including social, virtual worlds, social news sites, and sites of social opinion sharing. The purpose of social media marketing is to fulfill communication targets. Social media marketing is a relatively new marketing opportunity. Still, it can advertise directly to groups' social niches based on the profile information through Instagram, Bebo, Facebook, Myspace, and others (Ryan &amp;&nbsp;Jones, 2009). Elements of social media marketing (Gunelius, 2011b) include content creation, Content Sharing, Connecting, Community Building Web</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Business planning is done before the business starts. Business is a group of decision variables such as architecture, economics, and business strategy that are handled to yield a competitive advantage (Morris, Schindehutte, &amp;&nbsp;Allen, 2005). Business performance is affected by changing environmental factors, as well as business models. A business model is a fundamental concept of how a business will be run, both internally and externally. In other words, the business model describes how the company is connected to the market. Internally, the business model determines how the business organization will be built to continue to grow well. While externally, the business model helps determine what value is offered to consumers and how to profit from the business being run. The definition of a business model is a model that pictures how a company is engaged in making a profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Furthermore, the business model is used to strategize how the company will make money and maintain profits (Stewart &amp;&nbsp;Zhao, 2000). Osterwalder states that the business model is a plan, sketch, or blueprint of how companies do business (Osterwalder, Pigneur, &amp;&nbsp;Tucci, 2005). Amir and Zott defined the business model as a system and interdependent activities representing a firm's ability to do business with partners, customers, and vendors (Amit &amp;&nbsp;Zott, 2012). The business model consists of 9 building blocks (Osterwalder, Alexander &amp;&nbsp;Pigneur, 2018): customer segment, value propositions, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, resources, key activities, key partnerships, and structure cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In this study, we will analyze the differences in the views of nascent entrepreneurs in the food sector on the variables of creative products, social media marketing, and business models based on gender, being a member of an online community, and being an entrepreneur. The contribution of the research is to analyze the differences in nascent food entrepreneurs not only based on gender but based on being involved in the online entrepreneurial community and how long they have been an entrepreneur to give more comprehend results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">METHOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The variables considered to improve the sustainability of food businesses in this study are business models, creative products, and social media marketing. The population is food entrepreneurs in Jakarta with 214 people. Questionnaire questions are divided into two parts: the respondent's profile and questions about variables that affect sustainability's business. The indicator assessment uses a Likert scale of one to five (1 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree). This research utilized an online questionnaire of which reliability and validity were tested before distributing to the target respondents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The data analysis method used in a study is a technique of quantitative descriptive and qualitative descriptive. The quantitative descriptive method is data analysis based on numbers, percentages, frequencies, averages, diagrams, or graphs where descriptive statistics can be used. At the same time, the descriptive method of Qualitative analysis is based on a state statement. The t-test difference test is used for determining whether the two samples are not related have a different average value. The t-test difference test was carried out by comparing the difference between two values mean with standard error of the average of the two samples. Standard error difference in the mean value distributed normally. It can be concluded that the t-test difference test is to compare the average of two groups that are not related to each other.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The value proposition is one of the essential elements in the marketing process. The value proposition will make it easier for business people to show the advantages of their products to customers. Frow dan Payne (2011) described a value proposition as something a firm promises benefits customers will obtain during and after usage. The value proposition is one of the essential elements that every businessperson must pay attention to if his product or service wants to sell and be chosen by many customers. Value propositions try to solve the problems that customers face and satisfy customer needs achieving the value proposition requires creative ideas for answering and finding what customers need. The abilities of men and women are different in initiating innovation (Cedric Herring, 2009).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Key activities between males and females are also different in this study and based on becoming an entrepreneur. Key activities are the important actions that the company must take for its operations to be successful. Entrepreneurs plan key activities at the beginning of their business planning. Key activities are the business's key activitie</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">s </span><span class="font9">representing what the company must do to make the business model work (Osterwalder, Alexander &amp;&nbsp;Pigneur, 2018). The primary activity is what you do with your primary resource. Activities carried out by an entrepreneur in achieving key activities such as improvements in marketing, product design, increasing technological capabilities, opening new collaboration networks, and carrying out better management. A prior study showed apparent differences between men and women in business creation due to overt discrimination or systemic factors (Grosser &amp;&nbsp;Moon, 2019).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Based on participating in an online community, there is a difference between males and females in key resources and partnerships. The key resource is a partition in the business model canvas that contains a list of resources that companies should plan and have to realize their value proposition. Key Resources can be physical, intellectual, human, financial, and relational. Meanwhile, key partners are parties that you can collaborate with to support and optimize the allocation of resources, reduce risk and uncertainty of competition, and improve performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Key Resources are the primary assets that businesses use to function effectively. To use resources effectively can be done by finding a place of business that is cheap to rent, has good access, and most importantly, has a contract with a supplier of raw materials—key resources needed in developing new business creation. Men and women were different in achieving their goals in business creation, starting a business by identifying opportunities and implementing strategies (Harrison, Leitch, &amp;&nbsp;Mcadam, 2015). This result supports the finding in our research that there is a difference between males and females based on key resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The result shows that based on gender, there are n differences in social media marketing. But based on participating in social media marketing, all the indicators are different. Then, based on the period of becoming an entrepreneur also other in community building web. Elements of social media marketing include content creation, Content Sharing, Connecting, Community Building Web (Gunelius, 2011a). Women rarely major in engineering or</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">computers and are related to technology, so that there are differences between men and women in gaining the trust of investors regarding technological factors (Reynolds &amp;&nbsp;Curtin, 2011).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The result of product creativity in this study found that based on gender, there are two indicators different: novelty and arousal. Meanwhile, online business has four various indicators: novelty, elaboration, pleasure, and arousal. Then, the last, the period of becoming an entrepreneur is found in the novelty of an entrepreneur. A prior study found that women and men have different motivations for creating new businesses (meeting a need vs. taking advantage of an opportunity (Kelley, Evans, Lowman, &amp;&nbsp;Lykes, 2017). In contrast to men, women seem to experiment with their firm's business model to improve the firm's capabilities and enhance its performance directly (Lopez-Nicolas, Nikou, Molina-Castillo, &amp;&nbsp;Bouwman, 2020).</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">This study concludes that there are differences in the factors that influence the performance of entrepreneurs. Namely, business models, social media marketing, and product creativity are distinguished by gender, the participation of entrepreneurs in online communities, and the length of time entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs, which in this study are limited to above and below one year. In general, men and women have similarities in running a business, but several indicators have differences. It shows that there are still differences between men and women, even though only slightly as entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Being an online community related to entrepreneurship provides significant benefits to an entrepreneur. This can be seen in the factor of using social media marketing. All indicators show distinct differences if they are distinguished by gender or the length of time an entrepreneur becomes an entrepreneur. Finally, the length of time a person runs a business shows differences in product creation or product creativity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This research contributes to the entrepreneurial theory that the characteristics of entrepreneurs can make a difference in running a business. The characteristics of entrepreneurs discussed are gender, being a member of an online community, and the duration of being an entrepreneur. The limitation of this research is that there is still a lack of discussion related to the similarities in the indicators of business models, social media marketing, and product creativity. Further research is needed regarding other factors outside the business model, social media marketing, and product creativity discussed in this study to gain more complete results.</span></p>
