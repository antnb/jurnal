<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">Indonesia is a vast unitary country with a rich diversity of human and natural resources, so it requires the right strategy in planning and implementing its development (Dahuri, 2001). Resource management in Indonesia is inseparable from the basic ideology of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia, namely Pancasila. Suhardin, (2012), Pancasila as the basis of the state must be implemented in every program or strategy used in the development or achievement of the goals of the Indonesian state which must be based on the Almighty God, Prosperity for the Indonesian people, Indonesian unity, a society led by a just and civilized society, and social justice for all Indonesian people. Pancasila itself has points that are covered in the Maqashid Sharia, namely protecting religion, guarding the soul, maintaining reason, protecting descendants and protecting property. Both have the same goal, namely for the benefit. Ahmad (2011), Pancasila and maqashid syariah which aim for the benefit of humanity which are defined as everything related to human sustenance, fulfillment and acquisition of everything that is demanded by emotional and intellectual qualities, in an absolute sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The main purpose of sharia is to encourage the benefit (welfare) of humans which lies in the preservation of religion, life, reason, descent and wealth. Furthermore, anything that protects these five elements of the public interest is highly recommended. on the contrary, everything that threatens him must be eliminated (Chapra, 2000).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pancasila contains 5 elements and aspects of Divinity, Humanity, Unity, Wisdom and Wisdom and Justice. Basically, the elements contained in Pancasila itself are very closely related to Islam, so it can be said that Islamic norms and values already exist and are contained and become the principles for Indonesian society in general. If demanded in accordance with Islamic norms and values in the Pancasila ideology, we will find that (Fuad, 2012):</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The First Precept: One Godhead. This precept is found in the Koran, Surat Al Ikhlas verse 1. It means, &quot;Say, he is Allah, the One. Second Sila: Just and Civilized Humanity. This precept is in the Alquran An Nisa 135. The translation is: &quot;O you who believe. Be the enforcer of your justice, be a witness for God even though yourself or your mother and your father and your relatives. If he (the accused) is rich or poor, then Allah know more about the benefits (goodness). Then do not follow lust because you want to deviate from the truth. And if you turn away (words) or are reluctant to be a witness, then know that Allah is Checking everything you do. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Meanwhile, the third precept is the Indonesian Unity. This precept is also in Al-Surah Al- Hujurat verse 13. The translation is: &quot;O people, We actually created you from a man and woman and made you a nation -nation and tribe so that you know each other. The noblest among you by Allah is the most pious among you. Allah knows best. &quot;This verse is very suiTable considering that Indonesia consists of various tribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Furthermore, in the fourth precept where democracy is led by the wisdom of wisdom in consultation / representation. This</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">precept is also in the Koran as Shuro 38. The translation is: &quot;And (for) those who accept (obey) the summons of their Rabb, and establish their prayers, their affairs are (decided) by deliberation among them; and they spend part of their wealth. , which We gave them. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The last precept is social justice for all Indonesian people. This precept is also found in the Koran in An Nahl verse 90. The translation is: &quot;Surely Allah commands (humans) to do justice and do good, to give (alms) to relatives, and Allah forbids cruelty, evil and enmity. He teaches you ( people), so you can take lessons&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It that reinforce Islamic values contained even before Indonesia's independence, since the independence of Indonesia is inseparable from the role of scholars and Muslim hero (Ahmad, 2011). Thus maqashid sharia can be used as the main reference in the pace of development steps carried out, especially for a country, especially a country with a majority Muslim population. Indonesia, which is a predominantly Muslim country with the Pancasila ideology, both of which have the same goal, must have a development and development model that is beneficial to humanity or its society. So that in this study the researcher aims to analyze the development programs of the Indonesian government from various fields of economy, social, politics, religion, education, culture and so on in the review of maqashid Islam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Maqashid Sharia in the language according to Al Syatibi consists of two words, namely maqashid and al-sharia. Maqashid</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">means intentional or purposeful, while al-syariah means a path to a water source or as a path to the main source of life (Ahmad, 2011). The terms of the meaning of Maqashid Shari'ah that were put forward by several previous scholars include: The concept of Maqashid Shari'ah according to Al-Imam Al-Syaitibi, that &quot;Shari'ah really aims to realize the benefit of humans as servants of God in the world and the hereafter. Therefore, when His servants are burdened with obligations (alternative), it is nothing but to bring about benefit, so that in his view there is not a single law which has no purpose&quot;. Riyadi (2014), this is different from the concept of maqashid sharia according to Al-Imam Al-Ghazali, that&quot; Maintaining the aims and objectives of this Sharia is a fundamental effort to survive, the damage factor cuts and encourages prosperity. &quot;&nbsp;According to Al-Ghazali that the welfare of a society depends on hifdzun (religion), hifzhun nafs (soul), hifdzul 'aql (intellect), hifzhun nasl (descent) and hifzhul maal (wealth) whose ultimate goal is to achieve the goodness of the world and the hereafter. The benefits of al-din wa al-dunya (Karim, 2014).</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/63701-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:213pt;height:79pt;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Figure 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Five Main Elements in Maqashid Sharia</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The maintenance of these five main goals is a basic human need, namely the absolute group that must be fulfilled so that</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">humans can live happily in this world and the hereafter. In addition, Imam Asy-Syaitibi has classified Maqashid Sharia into maslahah levels, namely necessity (dharuriyah), complement (hajiyah), and improvement (tahsiniyat). Karim (2014), this is as stated in QS. Al-Jatsiyah: 18 which is &quot;Then We have made you take a course in adultery, therefore follow it, and do not follow the low desires of those who do not know”</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/63701-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:222pt;height:147pt;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Priority Scale Based on Maslahah Side</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus Maqashid Sharia is the path to the goal of life, which is to create prosperity and benefit for all people in the world and in the hereafter. In addition, humans can obtain protection and benefit from all the provisions of sharia and are able to avoid harm (mafsadah daf'ul) and in maintaining the maqashid of sharia must pay attention to their priorities. In several studies such as Dar (2004) where Maqashid Syariah is used as an indicator of socio-economic development where policies in development will be in line with Maqashid Syariah, but both still have some differences in determining indicators that are considered capable of representing maqashid sharia. However, this research</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">cannot be separated of the welfare approach (Dar, 2004). Syed &amp;&nbsp;Hasan (2014) are the only ones who have so far tried to make quite different measurements in socio-economic development. In addition, research that explicitly focuses on the Maqashid Sharia index was carried out by Arifqi (2020); Solihin (2019); Asmuni (2014); Rama &amp;&nbsp;Makhlan (2013) who examine related maqasyid sharia in order to formulate a development concept in accordance with Sharia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To carry out their functions, humans need media in the form of government. Media governance is very important for humans so that human relations can be maintained properly. Humans are required to maintain harmony in all interactions and government has an important role to play in maintaining harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The government has the right to intervene in the economic sector carried out by individuals, both to supervise activities carried out by economic actors and to regulate matters relating to the economy but can not be done by individuals (Mannan, 2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The government is the mandate holder to carry out joint tasks in realizing justice and prosperity as well as a good life order for all society. As a mandate holder, the existence and role of this government has a solid foundation in the Koran and Sunnah, both explicitly and implicitly. The role of the state is treated in the instrument and functionalization of Islamic economic values in the aspects of law, planning, planning, management and supervision. Therefore, the government as the beneficial owner of </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">economic resources is society, including</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">production and distribution as well as institutions that oversee economic life. Disturbing the government does not mean that the government has the right to monopolize all of the country's economic resources. All proceeds from government intervention aim to produce godly individuals and communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The text of the Koran and Sunnah explicitly and implicitly mentions the role played by the government. These roles are: 1) Punlik wealth management in order to maximize public interest. 2) Fulfill all the requirements to build a country that can effectively protect society and its cultural, economic, religious and political interests. 3) Utilizing revenue to finance public administration and government tasks. 4) Ensuring individuals can increase efficiency and the degree of wealth and welfare. 5) Maintaining social and economic balance, especially the distribution and redistribution of wealth / income. 6) Protect the economic environment so that it remains in accordance with Islamic values and principles. P3EI (2008); Qardhawi (2000) explained that the duty of the state is to change thoughts into deeds, transfer morality to concrete practices, establish various institutions and institutions that can carry out the task of guarding and developing all of these. Qardhawi, (2000), task state should also monitor the implementation of the obligations required indiscipline and punish those who are violating or ignoring harassment in a common life. Al-Ghazali provided detailed comments and advice on the procedures for state affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">National development is an effort to advance all aspects of the life of the community, nation and state which is at the same time the process of developing the entire state administration system to achieve national goals. In another sense, the embodiment of national development can be interpreted as a series of sustainable national development efforts which can be interpreted as a series of development efforts that carry out the task of realizing national goals. Budiyanto (2018), implementation of development embodies aspects of national life, namely political, economic, sociocultural, and national security aspects that are planned, comprehensive, and national in order to create a life that is equal and equal to others. developed countries. Therefore, in fact national development is a reflection of the willingness to continue to improve the people's welfare and the implementation of a developed country and democracy based on Pancasila (Budiyanto, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Budiyanto (2018), the essence of national development is the development of the Indonesian nation as a whole and the development of Indonesian society as a whole. This means that in implementing national development the following matters are required: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">First,</span><span class="font2"> There is harmony, harmony, balance, and unanimity in all development activities . Development for humans and non-humans for development. In today's development, the human element, socio-cultural elements, and other elements must receive balanced attention. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Second, </span><span class="font2">development must be fair to all communities and across the country. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Third,</span><span class="font2"> namely </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">the subjects and objects of development are</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Buletin Studi Ekonomi </span><span class="font0">139</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the people and people of Indonesia, so development must have an Indonesian character as well. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fourth,</span><span class="font2"> development is carried out jointly by the community and government. The community is the main actor in development and the government is obliged to direct, guide and create a supportive atmosphere. Community activities and government activities must mutually support, complement and complement each other in one step towards achieving the goals of national development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">National development is carried out to realize national goals as stipulated in the Preamble of the 1945 Constitution paragraph IV, namely protecting all Indonesian people and all Indonesia, advancing public welfare, advancing the life of the nation, and participating in world order based on independence, eternal peace and social justice, and realizing the ideals of the nation as stated in paragraph II of the Preamble of the 1945 Constitution (Budiyanto, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mentioned in the 2015-2019 RPJMN, the main problems faced in efforts to achieve development are: (1) Decreasing state authority, (2) Weakening of the joints of the national economy, and (3) Spreading intolerance and a national personality crisis. The main challenges of development are political and security stabilization, efficient and effective bureaucracy, eradicating corruption, increasing economic growth, accelerating equity and justice, sustainable development, improving the quality of human resources (HR) and disparities between regions, and accelerating maritime affairs. development. Seeing the main problems and challenges faced, as well</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">as the achievements of development so far, the vision for the 2015-2019 national midterm development is the realization of a sovereign, independent, and personalitybased spirit based on mutual cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Efforts to realize this vision are spelled out through seven medium-term development missions, namely: 1) Realizing national security that is capable of maintaining regional sovereignty, sustaining economic independence by securing maritime resources, and reflecting Indonesia's personality as an archipelagic nation; 2) Realizing an advanced, balanced and democratic society based on law; 3) Creating a free and active foreign policy and strengthening its identity as a maritime country; 4) Realizing a quality, advanced, and prosperous Indonesian human life; 5) creating a competitive nation; 6) Realizing Indonesia to become a maritime country that is independent, advanced, resilient and based on the national interest ; and 7) Creating a culture-oriented society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The vision and mission of national mid-term development for 2015-2019 is further formulated in nine priority agendas or called Nawacita, namely: 1) reviving the state to protect the entire nation and providing a sense of security for all citizens; 2) Realizing a government that is always present by building a clean, effective, democratic and reliable government; 3) Developing Indonesia from the periphery by strengthening regions and villages within the framework of a unitary state; 4) Strengthening the existence of the state in reforming the system and law enforcement that is free of corruption, dignified and reliable; 5) Improve the quality</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of life of the people and society of Indonesia; 6) Increase the productivity and competitiveness of the people in the international market so that the Indonesian people can advance and rise together with other Asian nations; 7) Realizing economic independence by moving strategic sectors of the domestic economy; 8) Carry out a national character revolution; and 9) Strengthening diversity and strengthening Indonesia's social restoration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Development norms applied in the 2015-2019 RPJMN are: 1) Development is holistic in a comprehensive manner, taking into account all related dimensions; 2) Human and community development must empower the community to be independent and not cause the community to become weak (entitled people); 3) Development does not create widening inequality; 4) Development must not damage and reduce the carrying capacity of the environment and ecosystem; and 5) Development must encourage private sector growth and not just kill existing businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some research that specifically examines economic development based on maqasyid sharia is still very rare, many of the researchers study the concept of development in general which examines the macroeconomic and microeconomic conditions of a country (Budiyanto, 2018), while other research such as Dahuri (2001); Suhardin (2012); Ahmad (2011) studied separate economic development or did not link economic development or economic growth with the concept of maqasyid sharia. In addition, research that explicitly focuses on the Maqashid Syariah index was conducted</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">by Amiruddin (2020); Rasool </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font2">, (2012); Bedoui, (2014); Ghazal &amp;&nbsp;Zulkhibri, (2014); Mili (2014); Kasri &amp;&nbsp;Ahmed (2015).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on previous research, there is a gap to be researched, namely research related to national development programs associated with maqasyid sharia to get different results or as novelty in this research . So that the final objective of this research is to examine the national development program which is based on Maqasyid sharia.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>METHODOLOGY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">This research uses a qualitative approach where the purpose of qualitative research is to understand the phenomenon of what is caused by the research subject, in a holistic descriptive manner in the form of words and language, in a special natural context and by utilizing various scientific methods (Moloeng, 2017). This study uses a qualitative approach because it will analyze the development program of the Indonesian government to achieve Maqashid Syariah through the application of Islamic philanthropic institutions in Indonesia, so that the analysis used is to compare or comparison, and synthesis with researchers or existing literature sources. Due to the nature of the literature review, the measurement of variables is descriptive analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This research data collection technique through library research which is a technique of collecting data from various relevant reference materials and examining the issues to be discussed. Literature study is a data collection method aimed at finding</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">data and information through documents such as written documents, photos, images, and electronic documents that can support the writing process (Sugiyono, 2012). Data obtained through literature study is a source of information found by competent experts in their respective fields so that it is relevant to the discussion under study (Moloeng, 2017). Due to its descriptive analysis, neither the population nor the sample were used in this study.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">In connection with the problem of managing national natural resources, it is necessary to look for alternatives to national development that prioritize people's sovereignty in order to realize social justice and the welfare of the wider community (Kuswandi, 2015). The alternative referred to is to refer to universal law, namely Islamic religious law, namely the theory of maqashid syari'at. The universality of maqashid shari'ah is felt, comprehensive, systemic and integral to human needs. Not only for the needs and protection of property, but includes the basic dimensions of human rights, namely heredity, mind, spirit and religion. Maqashid syari'at theory, which is considered appropriate and capable of following the current global development, is said to be a case of fiqh's proposal which reads: &quot;keep the old and bring the new better. &quot;&nbsp;In essence, the theory of maqashid syari'at is in line with the theory of social justice and people's sovereignty as referred to in the Pancasila ideology and the 1945 Constitution. Maqashid syari'ah as</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">a legal epistemology is an important discussion in Islamic law, as one of the ijtihad methods that have been developed by scholars. several centuries ago and is the result of brilliant achievements in the field of legal thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With al-maqashid sharia as one of the epistemologies of Islamic law, it is hoped that it will be able to build laws that are able to function in realizing &quot;jalb al-mashalih wa daf'u al-mafasid&quot; so as to create stability in life, realize justice, benefit and prosperity in human life in world and al-fauz bi al-jannah wa an-najat min an-naar which means in the hereafter and that is the highest benefit for humans and that is the essence of maqashid shari'ah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">According to Umar Capra in Katmas (2018) about the economy in perspective maqashid al-Sharia, which is one element of the nation or the state of development described in Table 1. The role of the Indonesian government in maintaining the maqashid of sharia through programs or policies carried out by the government. In the formation and implementation of the program, a National and Regional MediumTerm Development Plan has been drawn up, which the plan is used as a reference in making programs by various ministries and related institutions that are responsible in their respective fields. Development in Indonesia is a sustainable development that has several stages, at this time the development stage is in the second stage, which is known as the 2015-2019 RPJMN.</span></p>

Some of the monetary measures taken by the Government of Indonesia are 1) Increasing the coordination of policy stakeholders to increase the effectiveness of policies at the central and regional levels, among others through the Inflation Control Team (TPI), Regional TPI, and Macro Assumption Team; 2) Strengthening structural policies to support sustainable economic growth, including the implementation of the roadmap for reducing fuel subsidies in line with the conversion of renewable energy consumption to a more environmentally friendly manner, policies in the financial sector, particularly financial market deepening, and policies in the real sector. ; 3) Improve discipline in maintaining the stability and sustainability of</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">The government is the mandate holder to carry out joint tasks in realizing justice and prosperity as well as a good life order for all society. As a mandate holder, the existence and role of this government has a solid foundation in the Koran and Sunnah, both explicitly and implicitly. The role of the state is treated in the instrument and functionalization of Islamic economic values in the aspects of law, planning, planning, management and supervision. Therefore, the government as the beneficial owner of economic resources is the community, including production and distribution as well as life regulatory agencies. This interference with the government does not mean that the government has the right to monopolize all of the country's economic resources. All the results of government intervention are aimed at producing &nbsp;religious &nbsp;individuals and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Indonesia through its government policies and programs has succeeded in maintaining 5 elements of maqashid sharia, namely hifdzun in (Religion), hifzhun nafs (Jiwal), hifdzul 'aql (Intellect), hifzhun nasl (descent) and hifzhul maal (wealth) which means that the Indonesian nation has a good opportunity. able to achieve goodness in this world and the hereafter. However, Indonesia is a very large country, so the process of achieving maqashid sharia</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">safeguards requires extra manpower so that it can be achieved 100% by all Indonesian citizens. At present, efforts are still being made to achieve the program and the resolution of government problems, both central and regional governments, so that the percentage of achievement varies from various programs. The number of government programs cannot be fully discussed in this study so there is a need for further discussion of other government programs that are able to guard the five elements of maqashid sharia.</span></p>
