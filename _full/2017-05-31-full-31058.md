<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Abstract</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This article tries to analyze and discuss the politeness strategies employed by the trainers in room division department when they practice on the job training in the hotel. Politeness strategy was needed when the trainers serve the guest. This research was done by observation and interview with the trainer and the guest about their conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The analysis of politeness strategies that employed by the trainer focused on two discussions; (1) the kinds of politeness strategies used by trainer in room division department, and (2) the implications of politeness strategies used by trainer in room division department. This research used the theory from Brown &amp;&nbsp;Levinson (1987) in his book entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usages</span><span class="font3">. The theory is supported by other theories that are considered relevant to the topic of discussion in this research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the analysis, it was found that there were two kinds of politeness stratgies that employed by the trainer in room division department Bapepar Nusa Dua, they were positive face and negative face. Beside that, there are three implications by using politness strategies such as: respect behaviour, togheterness, and cooperative interaction.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>I INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">When we talk about language, there are many definitions of language, and one another look like similar. Language like other form of society activity has to be appropriate to the speaker using it. Language has special meaning to human beings when they do kinds of communication. According to Keyton (2011) communication is the process of transmitting information and common understanding from one person to another. So, it means that communication is an activity where two people contribute in conveying and receiving messages or information. Furthermore, Cheney (2011) explains there are some processes of communication, they are: the sender or the speaker is a person who has need or desire to convey an idea or concept to others. The receiver or the hearer is the individual to whom the messages or the information is sent. The information that sent could be in the form of verbal, nonverbal or written language. This is as the feedback for the receiver or hearer as they receive the information from the speaker. Thus, Grice (1975) states that communication should be explained in the form of social interaction whose success depends on interact presumption that communication is driven by certain norms and rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Considering the language used by people in communication, certainly the language used by people in certain places is concerned with social and cultural phenomena, (Trudgill, 1983). It means that the language used in the society deals with the social values or social norms which are developed there, because language and society bound each-other. In addition, language stays and walks together with culture that influences the language used. The language used in culture is a complex one due largely in part to the great difficulty in understanding people’s cognitive processes when they communicate. So, language and culture are supposed to be part of the communication among the society. Besides, language is also related with the place where and when the language is used (Hymes, 1994). Thus, people in society use the language based on their culture and social norms which are agreed and accepted by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Commonly, the speaker wants to have a good and polite behavior when they make communication with the hearer. This is due to how the speaker or people wants to keeps or have good relationship with the hearer. People live together in a society and do available conventions or norms in the social society where the politeness as a strategy to avoid conflict that might be happened and also in order to develop good relationship or togetherness in social interaction (Watts, 2003; Rash, 2004). It is very important if speaker uses politeness as a strategy in order to make communication with other people of social community running well. Seken (2007) stated that when talking about politeness in the communication, language will be seen as a behavior of human in the social interaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Politeness is the key point when people serve the client in hospitality industry. It is very important if the speaker uses politeness in communication. Moreover, when people obey all of the conventions, regulations, norms, values, in the society and keep the good relationship or togetherness in a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">communication, then it means polite. I would like to analyze my discussion about politeness strategies used by trainer in room division department. The discussion focuses on the following points (1) what are the kinds of politeness strategies used by trainer in room division department; and (2) what are the implications of politeness strategies used by trainer in room division department.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>II MATERIALS AND METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Many social factors can into controlling the politeness. Politeness in speaking, courtesy, or etiquette is a procedure, custom, or custom prevailing in the society. It also as politeness is the rules of conducting establishment and agreed upon jointly by a particular community concluded as social behavior. Politeness is rules of behavior which is agreed together by the society where it is applied. In the real life that is occurred in the society politeness can be seen from the various facets of everyday interaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The researcher followed the descriptive qualitative as a design of this research study where all of aspect which related to the interaction between clerk or trainer and the guest involved and the strategy that related to the politeness are investigated in depth and explain in details. Descriptive-qualitative research was a research which investigated the quality of relationships, activities, situations, or materials (Fraenkel &amp;&nbsp;Wallen, 1993). As the researcher following the descriptive qualitative research, the investigation is done by the observation to the interactive event.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OLITENESS STRATEGY</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Practically, politeness is a strategy used in communication in order to avoid the conflict between the speaker and the hearer, especially used by the teacher and the student in classroom interaction in order to create harmonious relationship between teacher and students. Besides, to build students’ consciousness and motivation in employing their language to be polite and well accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the contrary, Brown &amp;&nbsp;Levinson (1987) provide a slightly different perspective about politeness. As they followed the Goffman’s theory of face, they concerned on the FTA (Face Threatening Act) because every interlocutor and addressee have face and this face sometimes could be threaten. Face-threatening act (FTA) is acts that infringe on the hearer’s need to maintain his/her selfesteem and be respected. So, by conducting politeness in conversation interaction, one can avoid the effect of face threatening. In line with that, Brown and Levinson state that politeness is the speaker’s strategy to minimize the effect of an FTA (Face Threatening Act) in communication. As such, in an event of interaction, the threat to the face can concern either the speaker or the addressee, or even both, depending on the kind of act that is at issue (Brown &amp;&nbsp;Levinson, 1987).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The rational actions take to preserve both kinds of face, for themselves and the people they interact with, add up to politeness. Politeness in interaction can be defined as a means employed to show awareness of another person’s face. In this sense, politeness can be accomplished in situation of social distance or closeness. Brown &amp;&nbsp;Levinson also argue that in human communication, either spoken or written, people tend to maintain one another’s face continuously. In everyday conversation, people adapt conversation to different situations. For example showing awareness for another person’s face when that other seems socially distance is often described in term of respect and deference. The term of respect and deference here means speaker want to keep good relationship with hearer. The other example among friends, she/he takes liberties or says things that would seem discourteous among others and they avoid over formality with them. In both situations they try to avoid making the hearer embarrassed or uncomfortable. Thus, Brown and Levinson emphasized the application of politeness strategy in order to minimize the threat to the face and dealing with that FTA. Brown &amp;&nbsp;Levinson (1987) claim that particular kind of act can threaten face, that is, the act that contras to what the face needs from the speaker. This is call face threatening act. FTA is seen as utterance or action that threatens person face. Some acts can threaten the hearers’ negative face. Negative face is the desire of every competent adult member to have freedom of action, freedom of imposition, and not to be impeded by others. Furthermore, some others can threaten positive face of the hearer. Positive acts is the need of every member that his wants to be appreciated and accepted, to be treated as the member of the same group, and to know that his or her wants are shared by others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Basically, negative face as the basic claim to territories, personal preserves, right to nondistraction, such as: freedom from imposition, therefore, negative face emphasize other’s rights and freedom. In the other hand, positive face as the positive consistent self-image or personally aimed at establishing strong ties between individuals.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/31058-1.png" alt="" style="width:286pt;height:82pt;">
<p><span class="font4">Figure 1. “face” according to Brown and Levinson (1987, p.68)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These to distinction of FTA may lead to do the FTA or not to do the FTA. The strategies of doing FTA depend on the circumstance whether the speaker wants to reserve the hearer face to any degree. In order to minimize the FTA, Brown &amp;&nbsp;Levinson (1987) presented an anlysis strategy which leads to the theory of linguistic politeness. The figure showed the linguistic politeness strategy by Brown and Levinson, especially in dealing with FTAs (Face Threatening Act).</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PEECH </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CTS</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Conceptually, Austin (1962) defines speech acts as an utterance uttered by the people which are not intended to state the information only. The utterance is also intended to perform actions. Austin influences three categories of speech act called locutionary, illocutionary and perlucotionary act. Based on the categories, Searle (1976) focuses on illocutionary act which divided into some types, namely: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Representative</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Directive</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Commisive</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Expressive</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Declarative</span><span class="font4">. Furthermore, Clark (2004) enlarges those five categories of illocutionary act of Searle into: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Representative</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Directive</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Need statement</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Imperative</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Embedded imperatives</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Premision derictives</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Question directives</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hint</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Commisive</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Expressive</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Effective</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Verdictive</span><span class="font4">. Thus, the focus of the research study is on the application of politeness in the hotel which cannot be separated from illocutionary act because it is as the action that performed in the utterance spoken in the guest service interaction.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The discussion section has been parted as two discussions based on the finding in order to answer the research question of this research.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3.1 &nbsp;T</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HE KINDS OF POLITENESS STRATEGIES USED BY TRAINER IN ROOM DIVISION DEPARTMENT</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">There were some politeness strategies employed by the trainer in room division department bapeppar Nusa Dua. The data collection was conducted by observing twenty trainers in room division department.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<p><span class="font4">Positive acts need of every member that his wants to be appreciated and accepted, to be treated as the member of the same group, and to know that his or her wants are shared by others. In everyday conversation, the trainers adapt conversation to different situations. For example showing awareness for another person’s face when that other seems socially distance is often described in term of respect and deference. There are some utterances by the trainer when they serve the guest on the job training.</span></p>

The utterance is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">There are many guests from Hongkong that leave in this Hotel. Hongkong is the best city for run the business</span><span class="font4">. That utterance was not the basic interaction for the guest’s information. That information was used for continuing his conversation so the guest was not stopping to talk something. The trainer tried to answer in freedom communication even though there was not really reasonable information.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HE IMPLICATION OF POLITENESS STRATEGIES USED BY TRAINER IN ROOM DIVISION</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DEPARTMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Politeness strategies have been given implication in their job training communication. There were some implications of using language in their interaction such as:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">EHAVIOR</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Respect behavior. The trainers have respect to their guest and the guest also should be respect to the trainers. Positive face used by the trainer fulfills the respect behavior in their interaction. In interaction the trainers used greeting, thanking and also taking leave expression. They express respect behavior in order to create good relationship between the trainer and the guest in communication. Good relationship make good interaction atmosphere in the process serving guest</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">OGETHERNESS</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Meanwhile, the trainer has togetherness. Togetherness is behavior that should be fulfilled in the process of serving guest in hotel beside respect. Togetherness could make the trainers have more motivation in the serving guest process. Togetherness is one aspect in order to create good relationship between guest and the trainer, it is similar with respect. Togetherness perform when teacher appraising students’ idea, answer or responses. The trainers try to create togetherness in order to motivate the students for example by using joke and solidarity in group identity markers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
