<p><span class="font2">The slang expression means coming to democratic atmosphere in language since the meaning embodied is not absolute. It depends upon who uses it, in which group the users belong to, and in what situation slang word occur. Having knowledge of slang, it means the user is bilingual, or even multilingual. The question emerged is how the user of slang employ slang in their daily communication. Their choice of certain slang replacing the standard may have a certain purposes. Therefore, it is really difficult to translate it in Indonesian. How to transfer the meaning of slang that contains senses about culture, habit, and identity of specific group of people is a complex undertaking. The form of English slang used in the novel &quot;The Adventure of Oliver Twist” by Charles Dickens is generally in the form of primary slang. There were sixteen primary slang words uttered by the character in the novel. However, there was only four secondary slang words found in the novel. So the primary slang more common used by the character in novel. There are three approaches that can be used to find the conceptual meaning of word in the process of translation. There are reference theory, componential analysis, and meaning postulate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ABSTRAK</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Kata Slang merupakan expresi demokratis dalam bahasa yang menganduk makna tidak mutlak. Itu tergantuk pada siapa yang menggunakannya, di lingkungan mana penggunanya tinggal, dan dalam situasi seperti apa kata slang itu digunankan. Pengguna slang biasanya bilingual atau bahkan multibahasa. Pertanyaan pun muncul bagaimana kata slang digunakan dalam komunikasi sehari-hari. Pengguna kata slang menggunakan slang untuk mengganti kata-kata standar yang biasa digunakan sehari-hari pastinya memiliki tujuan tertentu.Oleh karena itu sangat sulit untuk menerjemahkan kata slang bahasa Inggris ke bahasa Indonesia. Bagaimana process untuk mentransfer makna kata slang yang berisi tentang budaya, kebiasaan, dan identitas kelompok tertentu orang adalah suatu usaha yang kompleks. Bentuk bahasa slang dalam bahasa Inggris yang digunakan dalam novel &quot;The Adventure of Oliver Twist&quot; oleh Charles Dickens umumnya dalam bentuk kata slang primer. Ada enam belas kata slang utama yang diucapkan oleh karakter dalam novel, namun hanya ada empat kata slang sekunder yang ditemukan dalam novel. Jadi kata slang primer lebih umum digunakan oleh karakter dalam novel. Ada tiga pendekatan yang bisa digunakan untuk menganalisis kata slang dalam prosess penerjemahan. Ada teori referensi, analisis komponensial,dan makna leksikal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Keywords: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kata slang, teori referensi, analisis komponensial, dan makna leksikal.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>BACKGROUND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The contribution of slang in enriching language; a short of real representation of the dynamism of language and symbol of human freedom in creating language was a interesting phenomena to be analyzed (Hoey, 2005). The slang expression means coming to democratic atmosphere in language since the meaning embodied is not absolute. It depends upon who uses it, in which group the users belong to, and in what situation slang word occur. The question emerged is how the user of slang employ slang in their daily communication. Their choice of certain slang replacing the standard may have a certain purposes (Jones, 2009).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Upon the research of Adams, Eble and Dumas &amp;&nbsp;Lighter, bit is determined that slang is used with a special goal: to form groups, to rebel against standard language and to suggest informal settings. Introducing the theory of register, a scale of formality is introduced in order to show different settings in which communication take place (Halliday, 2004).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Slang seems to have suffered social stigma among linguists and lexicographers because it has frequently been associated with overtly impertinent behavior (Adams 2009: 32). In fact, finding sources to explain the function of slang is very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Therefore, it is really difficult to translate it in Indonesian. How to transfer the meaning of slang that contains senses about culture, habit, and identity of specific group of people is a complex undertaking (Abu Risha, 2008). Today, the English slang plays a major role in daily communication among the teenagers (Abu Syahdeh, 2004). The slang has been shaped and reshaped by different culture and the emergence of technology which become a phenomenon of the language development (Boase-Beier, 2004).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The problem related to the background can be formulated into two, as the following question: (1) What are kinds or types of English slang used in the novel entitled “The Adventure of Oliver Twist” by Charles Dickens? (2) How the three approaches of word meaning proposed by Bells can help the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">translator find three conceptual meaning of slang word in the novel “The Adventure of Oliver Twist” by Charles Dickens?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>REASEARCH METHOD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The research method of this study can be divided into three following aspect. They are: data source is taken from the novel entitled “The Adventure of Oliver Twist” by Charles Dickens, method and technique of collecting data of the study using documentation technique, and method and technique of analyzing data of this study using qualitative method to describe the kinds or the types, the characteristics and the technique to translate slang word into Indonesian.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>DISCUSSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Spolsky (2001) proposed that slang originally mean abuse. Slang is a kind of jargon marked by its rejection of formals rules, its comparative freshness, and its common ephemerality, and its marked use to claim solidarity. Slang is the language that has a little to do with the main aim of language, the connection of sound with ideas in order to communicate each idea, but rather an attitude, a felling and an act. Based on the international journal entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Whassup? Slang and Swearing among School Children</span><span class="font2"> by Aitchison (2007, vol. 19, no.2); the writer points out that slang is often simply new, lively language, thought needs to be carefully, especially in written language. Swearing has always existed, and is inappropriate in formal setting. Confusion has arisen in relation to both type of language, because of the general growth of informality in the modern–day world. Slang words enter the language ever faster, and swearing is sometimes felt to be useful way to avoid pomposity (Williams, 2004).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nida and Taber (1974) state that translating consist in reproducing in the receptor language the closest natural equivalent of the source language massage, first in term of meaning and secondly in term of style. In relation in his notion of translation, they further add that translation must aim primarily at “producing massage”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Conceptual Meaning</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Bell (1991) proposed conceptual meaning sometimes called ’denotative meaning or ‘cognitive’ meaning) is widely assumed to be the central factor in verbal communication and it can be shown to be integral to the essential functioning of language in a way that other types of meaning are not. Much of the conceptual meaning of translation can be found in the dictionary</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>The Characteristic of Slang</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">One remarkable characteristic of slang is the creation of a large number of different word for the same thing, like babe, baby cakes, sweetie-pei, for a sweat heart; or kooky, schizo, loco for crazy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another feature of slang is extremely large mortality of slang terms in their infancy. It is due to the younger generation drop them out. Whereas, many of slang past to colloquialism and many of it on to standard speech. The other characteristic of slang can be found in spoken and written language (Boase-Beier, 2006).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since slang is not considered as standard, formal or acceptable under all condition, slang is usually vulgar, impolite, or boorish. However, the vast majority of slang word and expression are neither taboo, vulgar, derogatory, nor offensive in meaning, sound or image (</span><span class="font0">Zanettin, 2008)</span><span class="font2">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The other characteristic of slang is the medium of slang to be represented. Most slang is found in spoken language rather than written language.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>The Reason of the Use Of Slang</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">According to Eric Partridge (1894-1979), people use slang for any of at least 15 reason:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Fun: speaker use slang in order to achieve an exhilaration of the moment and ice breaker of formality to be an intimate relationship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Exercise in Wit or Ingenuity or in Humor: understanding that slang is dealing with the innovative creation in language, speaker is challenged to be active to play with the existing word to generate as many as slang that they can do. e.g. – a mouthpiece for (‘a lawyer’).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Difference: speaker uses slang as an identity embodied for their group in purposing to make them different from others characterized by the language that use. Due to slang is used to show other (and to remind ourselves of) our biographical, mental, and psychological background; to show our social, economic, geographical, national, racial, religious, educational, occupational, and group interest, membership, and patriotism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Picturesque: to convey a massage to hearer, speaker desire to represent it in unusual way in order to prevent them from insipidity. The picturesque or metaphorical aspect of slang is often due to its direct honesty or to its newness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Arresting: slang is used in order to give an impact or even shocking the hearer so that they will give more attention to the word uttered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Escape from Clichés: slang is usually simple and overt rather than complex or subtle. The ability of slang in this part is to avoid repetition and long explanation produced by the existing word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Enriching the Language: a slang term can reveal the full creative potentially of language. There many new word coming up to the standard when on the first stage, it was slang. The need of slang, sometimes, because there is no one standard word to use. It could be said that slang are result from specific situation in which new object, ideas, or happening require new word to describe them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Adding Concrete: slang has ability to bring the abstract with concrete, the idealistic with realism and earthiness, the remote with aptness and immediacy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Secret: slang is used to avoid being understood by one’s companion or the standers-by. Most of this slang are known as criminal terms and used by the underworld people. The example of them are: e.g. – pie wagon (‘police patrol wagon’), -sneeze (‘arrest’), -snow (‘cocaine’),- black stuff (‘opium’).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For excluding the others: slang is used as a proving to determine that someone does not belong</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">to speaker’s group by testing of understanding language that they use.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For showing that one belongs: slang is used to establish relationship among the people in the same group by proving the understanding the language that they use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For intimacy: speaker uses slang in order to promote a deep or lasting friendliness. This case can be clearly seen when someone start to open conversation on the first time they meet. Slang is used as a open ice-breaker among them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ease or social interaction: slang is used to maintain the relationship among speaker and hearer by entertaining and amusing them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For being colloquial: slang is used as a device to run away from the formal atmosphere resulting a distance from hearer. Slang tends to create a informality and familiarity situation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For reducing seriousness: slang is uttered to alleviate starkness and soften the tragedy. Due to its ingenious and amusing word delivered</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Three Approach of Word Meaning</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Among the possible ways of approaching the description and explanation of word meaning, three-stand out as particularly interesting: (1) reference theory (which would express the relationship between word and entity in some terms such as 'word X refer to entity Y); (2) componential analysis ( which would make use of an analogy from chemistry -'each word contain a number of atom of meaning'); and (3) meaning postulate (which would relate meaning to meaning through the convention of set theory -'a tiger isa mammal, isa animal, i.e. ' a tiger is a kind of mammal and mammal is kind of animal or animal include mammal, include tiger: {{{tiger} mammal} animal}.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Reference Theory</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Investigations into how language interacts with the world are called theories of reference. This theory divided the semantic content of every expression, including sentences, into two components:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">sense and meaning (&quot;denotation&quot;, &quot;nominatum&quot; and &quot;reference&quot;, among others). The sense of a sentence is the thought that it expresses. Such a thought is abstract, universal and objective. The sense of any sub-sentential expression consists in its contribution to the thought that its embedding sentence expresses. Senses determine reference and are also the modes of presentation of the objects to which expressions refer. Referents are the objects in the world that words pick out. Hence, the referents of &quot;the evening star&quot; and &quot;the morning star&quot; are the same, the planet Venus. But they are two different modes of presenting the same object and hence they </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Componential Analysis</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Componential analysis, also called feature analysis or contrast analysis, refers to the description of the meaning of words through structured sets of semantic features, which are given as “present”, “absent” or “indifferent with reference to feature”. The method thus departs from the principle of compositionality. Componential analysis is a method typical of structural semantics which analyzes the structure of a word's meaning. Thus, it reveals the culturally important features by which speakers of the language distinguish different words in the domain (Ottenheimer, 2006, p. 20). This is a highly valuable approach to learning another language and understanding a specific semantic domain of Ethnography.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Structural semantics and the componential analysis were patterned on the phonological methods of the Prague School, which described sounds by determining the absence and presence of features. On one hand, componential analysis gave birth to various models in generative semantics, lexical field theory and transformational grammar. On the other hand, its shortcoming was also visible:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery procedures for semantic features are not clearly objectifiable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only part of the vocabulary can be described through more or less structured sets of features.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metalinguistic features are expressed through language again.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Features used may not have clear definitions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited in focus and mechanical in style.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">As a consequence, entirely different ways to describe meaning were developed, such as prototype semantics.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Meaning Postulate</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In semantics, a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">meaning postulate </span><span class="font2">is the notion that lexical items (words) can be defined in terms of relations with other lexical items. Meaning postulates can put constraints on the interrelations that must hold among the meanings of certain words without necessarily treating one word as “more basic” than another or decomposing both of them into some common “atoms”. Decompositional analyses are not forbidden but are not required; that issue can be open to exploration and debate. The representation of argument structure illustrated here is exceedingly primitive and not to be taken seriously. The point of such an example is just to show that one can write axioms concerning the relation of pairs like buy and sell without trying to represent them as the “same relation” on any level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Montague included a number of meaning postulates in PTQ (Montague 1973); many of them concerned issues of intensionality in various subclasses of verbs, nouns, and prepositions. The type of seek makes its direct object position referentially opaque; this meaning postulate puts mutual constraints on the meanings of seek, try, and find. If one believes that the meaning of seek includes but is not fully identical to the meaning of try to find, one can replace the x in this meaning postulate by y . Various semantic subclasses within a given semantic type. Whether such meaning postulates are possible for more than a small fraction of the lexicon of a natural language is a matter of debate which we do not aim to settle.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Example and Explanation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">As stated by Chapman (1988) there are two kinds of slang; the primary slang and secondary slang, primary slang is the pristine speech of subculture members; so very natural to its speaker that it seems they might be mute without it; then secondary slang deals with the stylistic choice rather than true identification.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary Slang</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">From the conversation and the language spoken by the character in the novel The Adventure of Oliver Twist, found that there were some of English slang can identified into primary slang. They are can be found as in the following sentence:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">wanna</span><span class="font2"> a product of to my environment; I </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">wanna</span><span class="font2"> my environment to be a product of me.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank, you </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gotta</span><span class="font2"> see somebody.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3.</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeez,</span><span class="font2"> she fell funny.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, I got twenty thousand </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bucks</span><span class="font2"> when my mother died.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy your clams, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cocksuckers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need you to keep your eyes open up, no more </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bull shit.</span><span class="font2"> Too bad. Your mother worked all </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">goddamned</span><span class="font2"> day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They think fucking that project is the best, I’m sure that you will </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bloody fucking die</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about us, Frank? What're w</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">e </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gonna</span><span class="font2"> do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">9.</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothin', nothin'.</span><span class="font2"> It doesn't have any power, that's all. It just happened once.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you don’t find the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cheesy rat bastard</span><span class="font2"> on your department, most likely not me who suffering.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">All of the above slang expression uttered by the actor in the movie” The Departed” when they communicated each other were identified as Primary slang because as stated by Chapman (1988), primary slang were general expression used by English people on their daily communication and those slang expression were generally used as a expression to talk each other in their daily life. For example, the word “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">wanna”</span><span class="font2"> as found data no.1, this kind of slang word is referring to or indicating an action of someone desire. The word “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">wanna”</span><span class="font2"> has the same</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">meaning of the formal form (want to). So this kind of slang is clearly shown what the speaker said to indicating something they wanted to do.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary Slang</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In the novel “The Adventure of Oliver Twist” found some secondary slang. Based on Chapman theory secondary slang is kind of slang word that deals with the stylistic choice rather than true identification. Secondary slang in the movie script “The Departed” can be identified as in the following sentences:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think Costello got </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rats</span><span class="font2"> on State Police.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2.</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except sell the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ching chongs</span><span class="font2"> a bunch of fuckin' plastic.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want some </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">coke</span><span class="font2">? There it is. Don’t move till you numb.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check your weapons... Fitzy has the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chicken…</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Analysis:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slang word “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rats”</span><span class="font2"> in the data no 1 used to call unpleasant person or a person who is no loyal or who deceives. It common used to express someone’s attitude. It is the reason why the slang word “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rats”</span><span class="font2"> classify as secondary slang.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slang word “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ching chong”</span><span class="font2"> in the data no 2 is words that common used to call the Chinese man. This kind of slang usually used by the drugs dealers or street gangs to call the Chinese man. So this kind of slang is one of stylistic choice to express resourcefulness of something. It is the reason why the slang word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ching chong </span><span class="font2">classify as secondary slang.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slang word “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">coke”</span><span class="font2"> in the data no 3 is common used to name cocaine. This slang word is used to express something in secret way where just restricted people who understand the meaning of that words. It is the reason why the slang word “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">coke” </span><span class="font2">classifies as secondary slang.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slang word “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chicken”</span><span class="font2"> in data no 4 is common used to called a girl, young woman, and also a word that used to called people who afraid to do something. In this case “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chicken”</span><span class="font2"> is used to express someone’s attitude. It is the reason why the slang word “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chicken”</span><span class="font2"> classify as secondary slang.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Componential Analysis</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Componential analysis, also called feature analysis or contrast analysis, refers to the description of the meaning of words through structured sets of semantic features, which are given as “present”, “absent” or “indifferent with reference to feature”. The method thus departs from the principle of compositionality. Componential analysis is a method typical of structural semantics which analyzes the structure of a word's meaning. Thus, it reveals the culturally important features by which speakers of the language distinguish different words in the domain (Ottenheimer, 2006, p. 20). This is a highly valuable approach to learning another language and understanding a specific semantic domain of Ethnography.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Structural semantics and the componential analysis were patterned on the phonological methods of the Prague School, which described sounds by determining the absence and presence of features. On one hand, componential analysis gave birth to various models in generative semantics, lexical field theory and transformational grammar. On the other hand, its shortcoming was also visible:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery procedures for semantic features are not clearly objectifiable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only part of the vocabulary can be described through more or less structured sets of features.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metalinguistic features are expressed through language again.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Features used may not have clear definitions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited in focus and mechanical in style.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">As a consequence, entirely different ways to describe meaning were developed, such as prototype semantics.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Meaning Postulate</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In semantics, a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">meaning postulate </span><span class="font2">is the notion that lexical items (words) can be defined in terms of relations with other lexical items. Meaning postulates can put constraints on the interrelations that must hold among the meanings of certain words without necessarily treating one word as “more</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">basic” than another or decomposing both of them into some common “atoms”. Decompositional analyses are not forbidden but are not required; that issue can be open to exploration and debate. The representation of argument structure illustrated here is exceedingly primitive and not to be taken seriously. The point of such an example is just to show that one can write axioms concerning the relation of pairs like buy and sell without trying to represent them as the “same relation” on any level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Montague included a number of meaning postulates in PTQ (Montague 1973); many of them concerned issues of intensionality in various subclasses of verbs, nouns, and prepositions. The type of seek makes its direct object position referentially opaque; this meaning postulate puts mutual constraints on the meanings of seek, try, and find. If one believes that the meaning of seek includes but is not fully identical to the meaning of try to find, one can replace the x in this meaning postulate by y . Various semantic subclasses within a given semantic type. Whether such meaning postulates are possible for more than a small fraction of the lexicon of a natural language is a matter of debate which we do not aim to settle.</span></p>
