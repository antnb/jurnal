ABSTRACT The storage temperature of the methamphetamine samples has significantly influenced the analysis results of the samples using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Optimization of the storage temperature for analysis of the methamphetamine and its metabolites by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy has been done aiming to compare the level of methamphetamine compound in different urine samples. Normal urine samples"
  - "normal urine samples added with methamphetamine"
  - "and urine samples of the methamphetamine users were each collected as much as 60 mL. The result of the methamphetamine-screening test showed that the normal urine samples were negative but the normal urine samples added with methamphetamine and urine samples of the methamphetamine users were positive. Each sample was then divided into three groups for direct analysis and stored at 4 and 25 oC for 14 days. The methamphetamine analysis using gas chromatography showed that the chromatogram of the normal urine samples did not show any absorption of methamphetamine or its metabolites. Still"

  - "the chromatogram of the normal urine added with methamphetamine and the urine samples of the methamphetamine users indicated the peak of methamphetamine compound detected at Rt 5.27-5.28"
  - "however"
  - "the amphetamine (methamphetamineâ€™s metabolite) peak was only detected at the chromatogram of the urine samples of the methamphetamine user"
  - "which was at Rt 5.07-5.08. The data of the gas chromatography analysis were supported by the fraction of m/z 44"

  - "dan 120 were typical fractions of amphetamine. The results showed that the temperature of 4 oC was the optimum temperature for storing urine samples of methamphetamine users because there was no significant decrease in methamphetamine levels. Keywords: Amphetamine"
