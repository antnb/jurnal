<p><span class="font1">The change of government from “The New Order” to “The Reformation Order” has also been followed by the change of administration system from centralization to decentralization system. Along with that change, the authority and institution of family planning program have also been transferred to the regency or city government. These changes have risen various perceptions in term of the institutional, roles, and functions of that institute. Other important changes include that (1) the family planning coordination board organization on regency level did not change but the echelon was decreased; or (2) the family planning coordination board organization on regency level was merged to other institution; or (3) the family planning coordination board activity on regency level is only a little part of the other instance. All of those changes have caused some problems of coordination from family planning coordination board on province level to regency level, and it has given a negative impact to the family planning program achievement.</span></p>
