Music video clip is one of the examples of entertainment where we can enjoy it by seeing and listening. Musicians especially the singers apply this technology to transmit the meaning of their songs, however, they do not just deliver a message in their songs with video but</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">rather to prioritize how these songs make the audience understand the meaning of those songs without having seen or reading the lyrics of those songs.</span></p>
