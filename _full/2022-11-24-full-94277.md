</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract*</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">This study aims to analyze and provide examples of paraphrasing a sentence contained in an article, this article is entitled about the influence of COVID-19 in the world of education and the economy in Indonesia. The article that we take as an example is an article written by our friend. Paraphrases can not only be used in speeches, dialogues, songs of daily life and other literary works, but paraphrases can also be used in a scientific work, for example, in articles, mini-research thesis and others. Therefore, the researcher is very interested in paraphrasing this scientific work, namely the article. This researcher uses a qualitative method, by collecting data, then the researcher paraphrases the sentences that can be paraphrased according to the researcher. then the data is taken and collected, then analyzed with the theory contained in the paraphrase, so it really supports this research. Paraphrasing is the restating of a sentence such that both sentences would generally be recognized as lexically and syntactically different while remaining semantically equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in this case in the form of quotations which are mostly the contents of our writings, show our limitations in reformulating the meaning of the sentence and changing the grammatical arrangement of the sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The limitations of reformulating the meaning content and changing the structure of the judgment encourage the pen to unfold strategies and rephrasing ways. A study stated that producing jottings with all the coherent and interrelated description information grounded on colorful textbooks really demanded a wisdom metamorphosis strategy( Björk, Bräuer, Rienecker, &amp;&nbsp;Jörgensen, 2003; Mateos etal., 2011). This strategy model really makes pens as newcomers relatively grueling, especially if they don't have standard capabilities or aren't oriented to using knowledge metamorphosis strategies( Hyytinen,H., Löfström,E., &amp;&nbsp;Lindblom- Ylänne,S.( 2017). In addition to metamorphosis knowledge as a strategy of conveying meaning, rephrasing which plays a part in regulating the fashion of conveying meaning with different words according to Paradis( 2007,p. 17) shows parallels to restatement, which at leastre-expresses meaning with different words. Jakobson( 1959) himself reveals that rephrasing as an intralingual restatement/ restating model is used to convey dispatches of meaning with different tract( word combinations) expressions. This is also frequently used for restatement grounded on hypotheticals which are frequently analogous to the process of verbal discipline without an interlingual element( Moser, 1983; Russo &amp;&nbsp;Salvador, 2004; Whyatt, Stachowiak, &amp;&nbsp;Kajzer Wietrzny, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Paraphrase in addition to functioning to express the meaning in which different editorial words are manifested from the original sentences, paraphrase plays a role in helping the reader understand the pillars of the paragraph which has the same function as drawing conclusions. Paraphrasing requires the reader to identify the main idea in the paragraph and rephrase it in their own words to translate the whole main idea contained in the text, so that the reader can be helped to understand the text by being taught via paraphrasing before or along with drawing conclusions at the end of the reading (Watson et al. , 2012). A study on paraphrasing for students who have difficulty understanding text that the impact of the strategy on improving reading comprehension is due to TRAP (Think before reading the text, Read a paragraph, Ask yourself, “What is most of this paragraph talking about?” and Change to restate it. in their own words) with SRSD as a developmental strategy model that encourages students to be able to regulate themselves in involvement in an activity and the entire process in it (Hagaman, J.L., Casey, K.J., &amp;&nbsp;Reid, R., 2016). The contribution of paraphrase is very significant in helping the reader understand the reading text (Erhel &amp;&nbsp;Jamet, 2006) and demonstrate the ability to interpret the meaning of the sentence (Russo &amp;&nbsp;Pippa).</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Paraphrase is disclosure of information in another form but does not change themeaning or initial understanding. Paraphrasing is a form of reformulating a grammar, sentence or pronunciation by using a simpler diction without changing the meaning of the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Paraphrase is born from the Latin &quot;paraphrase&quot; and the Greek (Paraphrasein) both of which have the meaning of &quot;additional way of expressing&quot;. It can be interpreted that paraphrasing is a form of reformulating a grammar, sentence or pronunciation by using simpler diction without changing the meaning of the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In general, the technique of writing paraphrase is often used by writers to avoid plagiarism by providing indirect quotes from the original text. What the author did by using the paraphrasing technique is something that is not against the law as the author is only rewriting the idea in his own sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this study, we as researchers used a qualitative method. Qualitative method also examines something in depth to get a new conclusion. Qualitative method is more suitable to be used in this study because researchers are looking for the sentential meaning about paraprhase in a article about &quot;The impact of COVID-19 on the world of education and the economy of Indonesia&quot;. Researchers chose this article because the researchers think this article is easy to understand and has many standard figurative words for making it easier to paraphrase. In this article, we as researchers find that, there are several can be the example of paraprhase. Researchers collected data based on the article taken from the browser and we make questioners in our Article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After that the researcher wrote, then the researcher analyzed this article that we had chosen, after that categorizing the words that have paraprhase, then the researcher explained the words in the article related to the paraprhase of the word. Based on the explanation above, the researcher found the problem of the study, it is &quot;&nbsp;How to analyze the sentential meaning (paraphrase) in the article about the impact of COVID-19 on the world of education and the economy of Indonesia &quot;?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding and Discussion</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Paraphrase is a linguistic term that means relying on a concept in another way in the same language, but without changing its meaning. If paraphrasing poetry means changing poetry into prose form that is subject to the rules of prose without changing the content of the poem (Ayulinda, 2009). According to the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary paraphrase is a way of expressing what has been written and said by other people by using different words in order to be made easier for Hal or in other words quoting done in paraphrasing quotes using own words to express the same idea, or used to maintain coherence and the integrity of the flow of writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">-paraphrasing elements, namely</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paraphrasing a sentence means to separate or chopping a sentence into several words according to the position, namely subject, predicate, object, and description;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paraphrasing the syllable meaning separate or chop off a word according to its syllables;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paraphrase poetry turns poetry into prose or narrative form.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Paraphrase is to the sentence what synonymy is to words. This means that the paraphrase explains a situation in which two or more sentences have one meaning. Indeed, a sentence can have many paraphrases. There are two types of paraphrases: lexical and structural paraphrases. In lexical paraphrases, we have two or more sentences giving the same interpretation as a result of the replacement of one word or phrase by another. The examples:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">⋅ </span><span class="font4">The chef hired a bachelor</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">⋅ </span><span class="font4">The chef hired an unmarried man</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the two sentences above, the change in their structure is as a result of the substitution of a bachelor for an unmarried man. Both a bachelor and unmarried man are phrases. Consider further the following sentences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">⋅ &nbsp;</span><span class="font4">The man was agitated</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">⋅ &nbsp;</span><span class="font4">The man was anxious</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have achieved the paraphrase by the substitution of the word “agitated” for another, “anxious.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Structural paraphrase is achieved when we alter the arrangements of the sentences through transformations. The following are examples:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">•</span><span class="font4"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They bought a new apartment (Basic –subject + Verb+ object)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">In this article we take one of example about pharaprase in the article with title “The impact of COVID-19 in education” so, the disruption of the learning process due to the pandemic outbreak can cause a decline in the quality of human resources in the future, both in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">cognitive, affective and conative aspects. For this reason, efforts are needed from various parties, especially the government so that the learning process can run effectively even in the midst of the covid 19 pandemic. The process of teaching and learning activities must continue and students do not lose their right to learn. Schools as educational institutions must respond quickly to the phenomenon of the COVID-19 outbreak by always trying so that the learning process can be carried out effectively. The school as a whole is a medium of interaction between students and teachers to improve their intelligence, skills and affection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Miriam Webster's dictionary paraphrasing is a restatement of text, passage, or work that gives meaning in another form. Thus the process of paraphrasing is studying or teaching the composition of a part of a text, or a work that is rewritten in a different form. Furthermore, paraphrasing is a way of expressing that is written by someone else, and rewritten by someone with different words and is easier to understand. Paraphrasing requires readers to identify the main idea in the paragraph and rearrange it with their own words to translate the overall main idea contained in the text, so that readers can be helped to understand the text by teaching it through paraphrasing before or along with concluding at the end of the reading. The impact of the paraphrasing strategy can improve reading comprehension because reading for oneself encourages writers to self-regulate in engaging in a reading activity. The contribution of paraphrasing is very significant in helping readers understand the reading text and demonstrate the ability to interpret the meaning of sentence</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example of paraprhase in article ihe impact of COVID-19 in education .</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">•</span><span class="font4"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is that the government must pay more attention to the field of education, such as providing or covering all internet quotas for students due to declining economic in come</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">So the paraphrase from that’s sentence is : The solution is that the government needs to pay more attention to this Education areas, such as providing or covering all internet quotas Students fell due to operating income</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And the others sentence from that’s article is</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">•</span><span class="font4"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economy is the most important factor in human life. Economic needs are closely related to everyday life. Humans to meet their needs such as eating, drinking, clothing, shelter and others require a strong economy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">So the paraphrase: Economy is the most important factor in human life. economic need closely related to daily life. People need a strong economy to meet their needs such as food, drink, clothing, shelter, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based explanation above there are several things that the author discusses here, namely education in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. The system of higher education consists of a number of interrelated elements, such as people, places, physical technology, social technology, desires and ideas, disasters, and personalities. The impact of COVID-19 on the education system will result in changes to the pre-covid-19 system, which in turn will create a series of interconnected reactions by other elements until the system reaches a new balance. In this article, we consider several possible changes to the education system, however many questions left. This discussion highlights how they will become more critical as those with higher education respond to the many challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has created. Higher accountability structures, the education system builds on these basic norms, and provides the flexibility needed to adequately respond to the crisis. Higher and more critical, education must be trusted to do what is right in difficult times. Higher education will compete for financial support from governments and donors, will need assurances that students receive an equal education regardless of delivery method, will have to persuade students to apply despite current uncertainties, and convince students, families and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">communities that they can still be trusted to act. Moreover, budget cuts, shifts to online modalities, and late entry to college are all risks to higher education's social equity role. Institutions should be aware of this as they consider how they will react during this adjustment period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So,in this article the author found that the problem of education during the education period was very influential, in this case teachers and students had to adapt back to new systems such as learning e-learning, zoom meetings and only listening to the knowledge taught by the teacher was only limited to sending material through whatsaap groups and students are required to study the material that has been given so that it makes students lazy and bored with things like that, therefore now that face-to-face schools are holding students become more enthusiastic when studying directly at school, therefore the online system can also be applied to provides an option when the teacher is briefing outside the city which requires the teacher to provide learning material through a zoom meeting or simply provide material through a whatsapp group.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Paraphrase is a sentence or phrase that conveys the same meaning by using different words.Although the logical definition of paraphrase requires strict semantic equivalence, linguistics accepts broader, approximate, equivalence — thus allowing more examples. Paraphrase comes from the Greek which means additional way of expressing. In linguistics, paraphrasing is retelling a concept in another way in the same language but not changing its meaning. According to the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, paraphrasing is a way of expressing what has been written.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a) Characteristics of Paraphrasing</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Paraphrase has characteristics that are closely related to its meaning, these characters help someone or the writer to more easily understand paraphrasing. In addition, the existing characteristics also make it easier for writers to identify paraphrases, here are some characteristics of online paraphrasing in Indonesian.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;</span><span class="font4">Ways and forms of presenting sentences using different words such as online</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">paraphrasing.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though they are presented using different words, they still have the same meaning or substance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substance conveyed does not change at all even though it is presented in different words.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of paraphrasing are delivered more communicatively and not easily understood by readers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delivery language used is lighter to make it easier for the reader.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">In turns out, there are paraphrasing guide has, it has four steps:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read the text carefully several times until you understand it completely.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look for words that are not understood by finding synonym for them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;write a brief outline including the main idea (topic and idea control), main supporting points, and primary and secondary supporting details.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;write paraphrases using different vocabulary and sentences.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Paraphrasing is an effort to simplify writing to make it simpler and easier for readers to source information in easy language so that it can be understood by many people. The consequence of paraphrasing is relevance by using the technique of paraphrasing ideas and ideas can be politely conveyed even in meeting, conversation, or presentation activities.</span></p>
