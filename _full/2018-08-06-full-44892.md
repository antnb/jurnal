<p><span class="font5">1930 is a milestone in the development of tourism in Bali, with the establishment of Inna Bali Hotel, a colonialstyle architectural building to accommodate the increasing tourists coming at that time. World War II in 1942-1945 had an impact in pausing tourist arrivals to Bali, but the next decade, tourist dwellings growing very rapidly. Sanur, Kuta, Ubud, flooded with tourists up until now Bali has 35,000 residential tours. The number of tourists attracted to come to Bali because of its cultural uniqueness made local Government developed tourism industry based on cultural tourism policy. This policy is outlined in Local Regulation No. 3 of 1974, which was revised into Local Regulation No. 3 of 1991 on Cultural Tourism, which states that every tourism industrialization of this region must be based on Balinese culture. It is what fosters the idea and creativity of the Puri Agung Kerambitan leader in Bali to make his palace as part of the tourism culture in Bali.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESEARCH METHOD</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">A population is a group of people, objects or things that are the source of sampling, a set that meets certain requirements related to research problems. The population was taken based on written data of Puri Agung Kerambitan income from tourism activities which is divided into three major activities. The first, Puri Agung Kerambitan has Puri Wedding tourism attractions divided into three (3) levels namely Puri Wedding Alit, Puri Wedding Madya and Puri Wedding Agung with some activities such as Balinese bridal decoration, Baleganjur percussion, Okokan percussion, Pendet dance, Mask dance, Sekehe Kendang Mungkung dance.

Puri Day contains short learning activities on Balinese dance, Joged Bumbung dance attractions, traditional Balinese </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">jajanan</span><span class="font5"> making lessons, egg painting, kite making and short historical introductions to the palace. The third big event is packed in the form of Puri Dinner that invites tourists to enjoy dinner while watching some Balinese dance performances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The population was also taken by written data from the Puri Agung Kerambitan expenditure for the management of Puri regarding physical and non-physical. Physical aspects include the cost of environmental treatments in this case crops and buildings, spending on the treatment of the castle, the cost of electricity, water and the salary costs of the palace’s employees. While concerning non-physical expenses cost of the castle includes daily, weekly, monthly ceremony and big ceremony or ceremony every seven months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing the grand amount of the population, it is necessary to have a sample.

<p><span class="font5">III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">In the four visits to Puri Agung Kerambitan which the researcher drafted in the proposal, three visits have been conducted on August 15, September 4 and September 18, 2017. The first visit on August 15, 2017, was a survey of research sites and permits and were welcomed by the palace residents as well as the palace tourism manager. On the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">second and third visit on September 4th and 18th September 2017, the researchers used to find data of expenditure and income of tourism in Puri Agung Kerambitan. The data obtained y the technique of interviewing informants, palace managers and employees. It was difficult to get very accurate data with just two arrivals. Due to the changing in management structure and the absence of written data of daily / monthly expenditures of Puri Agung Kerambitan, the data of this research depends on the memories and experiences of the palace members that the researchers combine to get the results that the researcher feels quite appropriate and match with each data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Puri Agung Kerambitan, Tabanan has three tourism packages. The first is Puri Day with the price of Rp. 150,000 to Rp. 200,000 per person depending on the number of guests coming. In the activities of Puri Day, tourists can enjoy the original charm of Balinese Pendet dance as well as interact directly with Balinese dancers in Joged Bungbung. Interesting activities such as traditional Tejog game and tug of war, Balinese offerings making up to kites making can be followed by tourists. Lunch and tour around the castle became an interesting and anticipated part of this Puri Day package. Minimum order for this Puri Day activities is 20 people with the price of Rp. 200,000 per person. Lowest price Rp. 150,000 can be obtained if the tourists booked as many as 126 to 200 people maximum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to Puri Day, the package also offered is Puri Wedding. The package is divided into three categories: Puri Wedding Alit, Puri Wedding Madya and Puri Wedding Agung, tailored to the wishes and capabilities of each traveler's cost. Starting from the price of Rp. 10.000.000 nett, this package offers a traditional Balinese wedding procession experience with a touch of the castle. Starting from the bridal couple who is accompanied by the family of the castle with all the equipment of ceremony such as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">banten</span><span class="font5">, spear and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">tedung</span><span class="font5">; Mask dances and Pendet dance accompany the bride to the temple of the castle; from wedding procession of the bride until dinner will be accompanied by Jogged Bungbung dance enliven the choice of tourists in this Puri Wedding package. The difference of Puri Wedding Alit, the package of Puri Wedding Madya worth Rp. 12.000.000 and Puri Wedding Agung with a value of Rp 17.000.000 lies in the many types of dances that accompany the wedding ceremony process, the dance as part of entertainment while enjoying dinner, and the use of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">joli</span><span class="font5"> or bridal stretcher that is only obtained by ordering Puri Wedding Agung. This </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">joli</span><span class="font5"> is proven to add tourists to enhance their package to Puri Wedding Agung. Not only tourists, the community around even outside the castle wanted to rent this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">joli</span><span class="font5"> several times for the benefit of their ceremonial procession. Surely the castle was not easy to grant permission, although the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">joli</span><span class="font5"> is indeed reserved for the show only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the procession of the ceremony felt too exhausting, but they still want to enjoy the atmosphere of the castle at night time complete with dance and dinner, Puri Agung Kerambitan has other options. Puri Night Dinner can be</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">selected by tourists. The price is very low for the size of foreign tourists. With Rp. 270,000 to Rp. 400,000 per person, art attractions such as Okokan, Pendet dance, Mask dance until dinner can be enjoyed by tourists. Do not forget the Calonarang drama dance can be a show that will not be easily forgotten by tourists and will continue to remember even on their way home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are two tables that will show the results of this study. The first table is the income table of Puri Agung Kerambitan which starts from January 2016 to December 2016. In this table, the arrival date of the guests in detail is ignored and entered into one data in one month. As an example of January, there are two arrivals on January 12 and January 19 as many as 20 guests each. In the table, the two arrival dates are ignored and put together into the guest's arrival within a month of a total of 40 guests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Similarly, in the months running and in the second table, the data table expenditure, researchers apply the same system. Due to the requirements of maximum pages on the article, the data shown in all tables is limited only on four months: January, March, September, and December.

<p><span class="font5">The results of research data are data of general spending Puri Agung Kerambitan. These data were divided into two categories: physical and non-physical aspects of expenses. Physical expenses, the division is the expenses for the maintenance of the palace, such as renovating and maintenance of Kori Agung, electricity bills and water bills, and the salaries of permanent and freelance employees, the center money combined with the mandatory fee of the castle members each month. This physical expenses also includes donations for two Tunini/grandmother who are still actively present at the castle of 5 Tunini who once existed in Puri Agung Kerambitan. Tuayah contribution was still part of the physical expenditure of this castle though Tuayah has long passed away. This became a permanent expenditure for the tourism castle since the tourism castle existed because of the services Tuayah/Late A.A. Ngurah Anom Mayun formed since the first time in 1980.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the category of non-physical expenditure, divided into ceremonial expenditure. Expenses for daily ceremonies; weekly or monthly ceremonies such as full moon ceremony, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kajeng Kliwon, Tilem, Anggara Kasih</span><span class="font5">; and big or annual ceremonies such as Nyepi, Galungan, and Kuningan. Provision of compensation funds like condolences or sickness, researchers also categorized as a form of non-physical expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Simply put, Puri Wisata's income data as in the following statistics:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSION</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Good and successful data, by the title of this research, shows that this activity can ease the number of maintenance costs incurred by the castle everyday even up to the cost of great maintenance and management such as Galungan ceremony, renovating Kori Agung. From income data in one year as much as Rp.234.875.000 and expenses also in one year as much as Rp.144.363.000, Puri Agung Kerambitan get gross profit Rp.90.512.000. The amount is not small for the annual income, but it is less if we see it from the scale of tourism activities that can be taken by this palace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By showing the data and the results of this research to the palace managers, it allows them to deeply analyze the tourism activities that have become the symbol of Puri Agung Kerambitan and the pride of local villagers. Further action in advance to develop the tourism in Puri Agung Kerambitan can be done, and the management of the palace’s tourism can be addressed. With the development of generations in Puri Agung, the selection of actions and activities of tourism can certainly be more varied. This can</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">From the above data, it is clear that the income of Puri Wisata in one the year 2016 as much as Rp.234.875.000 with the highest income in September of Rp.77.000.000</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">from Puri Day activities. Expenditure of Puri Wisata during the same period as much as Rp.144.363.000 with the highest expenditure also in September amounted to Rp.20.430.000 at an annual/large ceremony, because in this month Hindu celebrate Hari Raya Galungan and Kuningan which of course require cost much more to the size of the castle. From the difference between the income and expenditure of Puri Wisata, we can see the profit income of Rp.90.512.000 in 2016.</span></p>
