Aluminum Al contained in materials such as clay kaolin is one of the elements that play an important role in the ceramic body Al binds to other atoms like Si quartz to form a ceramic frame that is strong and not easily cracked In addition the bond with the group OH plays an important role in relation to the ability of ceramics to absorb water In this study BL1 type ceramic samples have been made with five variations of the burning temperature between 80
