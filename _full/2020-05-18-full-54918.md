<p><span class="font9">This study aims to explore the business strategy of Pesan Antar and present its business model by referring to the economic sharing model between Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The analysis of this study uses the ethnometodology method. The findings of this study are Pesan Antar has done a branding strategy before business activities begin. The strategy to maintain the loyalty of the courier, Pesan Antar applies a profit sharing and bonus mechanism, also implementing family culture to run business. Strategy to maintain business growth, Pesan Antar introducing other MSME products (though not yet a partner) no &quot;fees&quot; become a partner. To maintain customer loyalty, Pesan Antar strategy are “the rate” charged to customers is per region and order system using social media (not an application). Pesan Antar match with Type I economic models sharing among MSMEs Choi et al. (2014).</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Salim &amp;&nbsp;Ihalauw (2017), explain that Gojek has led to a new economic movement called the sharing economy, also known as a collaborative economy or shared economy. Application of technology and communication (ICT) which is owned by Gojek facilitates communication and transactions (Anwar et al., 2015; Detikfinace, 2019). This transaction becomes economic-sharing for customers because they get access that facilitates the fulfillment of needs at competitive prices. Gojek as the application owner &quot;feels&quot; the economy-sharing the percentage of profits from existing transactions. Besides, the economy of sharing is also felt by the drivers and those who &quot;hold their wares&quot; on the Gojek application. The developments and services offered by Gojek inspire similar services in several areas not yet served by Gojek (Muhktar &amp;&nbsp;Muchammad, 2011; Paquette, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the Gojek services is Go-Food. Inspired by the service, Agus Josiandi opened a similar but not the same business, namely &quot;Pesan Antar&quot; in Bangkalan (Christian, 2015; Eko, 2018). The initial existence of Gojek was aimed at serving the transportation of the people of Jakarta (big city, public transportation facilities are actually very attentive, there</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">have been conventional motorcycle taxi services) by utilizing application in smart phone (Ihsannudin, 2011). Whereas </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> by utilizing social media, its core business is delivering goods (not for human transportation) (Hendrastomo et al., 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Suprijati &amp;&nbsp;Yakin (2017), state that the construction of the Suramadu Bridge still does not have a full impact on the economy of the Bangkalan Regency. This is because based on Harrod-Domar theory analysis, the average actual growth (Gn) is greater than average warranted growth (Gw) or Gn 12.02%&gt; GW 5.9% (Suprijati &amp;&nbsp;Yakin, 2017), Furthermore based on data of Bangkalan in numbers (BPS, 2017), from 473,411 workforce in 2014, there were open unemployment of 17,032 men and 9,862 women, while the labor force in 2015 was 481,352 of that number unemployed men amounted to 13,570 and women amounted to 10,500. This unemployment rate was very large at 17.6% in 2014 and increased to 19.99% in 2015.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">High unemployment rates and glittering transportation access to and from Bangkalan with the existence of Suramadu bridge, open access to &quot;trying&quot; both in positive and negative side. What is meant by a positive &quot;try&quot; here is the better transportation access from and to Bangkalan, opening opportunities for people to &quot;do business&quot; (read: entrepreneur and even entrepreneurship). While the negative side referred to above is that the operation of the Suramadu Bridge will automatically reduce the reduction in some jobs, even the existence of the Suramadu Bridge actually erodes the number of Public Passenger Cars (Maika, 2016; Tjitradi, 2015).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Motorcycle taxis' (</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">ojek</span><span class="font9">) has not yet become a transportation mode that is commonly used by the people, so this &quot;</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">&quot; business is a &quot;new&quot; service for the people of Bangkalan (Eko, 2018). In many studies, it was mentioned that the choice of being an entrepreneur is after deadlocked in meeting the economic needs and impartiality of the opportunity to work in the formal sector (Tambunan, 2009). As the name suggest &quot;</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">&quot;, at the beginning of its establishment to provide foodpurchasing services (such as Go-Food). Seeing a large market share in the field of delivery services, then also widen services on shopping orders for kitchen and other household needs (Aldo, 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At present, the number of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">’s couriers are twelve, with demographics varying by gender, age and level of education. Noted, from several couriers of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> that dominant male sex, there is also one female courier who had joined. Whereas from the level of education, no less than five couriers of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> are graduates of Universities with Diploma and Bachelor's degree. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> also conducts free promotions for home industry players MSMEs where the majority of them are housewives without shops (product display place) (Osterwalder &amp;&nbsp;Pigneur, 2010; Putra, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hendrastomo </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font9">., (2016) have examined the contribution of online motorcycle taxis' existence socio-economically in Yogyakarta from the driver's side. While Amajida (2014), has examined the meaning of the use of online motorcycle taxis in Jakarta as a user's strategy to reduce the risks that occur in terms of uncertainty in transportation modes along with a variety of technological features that support the business. Later on, Salim &amp;&nbsp;Ihalauw (2017), explained that Gojek had brought up a new economic movement called sharing economy based on the perspective of added value and competitive advantage. In the economic model of sharing among MSMEs, Choi </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font9"> (2014), mentioned the need for an active role of the Government especially the Regional Government in mediating cooperation schemes and other benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Indonesian Minister of Communication and Information Rudiantara said that sharing economy will grow in an economic sector that is still inefficient (Hutabarat, 2018). There have been many studies exploring ICT-based businesses but have not been found to discuss them from the perspective of (Choi </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font9"> 2014). Choi </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font9"> (2014), have built an economic model of sharing MSMEs with the canvas business model. By exploring the sharing economy with the model of Choi </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font9"> (2014), it is expected to be able to understand the relevant parties and their impacts in more detail in all categories of constituents involved. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> as a form of creative use of information technology and entrepreneurship of &quot;young people&quot; not only open employment for owners and couriers (internal company) but also have an impact on the development of MSMEs in Bangkalan. That is because in promoting its services, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> also promotes MSME products that can be purchased with its services (Safira, 2018; Yunus, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This research interest in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> (MSMEs) business as due to the stakeholders involved and its ability to survive until now (2019), when similar competitors and even grab have been operating in Bangkalan. Based on previous studies and preliminary observations about </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">, the purpose of this study is to explore the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> business strategy and present the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> business model regarding the economic sharing model between MSMEs (Choi </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font9"> 2014)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This study expected contributions will be given in terms of theoretical and practices business strategy. The contribution of theoretical given by this study is presenting a sharing economic business model of MSMEs in Indonesia based on the economic sharing model between MSMEs developed by Choi </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font9"> (2014). Whereas in business practice MSMEs, this study provides a &quot;Real Example&quot; of applying business strategies, especially business pioneering with the economic sharing concept based of information technology (social media) that is able to survive and have position. &quot;Real Example&quot; which is a reference for business practices in this study is pursued through the ethnometodology method. Both of these contributions become the renewal of this study.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Research Method</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">This study uses a qualitative method. The qualitative method was chosen because this study aims to get a &quot;depth&quot; understanding of the existence strategy of the &quot;</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">&quot; business based on the internal and external perspectives involved. Then this study constructs it on the economic sharing business model Choi </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">et al.,</span><span class="font9"> (2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ethnomethodology approach is the approach chosen to achieve the objectives of this study. Kamayanti (2016), defines the ethnomethodology approach as &quot;everyday activities as members” methods for making those same activities visibly rational and reportable for all practical purposes&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Referring to Kamayanti (2016), there are &quot;keywords&quot; that must be examined in the use of ethnomethodology. The first keyword is &quot;everyday activities&quot;. &quot;Everyday activities&quot; in this study referred to how the business process of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">. The second keyword is &quot;members method&quot;. This study looks for the relationship of individuals (business management </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">) with their groups (not individuals) when doing their &quot;habits&quot;, namely business activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The third keyword is &quot;visibly rational and reportable for all practical purposes&quot;. This study seeks to find rational reasons for sharing economic routines carried out by</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> stakeholders. The fourth keyword is &quot;accountable&quot;. Kamayanti (2016), explains what is meant by &quot;accountable&quot; is an activity that can be understood as an activity that is experienced and can be observed by all group members and then reproduced due to the agreement. &quot;Accountable&quot; in this study is a business model and sharing economy that is carried out by the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Departing from the objectives of ethnomethodology, Kamayanti (2016), explains that ethnomethodology is used because researchers look for reasons why a community/group/organization behaves with a certain rationalization structure without making improvements/solutions. As Kamayanti (2016), pointed out, if an ethnomethodologist examines LGBT behavior, then it is not allowed to justify the behavior based on God's revelation (Iqbal, 2011; Setiawan, 2019).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a preliminary &quot;map&quot; in business observations of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">, this study uses an economic sharing model between MSMEs (Choi et al., 2014). Choi et al., (2014), developed a economic sharing model among MSMEs with reference to the canvas business model. Choi et al., (2014), divide the economic sharing business model into 2 types. Type I is a type of shared economy in which excess goods and services are owned by anyone from outside the company and lent to the company. Whereas Type II is another type of sharing economy in which a company invests and shares with other companies' goods or services that are expected to be excessive if each company has it. The constituent factors of the sharing economy business model among MSMEs developed by Choi et al., (2014), are illustrated in Table 1.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Result and Discussion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Agus Josiandi, the Founder and Owner of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">, is a graduate of Bachelor’s Degree of Management. Agus's business talent (Agus Josiandi's nickname) has actually been honed when he was a child. This is based on his confession who is accustomed to helping the work of his parents who have a slaughterhouse and a grocery store. While still a student, Agus had built a culinary business. But this business development was not as expected, so Agus decided to &quot;work&quot; as a reporter. The development of ICT has changed the way of life and offers many &quot;new things&quot;, not least in &quot;business&quot;. The rise of food sellers on social media, especially Facebook in Bangkalan Regency in the middle of 2016, was recognized by Agus as the initial idea of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> business opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;I see that in Bangkalan there are many women who have a home-based business and have the potential to develop. Especially businesses related to culinary. Many of these home-based entrepreneurs still carry out their home-based businesses offline, meaning that they are still conventional in nature. On the other hand, I see that some of these mothers already have some who use social media (generally Facebook) to simply sell their products there, advertise, and accept orders. Only I see is still not optimal. Unfortunately, because there is no accessible delivery service, the seller must also process the product delivery himself. A condition that is less effective for the business done by the seller if they have to do everything themselves from upstream to downstream. &quot;</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/54918-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:187pt;height:81pt;">

<p><span class="font9">Source: Processed Data, 2019</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With the idea to &quot;serve&quot; this business niche (at that time in Bangkalan there was no similar delivery service or application-based transportation). Accompanied by the lack of employment in the area where he lives (Bangkalan) so that the impact on the level of unemployment, moved Agus to return to entrepreneurship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;Beginning to start this </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> is actually because it is saturated with long work. Eager to start the entrepreneurship process at the time, but collided with minimal capital. You could say there is no capital. I also do not have special expertise, so think also at that time what kind of business is roughly right and can be run. Then I saw the potential that I knew a lot of places delicius food in Bangkalan&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At that point, Agus built a &quot;delivery service&quot; Business. The business is labeled &quot;</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">&quot;. By recruiting 1 courier at the beginning of its operation, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar </span><span class="font9">still exists today (2019) even having the onslaught of a similar business even when Grab has been operating in Bangkalan. The initial capital to build this business is &quot;only&quot; Rp. 500,000 on August 10, 2016. The initial capital Agus used to build &quot;branding&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;I am determined to make business cards, delivery jackets, and transaction notes. At that time I tried to build a reputation first, even though my business had not started. I think, this kind of service that is needed first is trust, so people don't hesitate, for example, we want to use our services. Partners and customers know whom to contact if there are complaints to whom, and so on. While waiting for all the details to be there, I began to build branding with an account named </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> on social media. My focus was on Facebook at the time because it was the center of online media for the average mother there. Start many questions”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the beginning of its establishment, the task of the operator was directly controlled by the founder of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">. In its development, after this business has been running for three months, the operator's duty is given to one of his trusted employees. This trust employee is the first employee to join.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In its development, the organizational structure of interagency messages as shown in Figure 1. The Founder works as a &quot;Director&quot;. The director monitors business and the quality of operator and courier services. In addition, the director is also in charge of conducting research and business development. The operator is in charge as the coordinator of the courier, as well as being the mediator/liaison/customer service in every order between the courier and the customer and business partners. Whereas the courier has the duty to take and deliver orders from business partners to customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;Position&quot; operators are handed over to Kris and Banna in turn. Kris was the first &quot;employee&quot; that Agus recruited at the beginning of the founding of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">. Initially Kris &quot;worked&quot; on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> as a Courier. Operator in charge of receiving orders from customers, then distribute them to the courier through the WhatsApp group. As explained by Kris:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;So, we made groub on whatsapp. All twelve workers joined the group. The first step the couriers must be absent in whatsapp group every day to start the work of this delivery. We started working at 8 am, to 7 pm. For couriers who do the first roll call, they get the task of making a delivery first. And so on in order until all the couriers get their turn. After the courier does his/her job, the courier is required to provide information to the whatsapp group and start doing the work again on condition that the task is completed first before getting the first position to deliver the customer's next order.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a delivery service business, the main aspect of this business is the availability of human resources of couriers. More and more couriers will accelerate and increase the number of &quot;services&quot; to partners and customers. During its development in the past three years, the number of couriers is now twelve with demographic levels that vary from gender, age, and education level. This amount always fluctuates, from the start this business was established with couriers entering and leaving for various reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The number of couriers of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> have fluctuations. The total number of couriers the most has ever had the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> in three years is fifteen couriers. The majority of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">’s couriers are men. Whereas only 1 female courier. Based on the level of education, five of the courier Messengers are graduates of a University with a Diploma and Bachelor degree and the rest are high school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">According to Agus, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> has reached the Break Event Point (BEP) in the second month after operating. Had used the payroll system at the courier at the beginning of its operation, but in the second month the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> had changed it to a profit sharing system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;The salary of the courier is paid monthly at that time, at the beginning of the operation. If there are tips obtained by the courier both from the seller partner (usually in the form of food sold) or the buyer (overpayment) purely the right of the courier. But at that time I started paying salaries for couriers in the second month with profit sharing.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This percentage of profit sharing has changed several times. At present, the percentage used is 85% for couriers and 15% for operations and owners. The profit sharing mechanism, even the portion of profit sharing for the courier of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">, is not without reason, this is done to keep the motivation and loyalty of the courier when there are competitors (similar services), even at the beginning of 2019 Grab services in Bangkalan are available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I see the tendency of the courier to decline its performance. His work motivation has decreased. Then I replaced it with a profit sharing system of 70:30, 70% for couriers, and 30% for operational management. Using this system was effective enough to get the couriers motivated again. Then it changed again to 85:15 in the second year. Besides that I also give bonuses when reaching certain targets”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;Revenue Sharing&quot; for operations is managed by Agus for the purchase of equipment such as transaction notes, commucation cost, operator salaries and other operational funds, and the rest is Agus’s (Director) income. Agus's income actually not only came from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">, because Agus also works as a TVRI reporter and also owns a coffee shop business. So even though the income from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> is very minimal Agus continues to run this business. Profit sharing is proven to increase courier loyalty:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;the sharing system in the delivery order made me even more excited to work. In addition to my family's economy getting better, I also finally have many friends and can build relationships with my customers. I also become more familiar with the Bangkalan areas and new culinary places in Bangkalan.&quot;(Interviuwed Agus Teach).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the initial year of operation, the total receipts of &quot;shipping costs&quot; of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> can reach six hundred thousand to seven hundred fifty thousand per day. With the emergence of competitors, there has been a decline in revenue in the third year. Average revenue per day can only reach five hundred thousand to six hundred thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In terms of the comparison of the number of customer services or the average order received by </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> also decreased, although the difference is not significant. In one operational year, all courier of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> can serve orders in the range of numbers 150-250 orders, in other words if there are twelve couriers at that time, each courier can work on 12-20 customer orders a day. In this third year, the average number of orders received by couriers is around 8-17 customer orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The decrease in revenue and the number of customer services, apparently did not affect the number of business partners who joined the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">. Despite the fluctuations, the total business partners are still struggling with 20-50 partners per year. Some partners are even very loyal to use the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> service as their partner for shipping customer orders, from the very beginning operating until now even though many similar competitors have emerged. The comperation Business development of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> when it began to operate 2016 (without competitors) with the availability of similar services in Bangkalan, especially </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Grab</span><span class="font9"> (2019) summarized in Table 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When viewed from the average number, the number of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">’s partners looks stagnant. From the Agus explanation, it is known that some of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">’s partners are MSMEs that do not have a place of business. This kind of MSME's business sustainability is very vulnerable to central figures. For example, if the central figure is a housewife, if she gives birth or increases domestic household activities, her business will cease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> business development plan is &quot;branding&quot; only on the service between goods (not people), because “humanitarian” reasons. This is as stated by Agus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;Among all the reasons, the main reason is the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> does not want to take the &quot;land&quot; of pedicab, public transport, and other services related to passenger transportation. Although the concept of fortune has actually been set up, I personally do not have the heart to contribute to narrowing the workforce of others.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Referring to the way taken by Gojek, the vehicle used by the courier and its fuel costs come from the courier's personal &quot;assets&quot;. This was explained by Kris (the operator) of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> when it was confirmed whether the costs of raw materials and vehicle repairs were from the company.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">&quot;No, unless the courier had an accident while working. But the change is not big, the biggest is usually Rp. 200,000.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For cooperation with partners, there is no &quot;special agreement&quot; with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">. This collaboration starts when there are customer orders to buy or deliver goods. In addition, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> is also active in initiating partnerships, namely &quot;marketing products&quot; of partners on the social media of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">. The marketing of partner products through social media can be done by internal of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> or as explained by Didin (owner of Q Store), </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">’s partner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;I made a product first, after that I posted on social media with the tagging of social media of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">, then after that there was an order. Customers usually directly contact the delivery person to order the desired goods or products. Sometimes there are also customers who contact me directly to order it. However, I still confirm the delivery order also to send customer orders.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Beginning with its appearance in 2016, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> can be said to be the pioneer of the delivery service business at that time in Bangkalan Regency (Maika, 2017) The absence of similar services, even Grab in Bangkalan recognized the owner as a distinct advantage at that time. For more than three years the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> business has been running, it is normal for competitors to have similar services. The presence of this competitor is considered not a threat to the sustainability of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">, as stated directly Agus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;There is nothing to worry about competitors. It is precisely this as a stimulant so that it can continue to improve, innovate and improve services. The presence of several similar businesses is not a strong threat to the sustainability of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">, given the different market segmentation &quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Courier of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> come from various backgrounds. If looked at the level of education, all couriers must have at least a high school/equivalent degree, although this is not a requirement to be a courier of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">. A requirement to be a courier of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> is having a vehicle, Sim C and an android-based phone. The choice of a courier of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> can be a main or side job. For Kris to be an operator as well as a courier is his main job and does not intend to find another job, as he expressed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;I became an operator starting from August 2016. At that time, I was looking for job vacancies after one year of unemployment. There is no, I only work on this </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">. Because in my opinion it's not complicated and its work depends on us. If you want to reach the target you must work hard. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In contrast to Kris, Agus Teach, one of the &quot;senior&quot; couriers of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">, took this profession as a side job. The following are excerpts of an interview with Agus Teach when they were confirmed the reason for joining the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;I joined the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> for economic reasons, because I had been married since May 2016 and my job at that time was a volunteer sports teacher at elementary school until now. My salary as a teacher is only Rp. 300,000 per month. IDR 300,000, if in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">, I can get 2-3 days. Because I have been on a long time to order, now I have a lot of repeat customers. So a week I get an average of Rp. 600,000. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the middle of the hustle and bustle of similar services in Bangkalan, Agus maintained the loyalty of his couriers by changing the payroll system to a profit sharing system and give bonuses when reaching certain targets, as explained before. In building the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> Business, Agus wants to be based on &quot;partnership&quot;. The foundation of</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">this partnership is both internal (management &amp;&nbsp;courier) and external (partners &amp;&nbsp;customers). So that the culture that is built is a family culture not a culture of superiors and subordinates, or bosses with workers. Agus always invited to discuss the &quot;Team&quot; message between to maintain business continuity. This &quot;formal&quot; discussion is held at Agus's Warung (Warung Bang Jos) every Monday night. This is illustrated by the following collection of interview excerpts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;This arises from every employee, namely the high sense of solidarity and kinship among fellow employees. So when there is an employee's family sick or accident, friends immediately help and visit him to make contributions together. So when you are close and like your own family it feels really good”. (Interviuwed Kris) &quot;Usually we hang out at the boss's shop every Monday night. The agenda is only limited to small talk, salary distribution, and complaining. Usually the boss also often gives input and motivation to me and my friends. The point is that this </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> have a strong sense of family. when one of the members was &quot;unfortunate&quot;, we were quick to help, unless he is delivering orders. Even the boss also gives financial support even though for treatment.&quot;(Interviuwed Courier, Agus Teach)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Even to foster a sense of kinship, Agus also involved his wife (Atik). Here is Atik's explanation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;Invited directly interact with operators, couriers, partners and customers. For example, once the wife of one of the couriers gave birth, was invited to visit her baby. There is a courier / operator who is married, invited to attend the event.” \</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Be a partner of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> there are no special requirements. There is no obligation to fill out the registration form, submission of administrative documents, or other strict requirements such as Grab or Gojek. Registration is free with “just say” to the founder or operator or tag on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> Facebook account. Even in some cases the process of cooperation into new partners </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> begins with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar </span><span class="font9">initiative to promote partner products. As long as partners are willing to have their products &quot;ordered&quot; by </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">, anyone can become a business partner, including street food vendors. The following is an interview with Agus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;I think the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> and MSME has a kind of symbiotic mutualism relationship. So the recognition of the MSME branding that we are promoting, the hope is to become a partner at the time, although it is not a necessity. So we just introduced the MSME, and that helped people too. If you then want to be a partner and use our services, God Blassed (Alhamdulillah). If not, that's fine too. It's each person's choice. So there really was that time, what we were promoting was not wanting to use our services, the reason was complicated, and so on. Yes, we understand. But most of the ones we help promote, after that usually use the Pesar Antar service, then if you make a promotional post they tag the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar </span><span class="font9">account. Our accounts became crowded by itself because it was filled with promotional posts by partners. Maybe because of the effect of picking up the ball earlier &quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The researcher confirmed the impact of the existence of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> on the MSMEs who had become partners. The following are the results of the interview with Ms. Wiwin (owner Pawonkoe):</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;</span><span class="font9">Efficient in working. Now usually consumers are often lazy (lazy to move) to buy something, including myself. So when there are consumers who order to me, I can</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">use this delivery service. I feel we are mutually beneficial to each other as well as symbiosis. I also use a delivery service when I want to buy kitchen needs for cooking. So it is not only used to deliver products but also buy products. Another benefit that I can feel is that my product is increasingly known to many people because </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> also help in marketing my product&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> never charges fees for collaboration, so that the Partner never feels &quot;his profit&quot; is reduced or must provide a higher price when cooperate with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">. The revenue received from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> is purely from the postage paid by the customer. Cooperation is done purely as a form of symbiotic mutualism. Agus's statement is the same as the partner's statement in the interview when confirmed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;Right, I didn't spend any money on delivery. The existence of this system is mutually beneficial. My sales are widely known among the people; this delivery service is also well known. Because I also continue to use the delivery service anywhere if there are orders from customers &quot;(Didin, Owner of Q-ta Store).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> also promotes small traders like me. Honestly, I started this business from scratch. From me, who was at first getting a conversation now, because I had to upload my food on social media to market my product, so I learned. This </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> never asks for profit sharing from partners. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar </span><span class="font9">only gets benefits from the courier service itself. &quot;(Wiwin, Owner Pawonkoe)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With the benefits and services felt by the Partner, growing &quot;other things&quot; in addition to the benefits in the relationship between </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> and Partners. As stated by Partners (Wiwin, Pawonkoe):</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;Until whenever I will not be separated from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">. I'm not a bean that forgets its skin. I am famous and have a name too because of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> has been very meritorious for my family's economy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another difference between </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> and other similar service-based businesses is determining rates. Similar services, such as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Grab</span><span class="font9"> setting shipping rates is calculated based on kilometers traveled, where the price per kilometer is around Rp 2,500,- to Rp 3,000,- </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> actually determines rates by mapping them by region. The farther the delivery location, the rate that is set also increases but still refers to the basic rate per region. Rates in the city of Rp 5,000,-, from the City (Bangkalan) to the neighboring Village (Burneh, Socah, Sabian) Rp 8,000,- and from the City to Kamal dan Tangkel Rp 10,000,-.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Riski, who has been using the delivery service from 2017 and knew about </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> from Facebook, explained that in addition to the rate, the reason customers choose </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> services is because of the service and the courier who “understands the field”. The following are the results of the interview with:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;It’s well, on time. If it's not on time the courier always gives information. In addition, even though it still rains deliver orders. Once at that time using a delivery service, then I overslept the same courier waiting in front of the house for about 30 minutes. Other courier services, in my opinion, do not yet know the location in detail in the Bangkalan area compared to the courier of interagency messages that already know a lot of Bangkalan areas. So the service is fast.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Source: Excerpted from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Pesan Antar”</span><span class="font9"> Owner, 2019 based Choi et al., (2014)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Whereas Type II is another type of sharing economy in which a company invests and shares with other companies goods or services that are expected to be excessive if each company has it. Based on the observations and interviews of informants, &quot;assets&quot; to provide services of key business not owned by the company (</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">) or the results of cooperation with other parties to provide them. Motorcycle is the courier's private property, while smartphone owned by the courier, operator, and owner. This &quot;asset&quot; is more owned by anyone from outside the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> and lent to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9">. The asset provided by the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> management are completeness of service, consisting of: Box, Courier jacket, Shipment receipt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Based on these findings, this study identified an economic business model of sharing </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> match with Type I economic models sharing among MSMEs (Choi et al., 2014). Following is the reflexivity of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Pesan Antar</span><span class="font9"> Business model data based on Type I economic sharing models between MSMEs (Choi et al., 2014).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The business strategy of “Pesan Antar” in beginning the busisness is build branding for costomers trust by creating &quot;assets&quot; (jackets, boxes to carry good/orders, and transaction notes) even though the business has not yet begun and “post” every activity business in social media (facebook). Pesan Antar used and focused on facebook because it adjusts the target market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the business is running, Pesan Antar applies a strategy of maintaining loyalty of the couriers with profit sharing and bonus mechanisms. Furthermore, to maintain internal (operator and courier) and external (partners and customers) loyalty of the company, Pesan Antar implementing family culture to run business. Pesan Antar implementing strategy for maintain business growth with always promote MSMEs products (though not yet a partner) to Pesan Antar’s Facebook account and no fees for being a partner of Pesan Antar. Pesan Antar Focus on goods delivery services, Pesan Antar business development plan is &quot;branding&quot; only on the service between goods (not people), because “humanitarian” reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While the strategy is to maintain customer loyalty, Pesan Antar does not use the application, this makes operators, couriers, partners and customers more familiar with each other and loyal. According to customers, loyal couriers become the competitiveness of Pesan Antar because couriers become more familiar with the &quot;field&quot; and can deliver orders according to the time customers want. Pesan Antar also apply service rate based on service region. This is different from similar services, which uses rates base on distance (kilometers).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because &quot;Assets&quot; to provide services of key business Pesan Antar privately owned by couriers and partners (MSMEs), are not owned by the company or the results of cooperation with other parties, it is in accordance with type I and not according to type II economic models sharing among MSMEs (Choi et al., 2014). This is a strategy business of Pesan Antar, with build capital branding in social media and without owned assets for key activities can serve customers and partners also provides profit sharing for couriers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the economic model of sharing among MSMEs, Choi et al., (2014), mentioned the need for an active role of the Government especially the Regional Government in mediating cooperation schemes and other benefits. Furthermore, Hendrastomo et al. (2016) and Amajida (2014) have mentioned that &quot;security&quot; is one of the important things for providers and users of online services. This study has not been able to present these two things at Tabel 3, Reflexivity of the Pesan Antar Business model data based on Type I economic sharing models between MSMEs Choi et al., (2014). Future studies are expected to be able to develop them by accommodating government role and security policies in their studies.</span></p>
