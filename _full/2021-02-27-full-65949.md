<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><span class="font5">—Mask, often known by Balinese as “</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tapel</span><span class="font5">”, is made of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">pule</span><span class="font5"> wood.

Bali has many types of mask dances that are often performed, which makes tourists interested in visiting Bali. Unfortunately, many tourists do not know the information contained in Balinese masks. The most important information contained in the character of the Balinese masks. The characters of each mask are different even though they have the same type. As mask art is also a cultural heritage from generation to generation, it needs to be preserved. It is necessary to have information in the form of technology that can distinguish the characters from Balinese masks. In this study, bag of visual word method in the classification process of Balinese mask characters is used, where in this method, there are several algorithms used, namely SURF as feature detection, K-Means as a clustering process to get the value of feature quantization, and SVM as a classification of Balinese mask character. The result of the accuracy level obtained from the testing process is 80%.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>I.</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Mask, or what is often known by the Balinese people as “</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tapel</span><span class="font5">”, is made of wood media. The types of wood that are usually used for making masks include cananga and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">pule </span><span class="font5">woods. Usually the character of the mask that is made is taken from the representation of the characters in &quot;badbad&quot; or a legend which emphasizes how the characterization of the character is performed in Balinese mask dance. In the mask dance, each performance or the dancer appears in a special outfit and wears a mask accompanied by the art of percussion (</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">gamelan</span><span class="font5">). So it can be said that Balinese mask art has a strong connection with dance and the art of percussion (</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">gamelan</span><span class="font5">) because every Balinese mask dance performance is always followed by Balinese dances and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">gamelan</span><span class="font5"> [1]</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">. </span><span class="font5">Balinese masks can be classified into 5, namely: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">bagus manis </span><span class="font5">(sweet and handsome) mask, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">aeng</span><span class="font5"> (scary) mask, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">bagus seram</span><span class="font5"> (handsome and scary) mask, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">lucu</span><span class="font5"> (funny) mask and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">galak manis</span><span class="font5"> (fierce and sweet) mask [2].</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With that many types of masks in Bali, tourists are interested in visiting Bali [3]. Tourists can find Balinese masks in traditional markets such as Sukawati markets, museums or mask dance performances, but many tourists do not know the information contained in Balinese masks. One information contained in Balinese masks is the character of Balinese masks. The characters of each mask are different even though they have the same type. So it is necessary to have information in the form of technology that can</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">distinguish the characters from Balinese masks. In addition, mask art is also a cultural heritage from generation to generation, so it needs to be preserved as stated in Pergub (Governor Regulations) No. 4 of 2014 concerning the Preservation of Balinese Cultural Heritage. One step to preserve Balinese culture is by combining art with technology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Balinese masks have various patterns but also there are many similarities. To be able to classify the character of Balinese masks, the first thing to do is to identify the patterns or characteristics of each image. Then with the identification information of the pattern, the image classification process is carried out. The classification process aims to determine groups or categories of patterns based on the characteristics of the pattern so that it can distinguish between images. For this reason, the authors seek several research sources that are similar in the proposed research.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>II.</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related Works</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">There are several studies related to this research such as Image Classification Using Bag Of Visual Words Model With FAST And FREAK [4]. This research explains that using the FAST and Freak feature in the feature detection process is very helpful in the image recognition process where the level of accuracy of the image classification reached 90.8%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Research [5] detected weeds growing between plants. There are 2 detection features used, namely SIFT and SURF. The resulting accuracy rate in this study is 96.5%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Research [6] used the SURF method as feature detection and SVM as recognition. SURF has a faster process than SIFT with the same advantages. The resulting accuracy rate is 97.87%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this study, we propose to use the bag of visual word method in the classification process of Balinese mask characters, where in the bag of visual word method, there are several algorithms used, namely SURF as feature detection, K-Means as a clustering process to get the value of feature quantization, and SVM as a classification of Balinese mask characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Until now, there are only a few research on masks in Indonesia, especially in Bali. In this study, the authors want to perform research which can later be used as a reference in developing the Balinese mask classification system in the future. This is considered important because it is a documentation of the introduction of Balinese art in the field of information technology on the classification of Balinese masks. Thus later Balinese, and also others, can recognize the classification of Balinese masks.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In conducting research, a research flow is needed to determine the steps in carrying out this research, as shown in Figure 1.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/65949-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:161pt;height:206pt;">

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Image Dataset</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Balinese mask image data was collected using a digital camera with the same distance and lighting data resolution settings. The image then subjected to a preprocessing process to give better results in the classification process. The preprocessing process was carried out by cropping the image to focus the image on the mask shape and changing the ratio of the input image to 200 x 250 pixels. The image that has been processed was then sorted based on the 5 characters of</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dataset Split</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The dataset used was split into 2 groups, where 70% of the sample data was used in the training process and 30% of the sample data used in the testing process. In the training process, the SURF Feature Extraction, K-Means Clustering, Feature Quantization, SVM Classification and Evaluate Classifier processes were carried out. In the testing process, the Evaluate Classifier process is carried out from the testing sample data with the model generated during the training process.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SURF Feature Extraction</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The SURF algorithm aims to detect the local features of an image reliably and quickly. This algorithm is partly inspired by the SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) algorithm, especially at the scale space representation stage. The SURF algorithm uses a combination of an integral image algorithm and blob detection based on the determinant of the Hessian matrix [7]. In its implementation, the SURF algorithm is divided into several stages as follows [8]:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Interest Point Detection is used to select points that contain a lot of information and are stable against local or global disturbances in digital image. In the SURF algorithm, a point of interest detector that is invariant to the scale is selected, namely the blob detection. A blob is an area in a digital image that is constant or varies within a certain range. To compute this blob detection, the Determinant of the Hessian (DoH) matrix of the image is used. Given the point x = (x, y) in image I, the Hessian matrix H (x, σ) at x with the scale σ is defined as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>r</sup>JTf γ [ <sup>L</sup>xx (x,σ)L<sub>x</sub>y(x,σ)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">^(<sup>x,σ</sup>) = [<sub>kyχ</sub></span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><sub>x</sub></span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">^) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><sub>kyy</sub></span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><sub>x</sub></span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">^)</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">∖</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"> (1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">L<sub>xx</sub>(x,σ)</span><span class="font5"> is the convolution of the second derivative of the Gaussian function </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">∂</span><span class="font5"> ^ 2 / [∂x] ^ 2 g (σ) with image I at point x. This definition also applies to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">L<sub>xy</sub></span><span class="font5"> (x, σ) and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">L<sub>yy</sub>(x,σ).</span><span class="font5"> In the SURF algorithm, the determinant of the Hessian matrix is calculated from the Haar wavelet using its optimal image integral. The determinant of the Hessian matrix is used as the basis for the SURF algorithm because of its scale invariance, stability and repeating easily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Feature Description is a feature defined as a part that contains a lot of information in an image, and this feature is used as a starting point for object detection algorithms. The purpose of this feature detection process is to obtain a description of the features in the observed image. The first step is to look at the dominant orientation of the point of interest contained in the image, then build an area that will be taken in value and look for the correspondence features in the comparison image. In determining the orientation of an image, we use the Haar wavelet filter. Here the level of slope of an observed feature can be determined (Fig. 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-Means Clustering</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">K-Means is a popular algorithm used in cluster analysis and is applied in various fields such as machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, and bioinformatics. The idea of k-means is to group numbers of n data into k clusters, where n is the part of the cluster with the closest distance or mean value [9]. The K-means grouping process is as follows. First, an initial K centroid is selected, where K is defined by the user and indicates the number of clusters desired. Each point in the data is then assigned to the nearest centroid, and each collection of points assigned to the centroid forms a cluster. The centroid of each cluster is then updated based on the points assigned to that cluster. This process is repeated until there are no cluster change points [9][10]. (Fig. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feature Quantization</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Clusters generated from the K-Means process are referred to as visual vocabulary where each result from the center of the cluster is visualized to construct a visual word occurrence histogram using Euclidean distance. Each extracted feature is allocated to its closest visual word (closest neighbor). A visual word histogram is then created by counting the number of features assigned to each visual word [11]. The length of the histogram is equal to the number of cluster centers generated by k-means clustering, where the value to n on the histogram is occurrence of the visual word to n. This process is commonly known as feature quantization (Fig. 4)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Support Vector Machine (SVM) [12][13] is a technique to do prediction, both in regression and classification . The SVM Technique is used to get the optimal split function (hyperplane) to divide the observation which has different target variable values. This hyperplane can be in form of a line on two dimensions and can be a flat plane on multiple dimensions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Evaluation Classifier[14][15] is the process of evaluating the results of the classification process to obtain an accuracy level using a sample of test data and a sample of training data. This process is used as a reference for the success rate in the classification of Balinese mask characters.

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>IV.</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Result and Discussion</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The feature detection process using the SURF method produces the best number of features in each character category as 1343. So that the total number of features obtained in the training dataset of 1343 × 5 Balinese mask characters is 6715. In the clustering process there is a parameter used in determining the number of clusters called the vocabulary size. By default, this will be set at 500. Based on the number of vocabulary sizes used, each sample will have 500 features which are depicted in the form of a histogram as shown in Figure 4. Based on the features that have been obtained, the classification stage is carried out using SVM to produce a model of recognition. This model is evaluated using a test dataset so as to produce a test accuracy matrix.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/65949-5.jpg" alt="" style="width:241pt;height:157pt;">
<p><span class="font3">Fig. 5. Confusion matrix result of classification data testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Based on the results of confusion matrix (Fig 5), it can be seen the level of success in the classification of Balinese mask characters. The value of the accuracy level from the test results can be calculated as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Accuracy</span><span class="font5"> = </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:line-through;"><sup>0.83+1+</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:line-through;">p.</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:line-through;"><sup>5+0</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:line-through;">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:line-through;"><sup>67+1</sup></span><span class="font5"> × 100 % = 80 %</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Testing at the next stage is to change the number of vocabulary used to determine the effect on the level of accuracy in classification. The number of vocabulary parameters used includes 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000. The results of accuracy level and processing time required for training and testing can be seen in table I</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In table I, it can be seen how the effect of vocabulary size on the level of accuracy of training and testing. At the training stage, the vocabulary size can have an effect on increasing the results, the level of accuracy and time required in training also increases. At the testing stage, the vocabulary size has no significant effect when the vocabulary used has reached 500. Based on these results it can be concluded that the vocabulary size 500 can provide good results in terms of the level of accuracy of training and testing. Besides that, the time needed is better than other vocabulary sizes.</span></p>
