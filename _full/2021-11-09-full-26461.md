<p><span class="font3">Munanese folksong is chanted by Munanese people in daily life. Munanese community is an indigenous ethnic in South East Sulawesi besides Tolakinese, Butonese, and Moronenese. The folksong is classified into three types, namely (1) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kau-kaudara</span><span class="font3">, (2) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lagu ngkodau</span><span class="font3">, and (3) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3">. They are distincted by rhythm and tempo, text organization, and word choices. Rhythm of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kau-kaudara</span><span class="font3"> is similar to cha-cha song with a quite fast tempo, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lagu ngkodau</span><span class="font3"> resembles pop song with a slow tempo, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> is like country song with a medium tempo. The text of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kau-kaudara</span><span class="font3"> is organized as a poetry; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lagu ngkodau </span><span class="font3">as a lyrical poetry; and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a pantun karmina</span><span class="font3"> (a two-line traditional verse). The most word choices in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kau-kaudara</span><span class="font3"> songs are animal, game, and non sense categories, but in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lagu ngkodau</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> are marine, environment, and cosmos phenomena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Due to Munaneses community status before the middle of 20<sup>th</sup> century as a illiterate society, the folksong was treated as a social medium. Members of the community used it to express every thing both individual and collective affairs. Related to the collective one, Munanese ancestor used folksong to convey morality messages that aims at making all members of the community well behaved. This circumstance endorses the existence of folksong as a medium of character building that contains educational values.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Munanese folksongs are various traditional songs chanted by Munanese people in daily life. The Munanese community is one among hundreds ethnic groups in Indonesia. It is an indigenous ethnic in the Province of South East Sulawesi besides Tolakinese, Butonese, and Moronenes. Munanese community inhabits Muna island that is administratively Muna region located at Southern part of South East Sulawesi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Most of Munanese people are fond of chanting folksong; in leisure, while they are working in the garden, trading in traditional market, guarding crops from animals attack, rocking child in a cradle, taking rest after working, feeling sad, disappointed, happy, etc; they chant certain songs. The elected songs are not determined by situation or activity they are doing, but depend instead on what songs they want to chant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Aderlaepe (2014:3-4) classifies Munanese folksong into three main kinds, namely </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kau-kaudara, lagu ngkodau</span><span class="font3">, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3">. They are distincted by melody and tempo, text organization, and word choices. Most of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kau-kaudara</span><span class="font3"> songs are chanted in rhythmic melody with a quite fast tempo, similar to cha cha. Texts of the song are organized as poetry. The most word choices are animal, game, and non sense categories. The songs are usually chanted by children while they are playing games or guarding crops from animal attacks in the morning or afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lagu ngkodau</span><span class="font3"> songs are chanted in rhythmic melody with a slow tempo. Texts of the song are organized as lyrical poetry that can be identified by the presence of singer as a subject in the first person. Culler (1997:71-75) asserts that lyrical poetry is the one in which the narrator speaks as the first person and contains a fictional imitation of ‘real world’ utterances. Text of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lagu ngkodau</span><span class="font3"> songs do not contain continuous stories, but a reflection of Munanse people’s daily life. The most word choices in the lyrics of the songs are categories of marine, environment, and cosmos phenomenon. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lagu ngkodau</span><span class="font3"> songs are chanted by adults or old people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> songs are chanted in metric melody with a medium tempo resembling country song. As the metric melody, accented voice are placed constantly at certain syllables. The accented syllables are the second and the seventh in every line of the lyrics.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/26461-2.png" alt="" style="width:91pt;height:49pt;">

<p><span class="font3">Texts of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> songs are organized as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pantun karmina</span><span class="font3">, a two-line traditional verse. The texts of the songs are short, two lines only, and every line consists of eight syllables. The words choice are used selectively to represent meanings, mostly are in categories of marine, environment, and cosmos phenomenon. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> songs are usually chanted by adults or the old ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Munanese folksong meets the characteristics of folksong in general as stated by Dananjaja (1997:141). He argues that a folksong consists of words and melodies, transmitted orally in a community, traditionally shaped, and has many variants. Every song of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kau</span><span class="font3">-</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kaudara</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lagu ngkodau</span><span class="font3">, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabahnti</span><span class="font3"> is built up by lyric and melody, transmitted orally in the Munanse community, and the lyric is quite varied. One or more words in the lyric of certain song can be different from one place to another in the community, but the meanings and ideas exist in the same aims. This circumstance is an evidence that the folksong is a collective expression in the community, not a personal one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Before the middle of 20<sup>th</sup> century, the Munanese community was an illiterate society. Every aspect of life was done based on the principles of oral tradition or oral culture. Ong (1982:34) asserts that thinking in an oral culture takes place in mnemonic patterns, shaped for ready oral occurrence. Folksong was an appropriate medium to Munanese community to accommodate their expression. It was an unwitten discourse as a base concept of thoughtutterance-behavior pattern in the community. This circumstance made Munanese folksong treated as a social medium that was used by Munanese people to express their ideas, religious and morality advices, critics, hopes, wishes, disappointment, sadness, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Related to the topic of this article, the writer emphasizes attention to functions of Munanse folksong as a medium to build character in order that all Munanese people behave well. The focus of discussion is educational values existing in the folksong as a character building device. The folksong is treated as a historical document produced by Munanese ancestors before the middle of 20<sup>th</sup> century when Munanese community was still an illiterate society.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/26461-3.png" alt="" style="width:91pt;height:49pt;">

<p><span class="font3">Educational values evoked in the lyrics of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kau-kaudara, lagu ngkodau</span><span class="font3">, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti </span><span class="font3">songs are discussed by employing literary anthropology approach. Principally the approach is not an anthropology, but a literary study on the folksong as oral poetry. Implementation of the approach in the discussion is done by connecting the analysis to social life of Munanese people in the past. Ratna (2011:359) argues that literary anthropology is employed in a literary study to explore cultural aspects existing in oral literature and the analysis is connected to the past social life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Educational value according to Wikipedia is the process by which people give values to others. It is from social or religious rules or cultural ethics that are conveyed and taught by a group in position of authority or more experienced, by transmitting or gradually doing in their own realization of what is good behavior for themselves and their community. Refering to this concept, educational value of Munanse folksong is pedagogic elements evoked in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kau-kaudara, lagu ngkodau</span><span class="font3">, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> including moral education and citizenship education taught by Munanese ancestors as more experienced people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Educational value is principally a cultural value defined by Jayawati et.al. (1997:4) as an abstract concept that covers a large scale of culture that contains ideas or the most valuable things in social life, from the emotional parts of human spirit. By exploring Malay folktales in North Sumatera, Jayawati concluded that cultural values of Malay folktales are hard working, be honest, low profile, sincerely to help, be patient, be polite, be cooperative, be appreciative, environment conserve, and prior to country’s sake than individual’s. All these items can be grouped into moral education and citizenship education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The educational value of Munanese folksong is related to the existence of folksong in Munanese community as oral literature functioning as pedagogic device. Bascom (1965:250) asserts that one of the four functions of oral literature is as a pedagogic device. To Munanese people, chanting folksong is inspired by various goals, one among others is</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/26461-4.png" alt="" style="width:91pt;height:49pt;">

Merton (1967:84-86) argues that all social and cultural activities have positive functions and each type of civilization, idea, and customs meets some important roles. Based on Merton’s argument, chanting Munanese folksong as intangible Munanese cultural heritage has positive functions, including to build character.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Literary anthropology is a new interdisciplinary approach in a literary study particularly on oral literature that emphasizes on cultural aspects in the literary works. The study is different from the one issued by Fernando Poyatos (1988) and G. Winner (1988) as an anthropology study on literary works. In this article the writer adopts the one that is proposed by I Nyoman Kutha Ratna (2011) as a literary study aims at exploring cultural aspects existing in oral literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Munanese folksong as a sub part of Munanese folklore is a source of information concerning sociocultural life of Munanese community in the periods before the middle of 20<sup>th</sup> century since written manuscripts were not found due to their status as a illiterate society. According to Dundes (2007:53), folklore (includes folksong) is a mirror of culture that can be treated as an information source to explore cultural aspects of certain community. Referring to this concept, literary anthropology is an appropriate approach to be employed in exploring cultural or educational values of Munanese folksong.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">song lyrics, whereas the story tellers gave information about sociocultural aspects of Munanese community long time ago. Secondary data were taken from library source especially the reports of relevant studies. The main instrument in collecting the primary and secondary data is the writer himself (as the researcher) since the research is a qualitative one (Sunaryo, 1997:25). Then, the obtained data were analyzed by employing heuristic and hermeneutic readings. The first step, heuristic reading is emphasized to comprehend linguistic conventions and the second one, hermeneutic reading is focused to comprehend literary and cultural conventions (Ricoeur, 1981:43). Since the lyrics of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kau-kaudara, lagu ngkodau,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> use symbolic words or phrases to state meaning, the writer employs Pierce Triangle technique to interpret the meaning. Principle of the technique is that every symbolic word or phrase has three aspects, namely </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">representament</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">object</span><span class="font3">, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">interpretant </span><span class="font3">(Riffaterre, 1978:5-6). The first one, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">representament</span><span class="font3"> is a represent element as a signifier; the second one, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">object</span><span class="font3"> is a represented element or a signified; and the third one, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">interpretant</span><span class="font3"> is a comprehension to the symbol or meaning.</span></p>

The utterance of an honest man is in accord with his behavior.

He/she confesses his/her mistake as well as his/her emotional feeling such as falling in love, sympathy, sad, anxious, and disappointed.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/26461-6.png" alt="" style="width:88pt;height:47pt;">

Since she does not know yet the background of the man, she can not accept his love. However she needs enough time to receive the love of the man. Implicitly, this song is preceded by another one that is chanted by the man previously and contains the expression of love. To give the man love means the respects and acceptance of his love.

A walking woman is symbolized by a coming sheep that honestly confessed by the singer (man) as his fiance. The singer chooses the woman because she is low profile in her appearance. She wears unluxirious dress although she is a noble one. Her bun is symbolized by teak, means she is from a noble family. Teak in Muna region is the most luxurious and expensive timber.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The message of sincerity in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> song number 4 above describes the willing of the singer to get nothing for the sake of a great affair. Lyric of the song in line (1) is a negative sentence. The singer neglects himself/herself of geting something.

<p><span class="font3">Politeness is derived from root of polite. It is a character viewed from the way of speaking and behaving. One is claimed as a polite person if he/she speaks and behaves well according to social norms. La Niampe (in interview 15 November 2014) asserted that social norms is a legitimate law in Munanes community. The norms are not written, but people of Munanese use as a parameter assessment of politeness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lyrics of Munanese folksong are arranged by using polite words to express morality critics. The polite words are symbolic ones which state the meaning not explicitly, but implicitly. The use of symbolic words is perceived more convenient to express the critic. However, woman or man as the addressee of the critic does not feel embarrassed. Song of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lagu ngkodau</span><span class="font3"> bellow uses symbolic words as a realization of politeness in expressing critic.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The meaning in the song number 5 above is stated symbolically. Point of the lyric is a critic on bad moral of a woman. She delivered her honor to a man as a wife who served her husband, but not yet getting marriage. She trusted the man for uncertain promise. The man promised to marry her next month. Unfortunately the man did not keep the promise. Sentence </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Podhandi naomba wula</span><span class="font3"> ‘promise when the moon appears’ in line (6) and (7) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gara tanoomba ghua</span><span class="font3"> ‘but the appearing thing is grey hair’ in line (8) describes that the woman was waiting for the promise, but she was befooled (by the man). Indeed she was waiting a falsehood and she did not get married until getting old for being disappointed. The word of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ghua</span><span class="font3"> ‘grey hair’ in line (8) is a symbol </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">representment</span><span class="font3"> that refers to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">interpretant</span><span class="font3"> of ‘getting old’.

Sentence in line (2) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bhahita sala mondawu</span><span class="font3"> ‘be careful you can fall down’ contains a warning to the woman that what she has done can drop her prestige down. The warning then continuous in line (3) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bhe kahalino polangku ngkeda</span><span class="font3"> ‘a ladder is so hard to be stepped, honey’. The warning emphasizes how hard the woman passed her daily life if such condition. In line (6) and (7) the sentence of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Podhandi naomba wula</span><span class="font3"> ‘promise when the moon appears ‘ means that the man had promised to marry her next month. In line (8) the sentence of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gara tanoomba ghua </span><span class="font3">‘But the appearing thing is gray hair’ means the man never kept his promise, until the women was getting old. It is symbolized by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ghua</span><span class="font3"> means “grey hair”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The educational value in the song number 5 above is the necessity to be careful in loving someone. Particularly a woman should not trust a promise of a man who is not recognized well. It is a danger in loving somebody too much before knowing him well.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Patience is a high capable attitude to control emotion not to get angry.

The patient one also is not easily to be hopeless when a worse thing happens to him/her such as failure or injustice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The expression of meaning in the song number 6 above is shown in two layers.

At the first layer, the song states condition of the singer patiently faces bad attitude of self-oriented men in the authority who govern in tyranny. The meaning in the second layer states the patience of the singer who was disappointed since his beloved girl friend married other man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Through the lyrics of the song number 5 above the ancestor of Munanese conveyed advices. Firstly, we should be patient to face tyranny of government authority. It is not necessary to struggle alone to face the tyrannyof authority since it is only a boomerang. Their authority however will end at a certain time and the good fortune is possible at our side. We have to be patient in waiting the chance to hold the authority. Secondly, one is not necessary to get angry if his beloved girl friend married another man. In the situation like this, we get nothing except embarrassing ourselves if we can not restrain the anger, although we are disappointed.</span></p>

The word of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mbadha</span><span class="font3"> ‘the bodies’ in line (2) is a metaphoric expression that refers to a group of people. The song is usually chanted by a group of women to state their willingness to do a certain activity together with a group of men. The activity is chanting reciprocally all night long. The statement about the willingness to chant reciprocally that is uttered by the group of woman is a form of appreciative. They appreciated and respected the group of men who had invited them to chant reciprocally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The message found in the song of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> number 7 above emphasizes the importance of respecting and appreciating others who behave well to us. The invitation of working together is good and should be appreciated. In Munanese community, the main entertainment long before the end of 20<sup>th</sup> century was </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> performance. It was done in the night, starting from evening and ending in the morning. The performance was namely </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">modero</span><span class="font3">. The performing of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">modero</span><span class="font3"> was done by two groups, men and women groups. Both groups sang </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> songs reciprocally, one group was the opponent of the other one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Modero</span><span class="font3"> performers dance simply while they chant reciprocally. They hold hands among others and swing their hands into front and behind. They move from left to the right side to form a cycle. The group who began to compose </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> song and chanted together was the men. While the men group were chanting, the opponent (women group) analyzed the meanings and messages conveyed, then they composed an appropriate song to reply the men. As the men finished chanting, the women immediately chanted their song that had been composed. Therefore each group analyzed the meanings and messages of the opponent’s song, composed a new song to be a suitable reply, and chanted the song that had been composed.

<p><span class="font3">An amazing competence owned by both groups makes us asking a question, how they could produce a new song in a short time? When Milman Perry observed a Guslar, a story teller in Yugoslavian Moslem community, Guslar’s competence to told epic story in one or more hours without reading scripts amazing him. Albert B. Lord who continued Perry’s study was sure that a singer as the story teller used certain device. Actually the singer used theme and formula as the devices which enabled him to tell story without opening the scripts (Lord,1988:30-68).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">modero</span><span class="font3"> performers in Muna and Guslar in Yugoslavia were different. Guslar recreated the texts by combining theme and formula devices. The singer adopted some important points of the story and rearranged the points by using formulaic structure. The formulaic structure enabled him to develop and adapted the story based on audience’s interest. On the other hand, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">modero</span><span class="font3"> performers had to compose new songs in short time as the reply of the opponent’s. Since </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kabhanti</span><span class="font3"> song had no scripts, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">modero</span><span class="font3"> performers did not recreate the texts. They indeed created new texts. The interesting question is what patron they had? The most important aspect in oral tradition is memory. They had adequate vocabulary of the song in their mind. Lord (1981:451) asserts that memory is very important to traditional singers. They remember words or phrases they have heard from other singers or they ever used previously. Memory is a very vital device that enables </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">modero</span><span class="font3"> performers</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Munanese people as a illiterate society before the middle of 20<sup>th</sup> century treated Munanese folksong as a social medium that was used to express many important things both individually and collectively. Due to this circumstance, the folksong has various functions. One of the various functions of folksong is a character building device.
