The result of this study indicates the Dloop of mtDNA of bali cattle is homologous with banteng Two haplotypes can be identified The sequence is different from that of Bos taurus Bos indicus Bos javanicus and Bos gaurus Further research needs to be done with a representative sample for the entire population in Bali by targeting more than one locus In addition the effective population size of bali cattle needs to be known to improve the genetic quality of bali cattle"
