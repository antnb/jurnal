<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tujuan utama dari penelitian ini adalah untuk membahas dan menganalisis tentang arti dari variasi kata yang digunakan pada register ekonomi dan untuk mencari seberapa seringkah kata-kata itu muncul dalam register Ekonomi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Data yang digunakan dalam analisis ini diperoleh dari beberapa artikel Jakarta Post, yaitu:(edisi 23,24,25 Juli) dengan menngunakan metode kualitatif diskriptif. Data yang terkumpul kemudian dianalisis secara deskriptif berdasarkan keragaman bahasa yang ada dengan menerapkan dua teori yaitu:</span><span class="font0"> (Trudgill (1974 dengan bukunya yang berjudul </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">An Introduction to Language and Society ) digunakan untuk menganalisis variasi Bahasa</span><span class="font0"> . Teori Mackay dan Palmer (1981 dengan bukunya yang berjudul </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Language For Specific Purposes, Program Design And Evaluation) digunakan untuk menganalisis Register dalam Ekonomi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hasil analisis data menunjukkan bahwa ada tiga jenis kata yang digunakan dalam register ekonomi, yaitu: kata benda,kata kerja dan kata sifat.Dari hasil analisis diatas menunjukan bahwa kata benda yang mendominasi atau sering muncul dalam Register Ekonomi.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of Study</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">The language and discourse of economic has been the subject of considerable analysis, although it is not clear whether it is the specific discipline or the broad disciplinary area that is under discussion. Much of the research has been concerned with the textbook and with the abstract language and metaphors used to set up to the models essential to economic description.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Talking about social context as the theme of this discussion, it is very clearly pointed to the social aspect of a society. The social aspect meant here are educations, economic, professions which have produced social classes in a society. These social factors are reflected through the language produced of each speaker and used the varieties of language. “Linguistic varieties that are linked in this way to occupation, or profession have been termed Register. For example,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">languages used in economic are different from the languages of engineering and so on” Trudgill (1974:101).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Register of economic is language varieties that are referring to economic condition. They are constructed and sometimes have different meaning from the others. Based on the reasons above the analysis in sociolinguistic point of the Register of Economic would be classified and analyzed as the topic of discussion. The meaning of words that used in Register of Economic and their correlation in our social lives as well as some articles in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jakarta Post would be used</span><span class="font0"> as the sources of the data in writing this under graduated thesis.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Related to the background of the study above, the problems of the study are formulated as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kinds of the language variety were mostly used in the economic register?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0">A method means procedure or process needed in collecting or writing to determine the data in writing a scientific paper. Research method was intended to understand a complex issue or an object and as well as to strengthen what has been known through the previous research. There were three main classifications applied in research methods in writing this under graduate thesis: data source, method and technique of collecting the data, and method and technique of analyzing the data.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Source</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">The data source in this study were taken from ten tittles in Colum of economic business</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">in The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jakarta Post newspaper</span><span class="font0"> article (edition July 25, July 24 and July 23 in 2013) These articles were selected as the main data in writing this under graduate thesis because they contained a numbers of words in the register of Economic which were relevant to this study.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Collecting Data</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Documentation method was used in collecting the data. The technique of collecting the data was by reading the newspaper repeatedly to identify a diversity of languages used in the registers and noted down all of the important data related to the information needed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and technique of Analyzing Data</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Firstly, reading the data repeatedly, taking note down and then classifying all the data based on their classification. Secondly, the data were examined carefully in order to understand their classifications whether they were nouns, adjectives or verbs which dominantly appeared in the register of economic based on their appearance frequency and analyzed by applying the descriptive qualitative and quantitative method. Thirdly, the data were analyzed based on the theories proposed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">As in the common situation in human life society, language varieties used in Register might have different meaning from the language we use in our social lives. Most of the words could be classified into a unique Register of words in economic. And the Register words of economic terms most or frequency occur in the economic field, as they use in the context of several articles and terms of dictionary in economic.

<p><span class="font0">The following explanation was the steps, how to find the words in the languages varieties in the register of Economic whether they belong to the registers of languages varieties or they belong to the register of economic</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font0">In this step it would also be described more detail the method and formula how those words found in the languages varieties in the register of economic whether they belong to high or lower frequency. The result of the comparison whether the words were high or lower frequency could be seen how often they could be applied in each registers. The result of the percent of words were taken from the whole words that most appeared in the data sources then they were divided with the total of the words in the data sources then times with 100% then the result could be seen in the first data bellow: Here are the process and the result of the first data.</span></p>
