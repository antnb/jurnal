<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of the Study</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Starting from a need of entertainment from the internet, sites that contain jokes began to emerge. One of them that increasingly popular today is 9gag.com or more commonly referred to as 9gag. 9gag is an international comedy website set in Hong Kong but hosted in the United States. It was launched in 2008. Even if the jokes that were posted on 9gag.com came from various backgrounds, but all 9gagers, the 9gag lovers, use and understand </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> (sing: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2">), the typical comical sign that used in 9gag. The posts in 9gag.com are comical stories and funny pictures that usually come up with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2">. There are more than 25 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> in 9gag.com and some of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> are popular even outside 9gag.com, like in social network Facebook and Twitter. These </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> then become the ‘trademark’ of 9gag.com.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This study analyzed two typical </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> that frequently used in the posts, “Poker Face” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2"> and “Okay” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2">, These two </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> are the most popular ones</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and start to get their fame not only among the 9gagers, but also non-9gagers, and posted in some social networks like Facebook and Twitter. These two </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> also have certain function and often appear exclusively to give comment about a picture.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aims of Study</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The aims of this study are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1.</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find out the signifiers and signified of each </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> used in 9gag.com</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2">The data source of this study was taken from</span><a href="http://www.9gag.com/"><span class="font2"> www.9gag.com.</span></a><span class="font2"> This study took two </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> that are explained before in the background, “Poker Face” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2"> and “Okay” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2">. This source is used because the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> are found only in 9gag.com. The reason why only these two </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> are used because they are the most popular in 9gag.com and often shared via social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.

<h1><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Collecting Data</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In collecting data, both library and online research were applied. First, library research was used to obtain information about semiotic theories, the concepts of signs, meaning, and context of situation theory. It is relevant to be used in analyzing meaning and function. Next, online research was applied to collect the data from </span><a href="http://www.9gag.com/"><span class="font2">www.9gag.com.</span></a><span class="font2"> Data that were collected from 9gag are the picture of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> and posts that used the two </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2">, “Poker Face” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2"> and “Okay” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2">.

<p><span class="font2">The data were analyzed based on the theories applied in this study. The theories that were used are the theory of semiotics from Saussure and the theory of semiotics and signs by Chandler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">First, the theory from Saussure about semiotics were used to analyze and find out the signifiers and signified of the two </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2">; “Poker Face” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2"> and “Okay” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2">. In analyzing the signifiers and signified of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2">, the features of each </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> were analyzed using semiotic theory from Saussure about signifier and signified. The signifiers of each </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> were analyzed to get the signified. Next, the function of each </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> in the post was analyzed using the theory from Chandler.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The original forms of each </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> were analyzed using the theory from Saussure by analyzing the signifiers (features of each </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2">) to get the signified which is leading to the meaning of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memes</span><span class="font2"> in 9gag.com are the signs of various comical facial expressions of human being that particularly found in 9gag.com.

<p><span class="font2">From the signifiers and signified for each features of “Poker Face” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme </span><span class="font2">above, it can be concluded that “Poker Face” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2"> indicates a facial expression of someone who is ‘flat’, showing no specific emotion and just keep silent because of something, maybe awkward or embarrassing situation, that caused him/her does not know how to react with that.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Post 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are three symbols in this post. The first one is a sentence “The awkward moment when you’re at your friend’s house and your friend is getting yelled at, so you just stand there and pet the dog”. This verbal sign act as the symbol that used to represent what the writer wants to communicate about the situation in the post. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">second one is a phrase “Good boy” that used to represent what the character in the post said when he pet the dog. The last one is the phrase “Poker Face” that used to represent the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2"> as the facial expression of the dog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are two icons in this post, both in cartoon form. The first one is the dog and the second one is the boy or the main “actor” of the post who pet the dog with nervous expression. These icons are representing what is happened in the post and illustrating the verbal signs or the symbols.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The awkward situation is the psychological setting in this post. From the symbols and the icons it can be conclude that the situation in the post is when the boy is at his friend’s house and his friend is getting yelled at. He does not know what to do and only stand and pet his friend’s dog. He is trapped in an awkward situation, and the “Poker Face” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2"> within the dog indicates that the dog also feel awkward because the boy suddenly pet him with nervous expression in the tension situation when its master is getting yelled at.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Post 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Symbols in this post tell what is happening in the post. In the first section there are three symbols or sentences that have different function. The first one is “Taking a look at myself in the mirror” that explains the activity done by the character. The second one is “I’m not that ugly!”. This symbol is said by the character, indicates the character’s thought about himself that he is not ugly. The third one is “the mirror”, explains the picture above it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the second section, there are two symbols. First is a sentence that is said by the character, “Gonna take a snapshot of how awesome I look!”. This explains what the character is going to do, taking a picture of himself that he thought as “awesome”. The second symbol is the word “click” that represents the sound of the camera when he took his picture. In the third section there is only one symbol in a form of word, “Result:” that indicates the result of the picture-taking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the last section, there are two sentences that act as symbols. The first one is “Guess I’m pretty ugly after all” that represents what the character said and thought after he seen the result of the picture-taking. The second one is the word “delete” that</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">indicates the character deleted the picture because he found out he is ugly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The icon in this post is the cartoon picture of the character including the picture of mirror, phone, his ugly face in the photo, and all of his face expressions including the “Okay” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2">. All of these icons are illustrating the verbal signs, like the ugly face in the third section illustrating the result of picture-taking, and the “Okay” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2"> in the last section illustrating that after he seen the picture he realized that he is ugly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the symbols and the icons the abstract concept of what the signifier mean can be concluded. It can be seen that the character was looking at his reflection in the mirror and thinking that he is awesome and not so ugly. Then, he decided to take a picture of himself. But when he saw the result, he realized that he is not awesome like what he thought. He is ugly, and the “Okay” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">meme</span><span class="font2"> indicates that he just accepted it because it is the reality and he had seen the evidence, the picture of himself.</span></p>
