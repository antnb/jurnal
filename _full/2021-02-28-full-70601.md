<p><span class="font3">Sudarsono statement (1998: 126), can be used as a foothold for understanding the Selonding in Tenganan Village is a sacred gamelan. In presenting it several requirements must be obeyed, that is: 1) a chosen venue is required which is sometimes considered sacred, 2) it is necessary to choose an elected day and time which are usually also considered sacred, 3) an elected player is required, usually those who are considered sacred or who have cleansed themselves spiritually, 4) required a set of offerings that are sometimes varies greatly, 5) goals are more important than aesthetically pleasing appearance, and 6) wearing a typical fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the people of Tenganan Village, the sacredness of the Selonding gamelan is not just an outward statement, but totalist the integration of thoughts, feelings, words and attitudes, so that treatment of Selonding it is prostrate.

<p><span class="font3">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gamelan Selonding Tenganan is a relic of history that is very sacred by the people of Tenganan. Until now, still maintained continuously three gamelan barungan Selonding were placed in each Bale Patemu. Indeed, the most sacred and sanctified are the three blades gamelan that is not installed and never been played. These three blades of the gamelan are called Bhatara Bagus Selonding. The expression of religious-emotion through Selonding gamelan is an expression of the people of Tenganan Village as a form of offering. Selonding is not only respected, sacred, sanctified, but fulfills all the vibrations of the community of Tenganan Village. in filling space, time, and circumstances.
