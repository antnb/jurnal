In improving the quality of the image basically makes the appearance of an image better than before One thing that is done in improving the image quality is noise qualification This noise qualification aims to reduce the level of noise contained in a digital image In this study the image used is the image of Bali palm leaf There are many methods that can be used to qualify for noise One of them is the Gaussian filter In this study Gaussian Filter is used as
