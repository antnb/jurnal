<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Collecting Data</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Several steps are used to collect the data, as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, intensive reading was done by reading the data source carefully.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, note taking was done by noting down the words which have relationship with the topic.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the adverb of place were identified and classified based on form, position, and function.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the relevant data were quoted.</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Analyzing Data</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The data, which were collected, were descriptively analyzed to show how they are actually used. There are several steps in analyzing the data. Those are as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step done in analyzing the data was checking and examining the collected data in order to know whether the data supported the analysis or not.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second was classifying the data based on the problems discussed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third step was analyzing the function of adverb of place.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the relevant data which had been collected were identified, classified then finally the data were analyzed based on the theory. The first problem was the theory of Huddlestone (1984) to describe the form of adverb of place. The second problem was the theory of Swan (1995) to describe about the position of adverb of place. The last problem was the theory of Quirk (1985) to describe the function of adverb of place in the sentence.</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Analysis of Function of Adverb of Place</span></h1></li></ul>

It describes the place “the jungle” Bulan</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Kuning separates from her mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The analysis form of adverb of place, there are 4 data for derivational form and 16 data for non derivational form. Most adverbs of place are non derivational form. The data of adverb of place in the story Balinese Folktale belong to this form because they have single word. The data are called pure forms because they cannot be formed again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the position of adverb of place, there were 4 data found for initial position, 10 data for mid position, and 6 data for end position. Adverb of place appeared in all positions in the sentences; they can appeare in front, middle, and the end of sentences. Front position, adverb of place occurring at the front position, means appear before the subject of sentences. Middle position, this term is used for those adverbs which are normally before the main verb. End position of adverb of place is for those adverbials which are normally placed following the adjective or adverb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The last analysis is about the function of adverb of place, there are 6 data for complement of preposition, 4 data for modifier of noun phrase, 5 data for adjunct, 3 data for disjunct, and 2 data for conjunct. Most adverbs of place are formed as complement of preposition. This function is mostly filled by adverb of place. For example: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">at and from</span><span class="font1">, these words can occur with other preposition.</span></p>
