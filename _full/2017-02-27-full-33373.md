<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract </span><span class="font4">Research grant/HUPS for Sociology Department from Udayana University utilized FGD to frame up the political education utilized by internship and learning via text book of ‘Political Parties Accountability’ published in 2015 at FISIP Unud that is compared with general lecture delivered by Nazrina Zuryani<sup>1)</sup> as guest lecturer at Bina Nusantara International (communication Department) in Jakarta. Bina Nusantara International University has not Faculty of Social and Political Sciences as in UNUD but all the students get double degree with overseas universities and Communication department belongs to Faculty of Computing and Media of Binus International. Political education at Sociology department of UNUD has not yet increase the critical thinking of students by argumentation while Binus International urge their students to be more critical for any social changes and global politics. Utilizing the organizational of political parties by Basedeau dan Stroh (2008), as well as the critics from Heywood (2013) who said that political parties have not yet successfully implementing politic of education for people especially the youth. This research is the result of comparing the political education that has been minor in critical thinking at Sociology department at Unud Bali but in contrary, it becomes a major critical thinking for global politics topic at Binus International in Jakarta. Both participants of Focus Group Discussion/FGD were 26 students and 21 students for general lecture. Almost 85% of FGD participants had undertaking subject of Political Sociology while participants of ‘Political Globalization’ never undertaking it. The result of FGD shows that most of students unaware of global politics as they focus only at subjects’ correlations while at Binus International, the general lecture participants shows the ability to synthesize the social and political engineering to face the dilemma of right wings that now are pandemic in the global world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction<sup>16</sup></span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Evaluating the results of the apprenticeship students of the academic year 2015 based on textbook entitled &quot;Accountability of Political Party&quot; as a means of political education becomes interesting to study. Moreover, the textbook was published by Udayana University Press, 2015 edition distributed free to students and to the general public. One of the universities that received two textbook the outcome of competence research grant are two lecturers and 5 students of Bina Nusantara (known as Binus International). In FISIP Unud, beside the students, lecturers were invited to participate to understand the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">correlation of national politics where the temperature sometimes heated related to political parties and how apprenticeship in five institutions, namely the Ombudsman, Bawaslu, Kesbangpol and the Provincial Election Commission becomes a new experience for the community and intern students in FISIP Unud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On November 10<sup>th</sup>, 2016, the research member (Nazrina Zuryani) of Hibah Unggulan Program Studi/HUPS received an invitation from the department/study program of Communication Science of Binus International to deliver a public lecture on global politics in relation to national and international social political changes. There are difficulties in comparing the two institutions, one in Bali and one in Jakarta. While in Jakarta, at Binus International, department of communication science is part of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Faculty of Computing and Media, and the students come from various countries (France, Germany, Turkey, Korea, Japan and Indonesia) as many as 20 people to listen the topics related to global politics (political globalization) that is associated with the tendencies of national politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, Udayana University on October 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2016, two members of the research group carried out Focus Group Discussion related to the evaluation of apprenticeship with aided textbook in search for political education at the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences. The FGD was attended by 26 students with the aim to recognize which problems inherent twisted political parties. The questions related to political education, the important of political science and the relationship of subject questions about education, the importance of political science and surrounding the course with a political understanding become part of the first session rudimentary. When entering the second session, that is a group discussion, with the same three questions, this topic becomes interesting</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This paper describes the different approaches in the research of HUPS inviting 31 apprentice students from three study programs to join Focus Group Discussion. Similarly, public lecture on the study program of Communication Science University of Bina Nusantara International aims at enhancing the political education in the global senes. Differences in approach is certainly very related on one side of understanding what is meant by procedural accountability of political parties and how the general election in the United States have highlighted the ideology of ultra right that denominated today's global political interests.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">II.</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Kartowagiran (2015) clarified an action research that promotes the research subject, the informant later became the main actors. Especially the role of Study Program to make evaluation on political education, various layers of interest can be considered significant. Firstly, the interests of research subjects that are all students who must understanding discourse of political education itself. Secondly, the research grant/HUPS evaluated the implementation of the apprenticeship in 2015 targeting 85 participants apprenticeship. Finally, when the study was carried out none of the 85 apprenticeship participants were presented but most of the FGD participants already undertaken the subject called “Sociology of Politics”. So, the action method in understanding political education using thematic criteria are presented both in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">FGD in FISIP Unud and in the public lecture at BINUS International in Jakarta. Topics or themes presented in FGD for research was targeted at the understanding of the meaning of political education, both political education in the national and global nuances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This paper further discusses the themes and content of the discourse in the cognitive construct of students about political education at every study program (in FISIP UNUD attended by 26 students from Study Program of Sociology, Political Science and Public Administration) at the time of FGD. And the public lecture on National Politics and Global Change was the theme in BINUS International, which was attended by 20 students from the department of Communication Science.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">III.</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results and Discussion</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical Study and Findings</span></p></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">In Indonesia, the role of political parties in the political education is very minor. Speaking about the main role of political parties, Heywood (2013: 398405) noted some important things. First, the representative function. This function is often seen as the main function of political parties in their ability to respond and to articulate the views of members and constituents. In the context of systems theory, political parties are considered as the main inputs which ensure that the Government pay attention to the needs and desires of the public. So, this function is considered to work well if the political system runs an open and competitive nature that encourages the role of political parties to respond to all the choices of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Secondly, formation and elite recruitment. In this function, the role of political parties is to provide candidates for the country's leaders. In this role, the political parties form candidates from the best cadres who are capable of translating the ideology of their party. Political parties should ideally become “</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kawah candradimuka</span><span class="font4">” (churning) for politicians to equip them with the skills, knowledge and experience, including involving them in the career structure of the political party concerned. In this context, Heywood (2013) exclude the reverse condition, in which the political parties are only used as a political vehicle of the powerful politicians to mobilize support for an election process. This function is often passed by the political party in which government officials are recruited from a small group of talented people or senior figures previously shelter from the major parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Third, the formulation of Interest. In this function, the political party through its cadres who are elected</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">as leaders at local or national level to formulate the government programs. The role of political parties here are not limited to just push to initiate certain policies, but also to formulate a series of policy options that are considered to be coherent and populists to gain the sympathy of the voters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fourth, articulation and aggregation of interests. In this function, political parties voice and collect a variety of interests that develop in the community, including business groups, labor, religious, ethnic or other groups that are thought to promote or defend their interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fifth, socialization and mobilization. In this function every debate activity, internal discussions, as well as competition in the election campaigns held directly by the political parties are considered to act as an agent of education and political socialization. The issues selected by the political party can help set the political agenda, or otherwise refuse certain policies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Dimensional Measurement of the Political Party Institutionalization</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fifth above roles can only be run if the institutional capacity of political parties have a strong capability and can perform well at the same time. The concept of Basedau and Stroh (2008) emphasizes towards the good capabilities, and consider the need for the measurement of dimensions of the institutionalization of political parties, among others:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Source: Pamungkas (2011: 75)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the table above, Basedau and Stroh indicate that the four aspects of the institutionalization of political parties includes rooting in the community, aspects of autonomy, organization and coherence. Rooting of political parties in the community refer to the extent to which the parties have stable roots in society; Autonomy refers to the extent to which political party independent of the individual from the inside as well from outside the party; organizational dimension refers to the extent to which the apparatus of political party organization consistently present at all levels of administration as well that their actions support the interests of the party; while coherence refers to the extent to which the conduct of political parties as a unified organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the time when the students study political science through national and global conditions, the role of political parties is vital. The thought of Basedau and Stroh is related by Pamungkas (2011: 75) to the conduct of political parties that has less strong roots in young people. Therefore, in the FGD the Students / of FISIP, Udayana University question the issue that political education is not associated with any political party. Different in a public lecture held by Binus International, a discussion took place warm with the topic of winning the US president from the Republican party. Of course, the root of the institutionalization of the federal constitutional State of America greatly affect the winning of the republican by the electoral college, which means through indirect election by the people but by the elector whose numbers 538 people. Binus International students understand the 'dawn raids' on the presidential candidate who was not elected. Republican party in the USA reached the coherent winning from the electors. Binus International students were able to criticize the institutional dimensions of the American electoral system that makes widespread thematic political education that is global situation after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The discussion was interesting and quite deep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ultra Right Tendency</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The public in Indonesia was once struck by the chairman of the House and staff visits to the parliament of the United States. At that time, a candidate for President of DT gives the participants of the comparative study a chance to meet him. The question of the presidential candidate is whether the Indonesian people know him? It was answered by the chairman of the House of Representatives yes and this news became trending topic for days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of Binus International student explained ultra right political tendency that hit the UK recently. As a result, the UK widraw from the European Union. This tendency is not without cause that comes from the EU economically has destroyed the pillars of the European economy by helping the bankrupt states like Greece and Turkey as well. The resistance of Londoners to accept immigrants from the EU got a final kick by the election (voting) to no longer participate in the union of the European countries. The exposure of Binus International students who understand what it is the ultra right ideology shows the critical power of global political education had been learned in Communication Science.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/33373-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:242pt;height:131pt;"><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/33373-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:241pt;height:167pt;">
<p><span class="font4">Surely the role of Study Program in providing political education is crucial for improving the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">competence of the students in Indonesia. Therefore, the course selection form needs to get more in-depth study so that students of social sciences and politics later can pass and be able to compete.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">IV.</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The students of FISIP Udayana University who participated in the focus group consists of the students from study program of Sociology, Political Science and Public Administration amounting to 26 people. Unfortunately, they are not students who carry out internship in 2015. The experience in the field on the Ombudsman institution, Kesbangpol, Bawaslu, KPU and the Public Accounting Firm are oriented to human capital deepening, ie improving the quality of human resources as the capital of his life into a selection of meaningful learning and enhance the critical power of political parties. Because they were never seen to follow an apprenticeship or not well informed about global and local political situation, the question concerning the political education got a flat response. Meanwhile, in a public lecture at Binus International campus, the Communication Science classes, the students who attended were 21 people and got a continuous learning experience in global politics, especially on the orientation of the Republican Party in the United States. Almost all of the students who attended the public lecture actively asked questions to understand that the role of the party in the United States formed a partisan ideology. Those in favor of their group only or opposition party that is democratically accept differences and more open political affiliations.</span></p>
