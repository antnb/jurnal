<p><span class="font1">The object of this research is the text of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geguritan Sucita</span><span class="font1"> having total verses of 1,877. The problem observed is that the structure, esthetic rule applied and source of text transformation into GS as religion literature. The main objective of this research is to answer the three problems concerned. In addition, it has the objective to preserve and develop </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">geguritan</span><span class="font1"> literature. The benefit can be as one of sources of knowledge in literary science, especially concerning </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">geguritan </span><span class="font1">literature; as the consideration in making policy related to religion and Balinese culture; and also as reading material, especially for readers of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">geguritan</span><span class="font1"> literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The theory applied in reviewing the three problems is structural, semiotic, intertext, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rasa</span><span class="font1"> (mode) and literature reception. The data source obtained by conducting literature study, observation and interview. The data is the analyzed from literature and religion point of view. The research novelties are as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">GS is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gita puja</span><span class="font1"> of Ida Ketut Jlantik (1905-1961) which is offered to God Almighty. As worshipped song, GS is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sekar</span><span class="font1">. The materials are quoted from classical works of prior Hindu which is then arranged in accordance with idealism of writers </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kawi-wiku</span><span class="font1"> by considering rule of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kavya</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">GS is established using Balinese language Kepara enriched with vocabularies of Old Javanese so it has Hindu esthetic. Formal structure of GS is established according to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">geguritan</span><span class="font1"> : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">padalingsa</span><span class="font1"> matrix. The text consists of 1,877 rhythm, 11 rhyme and 57 melodies. Sinom rhythm as the idol one to lead other rhythm in order to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">santa rasa</span><span class="font1">. Verses of GS can be grouped into two parts: 4 rhythm </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manggala</span><span class="font1"> and) 1,873 narrative rhythm. Totally, formal structure of GS fulfills </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">alamkara</span><span class="font1"> principle. the text has melody and euphony religious melody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Narrative structure GS is established following norm of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tattwa purarbhawa ‘</span><span class="font1">reborn cycle’, in addition it is the leader of rhythm as well as function as epilog. In term of contemplative reading level </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bhakti yoga, manggala</span><span class="font1"> is finally known as the center text of GS.GS narration is developed according to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">aguron-guron</span><span class="font1"> rule ‘having the teacher from spiritual and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nyastra</span><span class="font1"> tradition. From matrix </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">aguron-guron</span><span class="font1">, it is proposed two plots in paradox one: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kama</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tirtayatra</span><span class="font1">. Plot source of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kama</span><span class="font1"> is narrated by the existence of Sang Sucita. On the other hand, plot source of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tirtayatra</span><span class="font1"> is narrated by the existence of Sang Subudi. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kama</span><span class="font1"> (desire) and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ahangkara (ego) is the the problem source that characters of GS experience moral dilemma. Its message, if someone wish to succeed in reaching life objective, the two obstacles must firstly be defeated through learning process of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mulat sarira</span><span class="font1"> by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">yoga</span><span class="font1"> : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bhakti-karma-jnana-</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">yoga.</span><span class="font1"> After completion of narrating plot source of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tirtayatra</span><span class="font1">, it is also narrated </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kama</span><span class="font1"> which is developed into </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ahangkara</span><span class="font1">. For this reason, it is presented bad figure I Pataka to spread disaster which is in contrast with the common rule of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">geguritan</span><span class="font1"> literature. GS narration can be understood as reading model according to narrative structure rule of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kavya</span><span class="font1">. In every part of structure called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sandhi</span><span class="font1"> is expressed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rasa</span><span class="font1">. There are nine </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rasa</span><span class="font1"> that can be enjoyed in GS. The nine </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rasa</span><span class="font1"> is inter-related and function collectively to strength the main </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rasa</span><span class="font1"> of GS, namely </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">santa rasa</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Discourse of GS is established structurally like a diamond necklace: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">acara-susila-tatwa-yoga</span><span class="font1"> by narrating religious concept of syncretism idea of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Siwa-Buddha</span><span class="font1">. The philosophic thought is the three big schools of Hindu: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dwaita-wisisthadwaita-adwaita.</span><span class="font1"> The source text is having a discourse of declarativeimperative objective. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hypogram</span><span class="font1"> is much read in term of searching and then to bee expanded. It can finally be said that GS is a literature of Hindu that fulfills the requisite of mah</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">akavya</span><span class="font1"> in the domain of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sekar Alit bali</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Key words: </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">geguritan</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">religious literature, kàvya, yoga, sekar</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">aguron-guron, kàma, tirtayatra,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">rasa</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geguritan Sucita</span><span class="font1"> (GS) (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sucita</span><span class="font1"> Hymn) composed by Ida Ketut Jlantik (1905-1961) is a alive work as it has nobleness characteristics and thus it is a candle of life for the readers. It proves from positive appreciation from readers toward GS text and also for the composer. It is, however, the nobleness characteristics intended has not been studied deeply yet. In contrast, if reviewed from any literary aspect and religion, there are a number of main problems as follows :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philology problem : GS is a work where its rhyme develops from 1218 verses (in 1961 published by Balimas) - 1877 verses (1982 published by Kayumas and Bali Post) in different headings. Is this due to the creative response from its readers ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expressive problem : no clear existence of composer and the background of creative process.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objective problem : unconventional of formal structure and narrative structure and full of vacant rooms so it causes various of responses from its readers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inter-textual problem : various hypogram text of GS is not clearly read.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reception problem : what aesthetic norms and how they are applied so GS succeeds to be favourite reading for its readers ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious problem : if reviewed from certain perspective, the discourse of mixed school principles : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Siwa</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Buddha</span><span class="font1"> can cause social-religious conflict.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">From the six problems identified above, there are three main problems reviewed in this research as follows : (1) How is the formal structure and narrative structure of GS ?, (2) What is the ideal of esthetic norm and how it is applied by Jlantik in changing GS ?, (3) How is the source text is transformed again in GS as religious literature ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This research is ideally hoped to understand the specific expression and nobleness perspective containing in old Balinese literature of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">geguritan</span><span class="font1"> style: (1) its special structure; (2) esthetic norm applied by the writer; (3) the way of writer to transform the prior text, (4) various taste or meaning listed in it, and (5) the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">effect top readers of Balinese traditional literature. After understanding the special expression and the great view of it, this research also aims to preserve, develop and publish </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">geguritan</span><span class="font1"> literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the sake of implementing the above objectives, it is necessary to conduct a research concentration based on the formula of problems proposed to understand : (1) formal structure and narrative of Gs; (2) esthetic norm which is the ideal and implemented by Jlantik in composition of GS; (3) network of literature text and Hindu represented in GS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The comprehensive answer of these problems is expected to be beneficial for : the development of literature science; enhancing treasure of literary library; as guidance and consideration for the researcher and religious motivator and Hindu literature, especially in Bali; and as appreciation item or reading for the fun of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sekar alit</span><span class="font1"> (short rhyme)</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literature Review, Concept and Theoretical Basis</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">So far, it is obtained a number of writings that make GS as a discussion object. The writing intended is in term of letters transfer, and translation, description of structure and functional review and cultural review in GS: Budharta (1980), Nuarca et al, (1984/1985), Puspawati (1985), Purna et al, (1991/1992), Budiasa et al (1997) and Yasa (1999). From the works of this writings, it is known that the discussion tends to be partial and intrinsic, even extrinsic aspect of GS also determines literary value of GS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are five theories applied to review GS, namely :(1) Structural theory to review structure of GS; (2) Semiotic theory to review symbolic discourses in GS; (3) Intertext theory to review </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hypogram</span><span class="font1"> of GS; (4) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rasa</span><span class="font1"> theory to analyze rasa and dominant rasa in GS; and (5) reception theory of literature to review the response of GS readers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">This research is a qualitative one. The main focus is to review the GS text. To find a maximum output, there are four approaches applied in integrated one: objective-mimetic-expressive-pragmatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are two kinds of data source: (1) Primary data source is GS text; (2). Secondary data source in term of books and interview output where the text is relevant to this research. The data is collected through library study, observation and interview with a number of informants who are considered understanding GS. The researcher is the key instrument. In the meanwhile data analysis is conducted using </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">heutistic</span><span class="font1"> method namely ‘an analysis based on language competence’, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hermeneutic</span><span class="font1"> ‘an analysis based on literary and culture competences. The analysis outputs are presented in descriptive one.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aesthetic Understanding of Geguritan Sucita:</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Through literature study, it is known that GS is a developing works. It means the GS text has additional for total verses, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pupuh</span><span class="font1"> and melody from the first publication in 1960s to next publication in 1980s. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pupuh</span><span class="font1"> is initially at 37 develops into 57 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pupuh</span><span class="font1">; melody from 10 to be 11; and verses from 1,217 (Balimas publication in 1961) into 1,877 verses (Kayumas publication in 1982). The title is also different: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geguritan Sucita, Geguritan Sucita/Subudi</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geguritan Sucita Muah Suvudhi</span><span class="font1">. It is also known that the existence of GS spread widely in society which is sufficiently determined by creative readers: I Ketut Repet and I Putu Astra Lokika. In addition, it is also known that a number of literary text and religion of other Jlantik’s work. Those which are published instead of GS, namely </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aji Sangkya, Geguritan Lokika</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Satwa Men Tingkes</span><span class="font1">. In the meanwhile those which are not published are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gurindam Gonika</span><span class="font1">, a text of radio broadcasting entitles </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Terjemahan Wrēhaspati Tattwa, Terjemahan Saracamuscaya</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bebasan Bhỉsma Parwa</span><span class="font1">. It is also similar to Repet’s works. Those which are published are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geguritan Sarascamuscaya</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">geguritan Nitisastra</span><span class="font1">. While those which have not published yet are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geguritan Puputan Margarana</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geguritan Yudeng Margarana</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geguritan Darma Pada</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">GS as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gita puja</span><span class="font1">. GS is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gita puja</span><span class="font1"> of Ida Ketut Jlantik (1905-1961) offered to God Almighty through entertainment, education and suggestion to society readers. As worship song, GS is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sekar</span><span class="font1"> ‘flowers offering in wisdom language’ in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kepara</span><span class="font1"> Balinese language enriched by Old Javanese language, thus at certain rhyme has archaic image.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The structure of GS is modified according to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kavya</span><span class="font1"> principle, namely a principle of Indian literature that has be implemented in Java during Hindu period (9-15 century) as the guidance in writing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kakawin</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kidung</span><span class="font1">. Jlantik seems to compose using emanation principle: sustainable spirit in shape modification. For Jlantik, the works of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kawi</span><span class="font1"> (Old Javanese) is a reference ones, both in term of formation and content. Through this inspiration, Jlantik then works in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kawi-wiku </span><span class="font1">idealism. He quotes and composes the esthetic-religious idea obtained from his meditation in deeply learning about the above Hindu literature. It is then creatively listed in pattern of Balinese traditional literature: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sekar alit</span><span class="font1"> which is popular in 1950s. For this reason, the principle of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kavya</span><span class="font1"> is a motivated esthetic guidance in establishing formal structure and narrative of GS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The creative principle of Jlantik is a pray and work according to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bhakti-karma-jnana-yoga</span><span class="font1"> having the meaning that work and the output of work are dedicated for society happiness in sincere one. For him, his works are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">‘sekar’ </span><span class="font1">‘flower of offering’. So that is why, the works must be composed of selected wisdom flowers in order to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lengut kaput melah</span><span class="font1"> ‘beauty within kindness’. As presented in such a way, Jlantik hopes the readers can have </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rasa anyar</span><span class="font1"> ‘a new emotion from old idea’ that make their life bright.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In idealism above, formal structure of GS is established to fill the pattern of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sekar alit: padalingsa</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sinom</span><span class="font1"> is the favourite </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tembang</span><span class="font1"> having its objective that the rhyme of GS supports the spirit of what being transformed. The election of rhyme content follows </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kakawin</span><span class="font1"> structure; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manggala</span><span class="font1">-corpus-epilog to be constructed of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bhawacakra</span><span class="font1"> ‘circle’ pattern: rhymes of GS as of like a necklace of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sanwacana</span><span class="font1"> ‘wise discourse’ to be composes in such a way according to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">alamkara </span><span class="font1">‘stylistic’ so the rhyme and rhythm have euphony religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the meanwhile the narrative structure of GS is composed on deductive idea in narrative unit pattern of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sandhi</span><span class="font1">. For this narration, it relates </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rasa</span><span class="font1"> that can be enjoyed by concentrating attention to relation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vibhdva</span><span class="font1"> ‘mood, background and emotion’ - </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">anubhdva</span><span class="font1"> ‘figure expression and discourse’ - </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vybhicaribhdva</span><span class="font1"> ‘a rising emotion due to enjoying the relationship between v</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ibhdva</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">anubhdva</span><span class="font1">’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the sake of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sandhi</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">aguron-guron</span><span class="font1"> system is selected as text matrix by developing the plot seed of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kdma</span><span class="font1"> ‘desire’ and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tirtayatra</span><span class="font1"> ‘holy trip’. Good </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kdma</span><span class="font1"> is symbolized to be the main figure in story under the name of Sang Sucita. While </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tirtayatra</span><span class="font1"> plot having </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dharma</span><span class="font1"> discourse is personalized as the main figure under the name of Sang Subudi. The idea of Jlantik that good emotion and wise intellectual, if it is synergized, can cause people having </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">karuna</span><span class="font1"> ‘feeling of pity’ and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">moksa</span><span class="font1"> ‘happiness’. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Moksa</span><span class="font1"> is the ultimate peak obtained by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jenek</span><span class="font1"> attitude ‘silence in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">yoga</span><span class="font1"> definition’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In contrast, bad </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kdma</span><span class="font1"> appears to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ahangkara</span><span class="font1"> ‘anger emotion’. These characters are symbolized as antagonist characters under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">I Pataka </span><span class="font1">‘the source of misfortune’ as he has a friend of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">I Durbudi</span><span class="font1"> “bad thinking’. Based on principle of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">karma</span><span class="font1">, the bad action has the effect to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">punarbhawa</span><span class="font1"> ‘people are trapped in repeated suffer’. So that is why, Jlantik suggests to GS readers to follow their idol character, Sucita-Subudi. Having good attitude within idea and thought, the people are believed to be able to overcome suffer and they can reach their wise life.</span></p>
