<p><span class="font1">character is not real but it is inspired by reality. The character usually related to us in the reality, it can have the similar personality or condition in real life.

Acording to Egri, Human has three dimensions: physiology, sociology, and psychology. The three dimension also can be applied on analysing character in a story. Physiology is talking about the appearance of the character, it about how the character looks, their age, their gender, height, weight, posture defect and heredity. Sociology is related with the social life condition of the character such as social class, the occupation (the type of work, hours of work, income, condition of work, attitude toward org anization, suitability for work), education, the home life of the character, religion, race, nationality, place in community, political affiliations, amusements, and hobbies.

<p><span class="font1">(Carl slams the door.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to the conversations between Carl and the construction foreman Tom on data 9, it can be concluded that Carl is a stubborn person. The quotation “</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">When I'm dead!” </span><span class="font1">here means that Carl does not want to sell the house. The other proof that Carl is stubborn is when Carl still keeps trying to fulfill his promise to Ellie although he already faces many problems on his way to Paradise Falls (It can be seen on data 10).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Data 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">(Carl hits the worker with his cane. He falls to the sidewalk.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The other proof that Carl is a short tempered is that Carl is easily annoyed by Russell, Dug, and Kevin.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl is a smart person</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Carl is a smart person, when Russell refuses to leave Carl’s house, he does a trick to make Carl leave from his house. He tells Russell a fake story about snipe, a bird with beady eyes that sneaks his yard and gobbles his azaleas every night. He tells Russell to find it.

<p><span class="font1">CARL: </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">You ever heard of a snipe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUSSELL: Snipe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">CARL: </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas. I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it. If only someone could help me -</span><span class="font1">RUSSELL: Me Me I'll do it</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">CARL: Oh, I don't know</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, it's awfully crafty. You'd have to clap your hands three times to lure it in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUSSELL: I'll find it, Mr. Fredricksen</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">CARL</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">: I think its burrow is two blocks down. If you go past </span><span class="font1">-</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Russell runs down the block clapping and calling. RUSSELL: Sniiiipe Here Snipey Snipey -CARL: </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bring it back here when you find it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides that Carl also tricks Dug and Kevin to make them stay away from him. When Carl knows that Dug likes ball, he has an idea to make Dug leave him. He takes a tennis ball which is on the bottom of his cane, and then he throws it away. After seeing it, Dug follows the ball (It can be seen on data 15). Carl also does a similar trick on the bird (Kevin). He throws a bar of chocolate away, and then the bird followed it. Carl grabs Russell and run from there. (It can be seen on data 16).</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl is a nice person</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Although Carl is a short tempered-person, deep inside Carl is a nice person. He cares about Russell, he tries to save Russell when Muntz captures Russell. It shows in the dialog between him and Russell:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Data 17</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">(1:17:42 – 1:17:50).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Russell: you came back for kevin Let’s go get her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Carl : I’m getting Kevin. You stay here</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Russell: But I want to help</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Carl : </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I don’t want your help. I want you safe</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The dialog from the last line of data 17, “</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I don’t want your help. I want you safe </span><span class="font1">” proves that Carl cares about Russell’s safety. Carl wants Russell to stay at the house in order to avoid bad things that might happen to him. Besides that, in the movie Russell also says that Carl is a nice person when Kevin wants to attack Carl:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Data 18</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">(38:33 – 38:39)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUSSELL: Uh-oh No no no no no Kevin, it's okay. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Fredricksen is nice</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the quotation from data 18, the quotation “</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Fredricksen is nice</span><span class="font1">” it can be concluded that according to Russell’s perspective, Carl is a good person. Although sometimes Carl is angry with Russell, Russell knows that Carl actually is a nice person. He helps him many times and also listens to his story.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
