In order to design of machine or building constructions use of welding connection there are many factors should beconsidered such as skill knowledge about welding procedures and material characteristics One parameter of weldingprocedures influencing mechanical characteristic of weld metal is welding current In this study strength of aluminium 1100welding connection due to electric current variations at metal inert gas welding process was investigated Spesimen
