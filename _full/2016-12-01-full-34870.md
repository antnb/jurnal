<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Semiotik dapat didefinisikan sebagai ilmu tentang sistem tanda. Semiotik bertujuan untuk mengetahui makna-makna yang terkandung dalam sebuah tanda atau menafsirkan makna tersebut sehingga diketahui bagaimana komunikator mengkonstruksi pesan. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mendeskripsikan makna verbal dan visual yang terdapat dalam lagu kebangsaan dan bendera United States dan United Kingdom. Data dikumpulkan melalui proses membaca dan mencatat lalu menganalisis data berdasarkan teori yang digunakan. Terdapat tiga jenis makna pada masing-masing lagu kebangsaan berdasarkan teori dari Leech (1974) dan empat elemen visual pada kedua bendera berdasarkan teori dari Berger (1984) dan Wierzbicka (1996). Selain itu terdapat hubungan semiotik antara masing-masing lagu kebangsaan dan benderanya.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kata Kunci: makna verbal, makna visual, hubungan semiotik.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of The Study</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The United States and United Kingdom are the powerful and influential countries in the world. Together, they have given the English language a dominant role in many sectors of the modern world. The United States shares with United Kingdom many threads of cultural heritage. Since English is the language of both the British and the Americans, both nations belong to the English-speaking world. However, the common language does come with differences in spelling, pronunciation, and the meaning of words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The United Kingdom and United States national anthems have similarities between them. Both of the national anthems have long lyrics but only sung in the short verse. Besides , another similarity of them is the same color of their flags. Blue, red and white are the colors of United Kingdom and United States flags. Halliday (1985) argued that semiotics can be defined as the study of sign systems. It is an aspect of the study of meaning. Halliday intended a more specific interpretation of the word ‘social’ to indicate the relationships between language and social structure, considering the social structure as one aspect of the social system. Halliday (1978) proposed some essential ingredients or elements in a social semiotics theory of language. There are the text, the situation, the text variety or register, the code, the linguistic system, and the social structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Relevant with Halliday, Leech (1977) states, the word ‘meaning’ and its corresponding verb ‘to mean’ are among the most ambiguous and controversial terms in the theory of language. Related to the anthem lyrics, this study tried to find the meaning of United States and United Kingdom anthem.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The data in this study are anthems and flags of United States and United Kingdom. The anthems are national anthems of United States and United Kingdom. A[part from the anthem of both countries, the primary data of this study are the flags of United States and United Kingdom. Both of the countries were chosen as the primary data because they are the biggest countries in the world. They also have similarities in regard to the colors in their flags.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Collecting Data</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In collecting the data, the library research and documentation methods were applied. Library research was used to collect the data of United States and United Kingdom. Firstly, the written lyrics of anthem and flag’s picture of United States and United Kingdom were searched and collected. Then, audio visual of the anthems was searched on the internet. Next, deep information about the data was searched from the internet, books and online articles and journal. While collecting the data, note-taking was adopted.

<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Analyzing Data</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The collected data were analyzed descriptively using the qualitative method. The theories used in analyzing data were the theory of Meaning by Leech (1974) and the theory of Visual Aspect of Sign by Berger (1984). The analysis of this study took several steps. First, the information on the historical background of the two countries were collected. Then, the selected information was noted as data research. The data were analyzed according to the theory used in this study. Next, the meaning inside the anthem’s lyrics of United States and United Kingdom was presented. Last, the visual aspects that appeared on both flags of United States and United Kingdom were described.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Verbal Message of “The Star Spangled Banners” Anthem Lyrics First Part:</span></p></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Oh, say! can you see by the dawn's early light</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first part of the anthem’s lyrics reflects thematic meaning because the American wants to emphasize the existence of the flag during the war. Leech (1974:19) states that thematic meaning is what is communicated by the way in which a speaker or writer organizes the message, in terms of ordering, focus, and emphasis. Line two and four have intonation in the words “What so proudly” and “O’er the ramparts” to emphasize the information.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Second Part:</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Oh, say! does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second part of the anthem’s lyric is conceptual meaning because the lyric represents the chorus of the anthem’s lyric and it shows a condition in the middle of war. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Third Part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In fully glory reflected now shines in the stream:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The third part of anthem’s lyrics is conceptual meaning because the American literary tells about condition in the middle of war.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Fourth Part:</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh, long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fourth part reflects thematic meaning because the American wants to emphasize the power of the United States flag.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Fifth Part:</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">And where is that band who so vauntingly swore</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A home and a country should leave us no more?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fifth part of the anthem’s lyrics is affective meaning because the American describes their feeling of the war and condition of the effect of war.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Sixth Part:</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The sixth part of the anthem’s lyric is conceptual meaning because the lyric meaning represents the chorus of the anthem’s lyric.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Seventh Part:</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Oh, thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Between their loved home and the war's desolation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: &quot;In God is our trust&quot;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This part of anthem’s lyrics is conceptual meaning and it shows a condition of the end of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Eighth Part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The eighth part of the anthem’s lyric is conceptual meaning because the lyrics meaning represents the chorus of the anthem’s lyric and literary tells the condition in the middle of war.</span></p>
