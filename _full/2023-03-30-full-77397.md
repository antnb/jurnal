<p><span class="font5">Financial bootstrapping is a creative and non-conventional financing strategy by MSME actors to reduce dependence on external funding sources. This study aims to describe the implementation of the bootstrap financing method in obtaining a source of capital for MSMEs running the ikat weaving businesses. Using the samples of 167 ikat business owners in the district of Kambera of the regency of Sumba Timur in the province of Nusa Tenggara, this study used quantitative descriptive analysis techniques. The results show that ikat businesses use bootstrap financing strategies, including independent funding of the owners (including borrowed or invested funds from relatives), receivables management, sharing resources with other businesses, delaying payments to protect cash, and making use of subsidies. From the six indicators of bootstrap financing, the study found that the ikat businesses do not implement one strategy regarding inventory management</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have played a critical role in developing the economy. In the Indonesian context, MSMEs have contributed to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP); and have survived the global monetary crisis. Additionally, MSMEs have also absorbed numerous workforces in the country. According to the data from the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs of The Republic of Indonesia (Kementrian Koperasi dan Usaha Kecil dan Menengah Republik Indonesia), there were 64.194.056 MSMEs in 2018, which were classified into the following details: 63.350.222 micro businesses, 783.132 small businesses, and 60.702 medium businesses. This data shows an increasing number compared to the previous year, which was 62.922.617. In other words, the business has experienced a significant increase of 2.02%. The record also shows that the business units have absorbed 97% of the total 116.978.631 workforce (Kementrian Koperasi dan Usaha Kecil dan Menengah Republik Indonesia, 2018). On 31 December 2019, the Office of Cooperatives Manpower and Transmigration (Nakertrans) of NTT province recorded 104.188 MSMEs (Tuames, 2019).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The data shows that MSMEs have played a crucial role in Indonesian economic development because they provide employment for the community and become the source of earnings for low-income groups of people (Ratnawati &amp;&nbsp;Hikmah, 2012). MSMEs have also been the means for the community to meet their daily needs. Despite their potential, MSMEs are facing several challenges, including capital (Mazzarol &amp;&nbsp;Reboud, 2017), human resources (Saini &amp;&nbsp;Budhwar, 2008), relatively low education level (Efrata &amp;&nbsp;Herdinata, 2012), and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">issues related to business management. TThis study is going to focus on capital problems because they have become the main issue faced by MSMEs in developing countries, such as Indonesia (Ebben, 2009; Nguyen &amp;&nbsp;Nghiem, 2016; Rao et al., 2019).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the indicators to determine a progressive business is its performance. In other words, a thriving business always keeps its performance by generating high income and obtaining profits larger than the expenses. The government expects that a region can increase its economic potential through the entrepreneurial community that utilizes local resources so local funding is well-absorbed and useful (Hendriyanto, 2015).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Financial bootstrapping</span><span class="font7"> was first coined by Auken (2005), who stated that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">bootstrapping</span><span class="font7"> is favorable because of some reasons: 1) accessible source of funds, 2) ease of use, and 3) less complicated requirements. Further, Rita (2019) suggests that the creative funding strategy and non-conventional funding sources may help MSME actors to reduce their dependence on external funding. The goal of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">financial bootstrapping</span><span class="font7"> is to help MSME actors enhance their businesses without the burden of the high cost of bank interest rates. Winborg &amp;&nbsp;Landström (2001) categorize financial bootstrapping into six indicators: 1) independent funding from the owners, including borrowed or invested funds from relatives, 2) minimizing accounts receivable, 3) sharing resources with other businesses, 4) delaying payments to protect cash, 5) inventory management, 6) making use of subsidies. The method </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font7"> financial bootstrapping is favorable to help MSMEs grow sustainably and create competitive excellence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Based on the record, there are 4.830 employments in the existing 2.741 MSMEs in the Regency of Sumba Timur of the Nusa Tenggara Timur province (BPS Kabupaten Sumba Timur, 2020). The data shows that most of the MSMEs in the area are working in the traditional </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> weaving business. They are spread in two districts, namely Kambera, the largest center of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> weaving; and Umalulu, the center for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">songket</span><span class="font7"> weaving. This study uses MSME actors in the Kambera district as respondents. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ikat</span><span class="font7"> is one of the local businesses in the Regency of Sumba Timur that still preserves its tradition regarding the production process. Therefore, the existence, operation, and sustainability of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business are influenced by capital availability. Regrettably, similar to other MSMEs, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> entrepreneurs in the area are facing challenges in obtaining capital to run the business. Pakereng (2017), found that capital is a classic problem faced by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> businesses in the Regency of Sumba Timur; thus, the businesses hardly grow. For that reason, this study aims to analyze the use of bootstrap financing by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> businesses in the district of Kambera in the regency of Sumba to obtain capital for their businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is common to find small businesses, especially private enterprises, face challenges in making financial decisions. Obstacles include practices of mixing business and personal goals, taxes, and personal or two-way transactions. Previous studies confirmed that maximizing wealth is not the main objective of small enterprises (Watson &amp;&nbsp;Wilson, 2002). Information asymmetry, high transaction costs, credit rationing, and bad credit ranking, have also impeded MSMEs from obtaining capital. Further, MSME owners may: a) need external funding, but they are limited (Winborg &amp;&nbsp;Landström, 2001), b) choose not to seek business credit, and c) opt for using internal funding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Researches show that the preference of entrepreneurs has a significant impact on their capital gain. Watson &amp;&nbsp;Wilson, (2002) argue that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">pecking order framework</span><span class="font7"> (POF) is useful in understanding the capital acquisition of a business. They also found that POF is suitable for small businesses because of the owner-manager practices. Besides capital,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">financial resources from personal asset support from friends and relatives, amenities, credibilities, and reputations, are valuable elements to help MSMEs grow (Bhide &amp;&nbsp;Stevenson, 1992). Financial resources that are outside the financial structure of traditional enterprises are included in the integrated financing. Among informal resources, business owners usually have the highest preference for trade credits, which is then followed by the preference for having financial support from friends and relatives, and creditors. Meanwhile, external equity is usually the least preferred (Kent Baker et al., 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A successful entrepreneur must be able to address any challenges in creative ways. It begins with the way they obtain resources to run the business. Since funding is the most critical resource for MSMEs, entrepreneurs are required to seek for alternatives fundings to reduce their dependence on external parties. A well-known method of alternative funding is financial bootstrapping</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font7"> It refers to a process where business owners collect funding resources without relying on debts, equity funding from banks, or external investors (Vanacker, 2011). According to Barra &amp;&nbsp;Zotti (2016); Rita (2019), financial bootstrapping is a creative funding strategy and non-conventional funding sources to reduce dependence on external funding. The strategies can support MSMEs in developing their businesses without the burden of the high cost of bank interest rates. Although it is common to find small and medium entrepreneurs are having problems obtaining traditional funding resources such as bank loans and capital markets, financial institutions do not seem to see the opportunities. There are not many financial institutions providing financial support to growing small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Hence, SMEs have limited access to and little trust in traditional finances (Bhide &amp;&nbsp;Stevenson, 1992). Dwelling on the problems, MSMEs are prone to bankruptcy because they are not able to collect direct or indirect funding. This is in line with the results of previous studies that found a correlation between a lack of funding and business failures (Carter &amp;&nbsp;Van Auken, 2005).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The inability of financial institutions to provide support to MSMEs may be caused by information asymmetry and the theory between MSMEs and financial institutions. As one of the financial institutions, a bank may expect entrepreneurs to have adequate knowledge of banking requirements. However, it is frequent to find that the MSMEs cannot meet the requirements (Vanacker 2011). This study is going to investigate the implementation of bootstrap financing by MSMEs, especially in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> businesses.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Using a quantitative method, this study used numbers for data collection, data interpretation, and result presentation. Begun with a common theory, the study then described it deductively. The theory's validity was tested through observations before concluding. Eventually, the study described the data to find solutions to the problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The object of this research was MSMEs running </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> businesses in the district of Kambera in the regency of Sumba Timur or Nusa Tenggara Timur province. They are chosen as the respondents because this district is the largest </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> industries in the area. As it is suggested by (Sekaran &amp;&nbsp;Bougie, 2016), the population of the research is not only humans, but it includes objects and other natural objects. Populations are not only related to numbers, but also all characteristics or characteristics related to objects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Using purposive sampling, the final samples in this study were 167 respondents, who were chosen using criteria. Samples were those who are: 1) owners of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> industries residing and running their business in the district of Kambera; 2) having the businesses run for at least</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">3 years (because bootstrap financing was used in pre-existing businesses, not the new ones); and 3) orienting the industries for pure business, not personal use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As for data, this study used primary data through questionnaires. Data were collected with the support of enumerators, who are students living in the area. Analysis was performed in a quantitative-descriptive manner using tables and diagrams then described them descriptively before making conclusions (Anderson et al., 2017). Finally, data processing was performed through four steps. First, questionnaires were scrutinized to minimize errors. The second was coding. In this step, the researchers coded each response to allow smooth analysis. The coding mechanism was 1 – agree to the provided statement to 0 – disagree. The third step was moving the required data (numbers) into tables and then classifying the data into six categories of bootstrap financing. As a final step, the researchers descriptively analyzed data in tables and graphs to draw conclusions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Since it is a quantitative study, the result was in numeric data, which was then descriptively analyzed. The study aims to investigate how MSMEs in the district of Kambera in the regency of Sumba Timur implement bootstrap financing for their initial finance. Questionnaires were used to collect data from 167 respondents. The questionnaires contained six indicators of bootstrap financing, namely independent funding from the owner’s savings (including borrowed or invested funds from relatives), minimizing accounts receivable, sharing resources with other businesses, delaying payments to protect cash, and making use of subsidies. It was found that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> businesses do not implement the strategy for inventory management. Characteristics of the respondents were used to get information about their background in running the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business. The characteristics, which include sex, age, education level, and the period of running the business, are presented as follows:</span></p>

The result shows that the owners of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> businesses in the district of Kambera are dominated by females. The reason for this result is that in the area, men are working as farmers, thus, weaving is a task mostly performed by women.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Table 4 shows that the owners of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> industries have run their businesses for more than five years. It is not surprising because </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> weaving in Sumba Timur is a tradition that has been handed down over generations, so the business is not new in the area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Regarding funding resources, it is found that 99% of respondents agree that the initial funding used to establish the business was from personal funding. Concerning the funding contribution from families and relatives, 72% disagree that the families and relatives give a contribution to the business. This means that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business owners are self-reliant. The finding is relevant to the result of the International Labour Office (2019) finding that business owners in Indonesia dominantly use personal funding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In general, owners can rely on personal savings because </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> businesses do not require a large amount of funding. It is because of several reasons. First, since the weaving tradition has been the legacy over generations, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business performers do not need to pay for any training. Second, the weaving process uses self-made traditional instruments; thus, people do not need to buy them. Families and relatives usually give their support voluntarily either in the form of money or weaving instruments. Based on the findings, 99% of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> owners use personal funding. It shows that they apply the first indicator of bootstrap financing</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font7"> This result is contrasting with a previous study by Prahasiwi &amp;&nbsp;Mildawati (2019), where they found that MSME actors tend to rely on bank loans. A previous study that yielded a similar result to the present finding was from Radja (2018), finding that a major number of MSMEs' funding is</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">either from personal assets, savings, donations from families and relatives, or business profit. This finding is also relevant to the capital structure theory, where </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">bootstrap financing</span><span class="font7"> is one part of the pecking order theory. The notion suggests that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business owners prefer internal instead of external funding to minimize future risks.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Source: Processed data, 2021</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Regarding the second indicator of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">bootstrap financing</span><span class="font7">, which is receivables management, 87% of respondents agree that they need a relatively short time to pay loans. A high score in this indicator shows that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business owners in the district of Kambera prefer to give their customers a short period to pay the receivables. The main reason is that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> weaving in Sumba Timur is highly expensive, where each </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> may cost up to 3 million Indonesian rupiahs. The lengthy process required to produce ikat also makes it risky for the business owner to accept down payments and give long-term loans. The result of this indicator is in line with the findings of Auken (2005) and Wasiuzzaman &amp;&nbsp;Nurdin (2019). They found that higher-risk businesses have higher possibilities of implementing bootstrap financing. In contrast, lower-risk businesses have a higher chance to the traditional funding resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seen from the use of amenities (weaving machines, tools, and other instruments), 93% of respondents agree that the amenities can be shared with other family members who might also own </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> businesses. In Sumba Timur, it is common to find 3 to 4 members in a family doing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> weaving. Although usually each of them owns their machine, tool, and other</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">instruments, the amenities are shared among family members in case someone’s amenity has malfunctioned. The result of this indicator is in line with Rita (2019) who suggests that a creative funding category includes the joint use of amenities. The strategy aims to reduce dependency on external funding resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With regards to the next indicator, which is payment delay, only 25% of the respondents agree to delay payment to protect their cash. This means that most </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business owners do not prefer to delay payments. The cause of this finding is related to the affordable cost of yarns and threads, which are the materials required for the weaving process. The price of these items is still reasonable for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business owners to buy in cash. Although the number of respondents who agree to delay payment to protect their cash was relatively low (25%), it shows that the pecking order theory has played a role in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business (Baker et al., 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the inventory management indicator, 31% of the respondents agree, and 69% disagree that they are making purchases based on necessities. Related to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> production</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font7"> 90% of respondents disagree, and 10% agree that they produce </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> by order. The result is understandable because </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> entrepreneurs in Sumba Timur usually produce their </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> continuously. It means, they do not only weave based on orders but make more </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> as a supply in case customers desire to repurchase. The result is in line with the last discussion of down payment, in which </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business owners do not accept front money before they finish the weaving process. The practice has caused them the risk of having relatively limited funds to buy the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> materials. Therefore, perceived from inventory management, there is a low percentage of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business owners in the district of Kambera who apply bootstrap financing because they do not seem to minimize the inventory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Regarding subsidy utilization, 78% of the respondents received subsidies from the regional government, while 12% did not. The result represents that the regional-government of Sumba Timur has shown its support for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business. The subsidies provided are usually not in form of cash. The government helps businesses by providing yarns and threads. The study found that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business owners have benefited from the subsidies for the last 1 year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to the findings of six indicators of bootstrap financing to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> MSMEs, it is found that they do not tend to rely on external funding. Instead, they prefer internal funding resources through bootstrap financing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span class="font7">trategies. The findings validate the pecking order theory (Auken, 2005; Rasheed &amp;&nbsp;Siddiqui, 2019). Furthermore, bootstrap financing strategies have also been favorable for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> entrepreneurs, as startup businesses, to grow their ventures (Miao et al., 2017; Michiels &amp;&nbsp;Molly, 2017).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>CONCLUSIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Bootstrap financing is an effective alternative to reduce the dependency of MSMEs, including the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business, on external funding such as loans. The financing strategy can help a business be independent and prevent them from any potential risks. Additionally, bootstrap financing may stimulate the growth of new </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Based on the results and discussions, it can be concluded that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business owners in the district of Kambera in the regency of Sumba Timur, apply four </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">bootstrap </span><span class="font7">financing strategies, i.e., 1) independent funding from the owner (including borrowed or invested funds from relatives); 2)sharing resources with other businesses; 3) delaying payments to protect cash; 4) making use of subsidies. However, the result shows that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> businesses do not implement the strategy of inventory management and receivables</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">management. Bootstrap financing should have been an effective solution to capital gain if all six indicators are met, but the findings show that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business owners have not used all of the strategies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the result found that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ikat</span><span class="font7"> business owners in the district of Kambera have not managed their inventories, it calls for attention either from the regional government or higher education institutions to provide additional support. Therefore, the recommendation is to organize training or seminar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For future studies, it may be required to determine whether a process or treatment affects the population of interest. It is recommended to investigate the implementation of bootstrap financing using different analysis methods, such as the T-test and F-test, to better insight into the bootstrap financing benefits on MSMEs.</span></p>
