<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>ABSTRACT</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Derivation of the name of typical Minahasa food and beverage is a change or replacement of the word class of verbs, adverbs, and adjectives into nouns. It occurs through the process of compounding, affixation, and reduplication. Free morpheme which appears is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ransak, tei, tu'tu, tape, segor, sende ', rica, fresh, rukus</span><span class="font1">. Conversely, some morphemes or bound forms (affixes) are the prefix /pe-/,/wa-/, and /</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ko-</span><span class="font1">/ ; infix /-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font1">-/ ; suffix </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">/-en</span><span class="font1">/, and confixes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">/-in- + -an</span><span class="font1">/ and /</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ka- + -an</span><span class="font1">/ . Prefixes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">/pe-/,</span><span class="font1"> /</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wa</span><span class="font1">-/, and /</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ko</span><span class="font1">-/ ; infix /-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in-</span><span class="font1">/ ; sufi </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">x-en/,</span><span class="font1"> andconfixes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">/-in- + -an</span><span class="font1">/ occur in the formation of derivational words of food, while drinks contain two morphemes (affixes), the infix / -in- / and confix (ka + -an). Thus, the derivation of the typical Minahasa food naming is called derivational affixes such as derivational prefix, infix, and confix. Meanwhile, derivational infix, and confix occur in a typical Minahasa drink. Empty derivation is not found in the typical Minahasa food and beverage since a single form, for example, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pangi, sa’ut, paniki, kawok,</span><span class="font1"> dan </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sopi</span><span class="font1"> have a meaning that does not change the word class. In addition, the characteristics of the structure of itscompounding: root + base (base + roots), that have a sense of the endocentric and exocentric compound words. Endocentric ompounding is the most frequent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Keywords</span><span class="font1">: derivation, affixation, compounding, reduplication, endocentric and exocentric.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The typical Minahasa food and drinks is aculture that is still durable and sustainable in the province of North Sulawesi. They appear as vocabulary of names considered as a meaningful form of preservation of language and culture in North Sulawesi, which distinguishes it from other cultures. In addition, the degradation of the use of local languages in Minahasa that leads to the lost of local language displaced by the use of Manado Malay language is a phenomenon and the fact happening in the Minahasa region and North Sulawesi. In this connection, the solution to preserve the language is found in the rise of the typical Minahasa food and drink vocabulary. The empirical fact stated that the names of the food and drink of Minahasa appear as a noun functioning multidimensionally in diversity in the lives of Minahasa people in the era of globalization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Linguistically, the derivation is a word formation process which appears at the naming of typical Minahasa food and beverage. Minahasa has some local or regional languages used by the community including Tontemboan, Tombulu, Tonsea, and Tondano become the basis for revealing the formation of words in naming Minahasa food and beverages. The naming of typicalMinahasa foods and drinks that brings shape variation is not based on administrative territory but the use of local languages in Minahasa. Morphological processes that generate the derivation needs to be examined in depth to determine how the form of the name or words of Minahasa food and drink which results in the form of lexical variation in local languages in Minahasa. It gave rise to variations in the form of typical Minahasa food and beverage names as manifest in their lexical gaps or overlap in the study of culture and language. The study should be observed through</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">morphological approach especially morphological processes such as the formation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of words, the derivation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vocabulary of the typical Minahasa food and beverage appears as a noun word class types as a result of the process of word class change of the verb, adjective, or adverb. Therefore, the formation of words that occurs, ie, the derivation of the verb, adjective, or adverb into a noun. Meanwhile, derivational prefix, infix, dsuffixes, and derivational konfiks (combination of affixes) appears on derivational process. Morphological process is a process of combining morphemes into words. Morpheme is the smallest form, while the largest is the word. The process consists of morphological affixation, reduplication, supplition, and empty modification (Samsuri, 1997). This is in accordance with the statement of Leech (1968) which states that modern grammar consists of three parts, namely inflection, derivation (word formation), and syntax. Derivation is part of morphology. Derivation lists the process of forming new words from existing words (or root, base). Derivation is different construction than the base distribution. Complicated construction is the result of merger between two or more morphemes. Aronoff and Fudeman (2005) state that the derivation involves the creation of one lexeme to another lexeme, eg selector or selecton of select. Dervasional process consists of compounding, empty derivation, affixation, and reduplication. Vocabulary as the typical Minahasa food and beverage names appear as a noun word class as a result of the process of word class change of the verb, adjective, or adverb.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">This study was based on field linguistic-synchronous research to describe the formation of words that appear as the name of typical Minahasa food and beverage. The method used to obtain the data is uninvolved observation (Bungin, 2007: 57; Moleong, 2000) which was supported by recording and note taking techniques (Bungin, 2003; Sudaryanto, 1993: 25). Later, in-depth interview method was also applied in particular to obtain information.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Lexical form of the name of typical Minahasa food and beverages can be observed through morphological and syntactic theory. Morphological theory is used to view the process of merging of the morphemes into words. Meanwhile, syntactic theory is used to see the combination of words as a phrase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The name of typical food and drink as the affixed word can be divided again into the root experiencing affixation in the form of a prefix, infix, and suffix. From the theory of morphology, especially the theory of word formation (affixation) the form of word includes the derivational verbs, the adjectives, or adverbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vocabulary of Minahasa food and beverage names appear as a noun resulting from the process of word class change of the verb, adjective, or adverb. Therefore, in the word formation a derivation occurs from verb, adjective, or adverb into a noun. Vocabularies that undergo word class changes from verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tinoransak</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">posana</span><span class="font1">, kinetor, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sinegor</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kasegaran, pedaal, peraal, tinape, tinu'tuan, pinaraci, kotei, warukus, bobengka,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kokole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the vocabulary, it appears that the root as the base is a different word class that appears as the name of typical Minahasa food and beverage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Food and beverages constitute or include the countless noun (mass nouns). Food and drinks can be calculated if it is given an article in the form of a number for example, one plate, one portion. Accordingly, the food and drinks at the Minahasa community named by reference </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">talun</span><span class="font1"> 'forest' and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">uma</span><span class="font1"> 'garden' are based on cognition or convention of the Minahasa community as a cultural concept to be observed as a noun on the linguistic level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The process of word formation coming from the word class of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs into a noun which is considered as a derivation can be described as follows..</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Derivational processes in the typical Minahasa food and drink vocabulary name consists of compounding, affixation, and reduplication.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The explanation of word formation by insertion </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">-in-</span><span class="font1"> is as follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Word formation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tinoransak</span><span class="font1"> can be observed in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">-in-</span><span class="font1"> insertion to the words </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ransak</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tou</span><span class="font1"> 'person'.
