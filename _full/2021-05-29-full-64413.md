<p><span class="font0">Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a process to identify words or phrases as a named entity, such as a person, location, time expression, or organization. In this research, we are interested in developing a NER which able to identify the time expression entity in Balinese text documents. The time expression entity becomes an important component in the text because it is usually followed by important facts and information. NER was built using a rules-based approach. The rules are built based on direct observation of documents and pay attention to the morphological and contextual structures. Based on the experiments conducted, the average results of the precision, recall, and f-measure values were 0.85, 0.87, and 0.85.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Indonesia is a rich country with cultural diversity. Each region in Indonesia has its cultural characteristics. One form of Indonesian cultural diversity is regional languages. In 2017, Indonesia has 652 regional languages [1]. Balinese is one of the regional languages of Indonesia. The use of Balinese is still maintained and actively used in various aspects of life such as communication, customs, religion, education, and even the media. Balinese is categorized as a major regional language because it has a large number of speakers, a written system, and a literary tradition [2].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rapid development of technology and information is in line with the amount of availability of Balinese text documents in digital format. Besides, the need for fast and accurate information also increases. However, a lot of important information is still scattered in narrative documents, so it can take a long time to find it. One way to find this important information is by using NER.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a derivative of information extraction (IE). Information extraction (IE) is the process of finding information from a document or natural language with the results in the form of structured information in a certain format. The purpose of NER is to recognize and identify named entities and classify them into predetermined categories [3]. The named entity can be a person, location, organization, time expression, and others. NER also has an important role in various natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as text understanding, information retrieval, automatic text summarization, question answering, machine translation, and knowledge base construction [4].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">NER has three general approaches to use, there are the rule-based method, the learning-based method, or the hybrid approach [5]. The rule-based approach relies on the rules and patterns of named entities contained in sentences and is defined manually using regular expressions based on linguistic knowledge and entity characteristics [6], [7], [8]. Linguistic knowledge can include grammar, contextual, lexicon, and algorithms to determine each of the operations involved [6].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Several studies related to NER have been carried out using various methods in various languages. However, research related to NER for Balinese has never been done before. In</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">research [9], the authors constructed NER by using a set of rules by combining contextual, morphological, and part-of-speech knowledge. NER is built for Indonesian. The evaluation is done by calculating the precision, recall, and f-measure values with the results of 63.63% recall and 71.84% precision. These results outperform those obtained using the maximum entropy method and associated rule-based method. Research [6], built a NER that able to identify entities in the biomedical domain using rule-based and Naïve Bayes classifiers. 18 rules are built based on observations on training data. The results obtained in this study are the highest average value of precision, recall, and f-measure is 0.85 with a micro average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In a document, the existence of a time expression is usually followed by important facts or information in the vicinity [10]. Expressions of time have several types, there are range, sequence, duration, function, other types, and omitted phenomena [11]. A range is a period between two times or dates. The sequence is a sequence of several time ranges. Duration is a period. Functions include implied semantic entities. Another type is complementary in representing time expressions such as numbers which indicate numbers without any inherent temporal meaning. Omitted phenomena focus on events or states relative to expressions of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this research, a NER will be developed to identify and recognized time expression entities for Balinese text documents using a rule-based approach. The rules are made based on direct observation of documents that have a certain pattern by observing the morphological and contextual structures. Evaluation is done by calculating the average of the precision, recall, and f-measure values of the resulting NER.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">The process stages of developing a rule-based NER for Balinese text include data preprocessing, identifying the time expression entity with the NER, then generate output as time expression entity according to the established rules. The preprocessing stage includes case folding, data cleaning, and tokenization. The results from the preprocessing stage will be used as input for the identification process of the time expression entity with a rule-based NER for the Balinese text document. The following is a flow chart of the NER development process which can be seen in figure 1.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>2.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Preprocessing</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Data preprocessing is a stage for preparing text into data that is ready to be processed for the next stage. In this study, there are four preprocessing stages, namely data cleansing, case folding, punctuation removal, and tokenization. Data cleansing is the stage of detecting, eliminating errors, and inconsistencies in data to improve data quality, such as changing the character é to e. Case folding is the stage of changing all letters in the text document to lowercase. Punctuation removal is the stage of removing punctuation marks for the example ',! \ &quot;# $% &amp;&nbsp;() * +.:; &lt;=&gt;? @ [\] ^ _` {|} ~ \ that is contained in the text. Tokenization is the breakdown step string into the smallest unit called a token. In this research, what is meant by the token is the word.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2.3.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule-based</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">The results obtained from preprocessing data, then used for the next stage, namely NER by using a rule-based approach. At this stage, rule-based checks the suitability of each token toward each rule that has been made. If any of the rules matches, the token is identified as a named entity i.e. a time expression. However, if no rules match, it will proceed to the next token.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rules for NER are made based on direct observation of documents that have a certain pattern. Besides, rules are made with due regard to the morphological and contextual structures. The morphological structure is based on the structure of the word, as in table 1. The contextual structure observing to the word to be used as initially annotated text, as in table 2. For example,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">when you find the word &quot;pinanggal&quot; it is usually followed by a time expression such as 17/8 so that the next word is a time expression.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">In this research, to determine the performance produced by NER in identifying and recognized time expression entities, an evaluation measurement technique be required. Evaluation is carried out to obtain the average precision, recall, and f-measure values. Precision is a comparison of the amount of relevant information obtained by the system with the total amount of information retrieved by the system, whether relevant or not. Recall is a comparison of the amount of relevant information obtained by the system with the amount of all relevant information contained in the collection of information either that has been or has not been retrieved by the system. F-measure is the relationship between precision and recall that provides system accuracy. The following is an equation for calculating precision (1), recall (2), and f-measure (3).</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font0">Based on the tests, we get the average value of precision is 0.85, recall is 0.87, and f-measure is 0.85. In the table, it is shown that several documents have less than optimal values of precision, recall, and f-measure. This is affected by several factors, such as errors in writing time expressions such as days, the existence of an entity that has not been recognized by NER as a time expression entity because the rules have not been defined and some words or phrases which are not classified as time expression entities but are recognized by the system.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Number of occurrences of the time expression type</span></h2><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/64413-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:316pt;height:150pt;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Figure 2. </span><span class="font0">Number of Occurrences of Time Expression Type</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides that, we can see the number of occurrences of the most recognizable time expression type in Figure 2. A sequence is a type of time expression that is most easily recognized and retrieved by the system. This is because most of the testing data are news articles, which contain time expressions such as sequences to explain the sequence of events. In this system, the types of time expressions that can decrease accuracy are duration and function. This is because there are various styles of writing, such as 20-30 January 2020, on the other hand, there are those who write 20 January-30 January 2020 or 20 January nyantos 30 January 2020.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">We have built Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a rule-based approach. NER recognizes time expression entities in Balinese text documents. Rules are built based on direct observation of documents and use the morphological and contextual structures. Based on the research conducted, it is concluded that the rule-based approach can be used in NER on Balinese text documents and able to provide results based on the compatibility with the rules. The results showed that the average precision, recall, and f-measure values are 0.85, 0.87, and 0.85. A sequence is the most recognizable time expression type because most of the testing data are news articles, which contain time expressions to explain the sequence of events. Hopefully in the future, the development of NER to identify time expression entities in Balinese documents will continue to be carried out with other approaches so that it is expected to be able to recognize all types of time expressions.</span></p>
