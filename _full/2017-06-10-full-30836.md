Recently instead of selecting a kernel has been proposed which uses SVR where the weight of each kernel is optimized during training Along this line of research many pioneering kernel learning algorithms have been proposed The use of kernels provides a powerful and principled approach to modeling nonlinear patterns through linear patterns in a feature space Another benet is that the design of kernels and linear methods can be decoupled which greatly facilit
