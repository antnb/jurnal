Abstrak  Cancer is a dangerous disease which is one of the main causes of death in the world which is 88 million deaths in 2015 A new method has been developed for the treatment of cancer with small side effects Boron Neutron Capture Therapy BNCT BNCT is based on the ability of nonradioactive isotopes Boron10 to capture thermal neutrons Boron is the main key of the BNCT process wherein radiation of cancer cells can be carried out selectively if the canc
