<p><span class="font2">The development of natura ltourism in Peliatan Village would certainly be able to run well if there is support from all sectors, companies related to tourism services, suppliers, marketing intermediaries, consumers, competitors, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">society. All of these components are very supportive of a destination to attract tourists. Some of the things that need to be analyzed in the marketing environment are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Company</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">There are several industrial companies in the Peliatan Village. Most of them are: the commodity-making industry of religious ceremonies, food stalls, workshops and shops. While the industry engaged in tourism consists of Art Studio both dance art, art tabuh, and painting, Homestay, Hotel, guest house, Restaurant, coffe bar, and cafe. There are at least 100 hotels, homestays, guest houses and inns with an average price of Rp. 180,000 per night for non AC, and Rp.250,000 per night for AC facilities. There are 50 restaurants, food stalls and cafes. Besides, the tourist attractions to visit in Peliatan Village are a legong and kecak dances, customs, and religious ceremonies. Today, however, tourists are not so much interested in watching the dance due to the unfair price and PATREM (permit) prevailing from Distibia Regency.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplier</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Most of the suppliers to hotels, villas, homestays, restaurants, cafes come from outside Peliatan Village area. Only few of local people Peliatan Village became suppliers to hotels, villas, homestays, restaurants, and cafes located in Peliatan Village area. However, most of local people tend to be supplier to handicrafts sold in artshop.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing intermediator: the marketing of tourism industry in Peliatan Village, can be conducted directly (personally) between industry owner and consumer under coordination of village officials / village administrators. It can be done by distributing brochures to travel agents, as well as through websites on the internet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumer</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The visitors of Peliatan Village come from foreign tourists such as China, America, Australia, Japan, Korea and others. The dominant tourists come from China. They are interested in seeing typical Balinese dances such as kecak and legong dances. Besides, there are also domestic tourists, who come from the island of Java, Kalimantan.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitor:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">There are a lot of competitiors coming from Ubud village, which is very closed to Peliatan Village, Petulu village, Mas village, Tegalalang village, and Pejeng village. Ubud village has Ubud market serving and offering various kinds of art goods and a number of supporting tourism infrastructures, such as hotels, restaurants, homestays, cafes and others, Besides, Ubud has frequently performed kecak dance and legong dance, making it the most serious threat to Peliatan Village, although it sometimes does not match with PATREM issued by DISTIBIA regency. Meanwhile, Petulu Village is famous for its eco-like birdwatching and kokokan. Mas Village is famous for its unique sculptures. Tegallalang Village has beautiful natural scenery and as a handicraft supplier as well. Many villas are built in Pejeng village and it has the potential of natural tourism very much. Many</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">tourists often do cycling while enjoying the beauty of rice fields.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Until now Peliatan villagers are still lacking in getting empowerment and coaching guidance from the village government, district and provincial governments, so it is expected the people can have a coaching, especially in handling the problems of tourism, so it can support the tourism life in Peliatan Village area . Peliatan Village people are always involved in decision making concerning tourism, in order to avoid misunderstanding and unconformity between the village government and the community. Each will have a development or any plan related to the village, village officials always communicate to the community through village meetings. In the house regulation of the village it is stipulated that there are some rules about the development of tourism in Peliatan Village, where the development of tourism in Peliatan Village should be in line with Tri Hita Karana, and not threaten the harmony of nature and society, and the prohibition to the community to traded customary land (PKD ) as well as village wasteland (AYDS).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All of the above components can support the activities of natural tourism that will be developed in Peliatan Village. Local people not only as the owner of homestay, the owner of arshop, but also can develop natural tourism products as an attraction to come to visit Peliatan Village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The contribution of natural tourism to the economy of local communities is as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural tourism activities must be directly supported by supporting facilities such as accommodation facilities, transportation, restaurants or food stalls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of natural tourism opens new jobs for the community, such as tour guide, ticket guard, parking attendant, selling typical Balinese food and drinks and so forth. So that the income earned by the local community can be useful for daily life as part of the community that is in the tourism destinations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of natural tourism can give the opportunity to open a food stall/ restaurant, to give the opportunity to open a businesses of lodging / accommodation, &nbsp;souvenirs making, Balinese foods,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">camping, other outbound, selling natural tour packages.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of natural tourism in Peliatan Village drives the wheels of the people's economy. It can attract investors to build hotels and inns.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of natural tourism can increase people's ability to save money. This shows that it can drive the local people's economy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of natural tourism can meet the daily needs and can send their children to the higher level of education.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of natural tourism can make people to have no problem in earning and living</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natural tourism can increase family income, meet the daily needs, result in getting a permanent job, send their family members to a higher education.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Indirectly:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a. The tourism activities can increase the local income of the village. It can improve the development and open new job vacancies. People are commiited to obey &quot;Tri Hita Karana&quot; conceptions: maintaining good relationship with God, environment and between humans. If three are no harmony, there is no balance then. Besides, people believe that even though tourism has been growing fast, they would not forget the tradition and customs that have been inherited by our ancestors. This is unvaluable heritage.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The development of natural tourism can attract investors to build hotels and inns. They think that investors can accelerate the development of tourism in Peliatan Village, but they are also restless if investors keep buying and making use of the land in Peliatan Village indiscriminately that can disrupt the social life of society and environment in Peliatan Village. Meanwhile, there are people being disagreed with the intervention of investors in the development of natural tourism in Peliatan Village.</span></p>
