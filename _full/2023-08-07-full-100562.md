  - "estrogen"
  - "prolactin"
  - "oxytocin"
  - "and testosterone. The cortisol"
  - "estrogen"
  - "and testosterone increase genital sexual arousal by direct effect. Genital sexual arousal occurs due to the increased thickness of the vaginal epithelium"
  - "increase vaginal lubrication"
  - "and increase genital sensations. Prolactin and oxytocin influence genital sexual arousal by indirect effect. Acute exercise also increases the activation of the sympathetic nervous system which leads to increased genital sexual arousal in females. The increased sympathetic tone leads to increase cardiac output and vasodilatation. Vasodilatation causes an increase in blood flow to the genital organ. Conclusion: Acute exercise increases genital sexual arousal in females via hormonal and sympathetic nervous system pathways. Keywords: acute exercise; genital; hormonal; sexual arousal"
