<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Austroeupatorium inulifolium.</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ageratiua. riparia</span><span class="font3"> are listed as aggressive invaders in Global Compendium of Weeds. Both invaders have the ability to regenerate and rapidly invade natural and agricultural ecosystems and have been identified as having strongly negative environmental impacts. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ageratina riparia</span><span class="font3"> is native to Central America and has emerged a serious invasive weed in many tropical and warm t emperate regions of the world. Originat ed from Central America, nowadays </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Austroeupatorium. inulifolium</span><span class="font3"> pose as a severe weed in areas of agricultural ecosystems and nature reserve (Haluwana and Madawala 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Batukahu Nature Reserve plays a critical role in supporting biodiversity and forest conservation of mountain ecosystems in Bali; consisting forest habitats and large lakes system in the surrounding area. However, this reserve has been greatly modified by a long history of human disturbance, such as logging, conversion of forest into settlements, plantation and agriculture, and geothermal mining; all factors promote the spread and establishment of invasive plants. The present study addresses the patterns of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Austroeupatorium. inulifolium</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ageratiiia riparia.</span><span class="font3"> and the extent of their distributional range along altitudinal gradients in Mt Pohen, Batukahu Nature Reserve, Bedugul, Bali.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;METHODS</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The study was conducted in Mt Pohen, Batukahu Nature Reserve, Bedugul, Bali (Figure 1); it is about 60 km North of Denpasar City. The Batukahu Nature Reserve occupied an area of 1.762,80 ha and has been protected since 1974. It consists of Batukahu I (Tapak), Batukahu II (Pohen) and Batukahu HI (Lesong). Most area on these mountain regions is higher than IOOO m in altitude and the highest peak is 2089 meter above sea level, with annual precipitation is 2000 mm per year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The invasive Asteraceae were sampled in October 2013. The cover abundance of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Austroeupatorium inulifolium and Ageratina riparia</span><span class="font3"> were measured by establishing 92 plot samples along four different forest tracks encompassed elevational ranges from the lowest (forest borders) to the highest elevation of Mt Pohen. The transects were stratified by four different forest conditions;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less disturbed sites (forest sites affected by low intensity fire),</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undisturbed sites,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;highly disturbed sites (forest sites affected by high intensity wildfires located at the lower elevation), 4) moderately disturbed sites (forest sites affected by high intensity wildfires)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Along the walking trails, the occurrence of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Austroeupatorium iuulifolium and Ageratiua. riparia. </span><span class="font3">outside the quadrat were also recorded.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invasive species abundance related to site characteristics</span></h3></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The results showed that coverage of both invasions were highly variable on these forest sites (Figure 2). The abundance of A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">iuulifolium</span><span class="font3"> and A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">riparia.</span><span class="font3"> were mostly associated with disturbed habitats. A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">iuulifolium</span><span class="font3"> occurred most abundantly in site 4 and site 3; while A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">riparia.</span><span class="font3"> also showed its abundance related to site 3, followed by site 4 (Figure 2). A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">riparia.</span><span class="font3"> also occurred quite abundant in site 1 (less disturbed sites) and site 2 (undisturbed sites); particularly found smothering the understory vegetation along the forest tracks in the undisturbed forest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Studies have shown that disturbed forest sites are more vulnerable to species invasion than the undisturbed sites (Dawson et al. 2011; Hobbs and Huenneke 1992; Richardson and Pysek 2006). In this study, the highly disturbed sites (site 3) were highly invaded in comparison to other sites, as they correspond to forest borders having higher constancy and occupancy of introduced species than those of the intact forest plots. This site 3 was the forests sites affected by wildfires; characterized by open canopy and located at the lower elevation correspond to forest borders. Field observations showed that these forest borders are noticeably invaded by both invaders. The suitability of these “disturbed” habitats combined with high propagule pressure might lead to rapid colonization by these alien plant species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Disturbance often results forest openness which provides more resources (light, space, and resource) for invasive plants to rapidly establish and populate. In the disturbed sites which likely had the impact of high severity of the fire, forest vegetation has been altered significantly, and a striking feature was also reflected by dense impenetrable thicket of A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">iuulifolium.</span><span class="font3"> particularly found in lower altitude sites (Figure 3). A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Inulifolium.</span><span class="font3"> is a perennial shrub forming dense scrambled bushes 1 - 5 m in height. It</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribution OfInvasiveAsteraceae along altitudinal gradients</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A. inulifolium</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A. riparia.</span><span class="font3"> covers large area from lowest elevation sites (forest borders) up to the highest peak of the Mt Pohen. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A. inulifolium</span><span class="font3"> was observed in wide distribution reaching the highest peak of the Mt Pohen (2035 m dpi), while </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A. riparia. </span><span class="font3">also reached the elevation up to around 1950 m dpi (Figure 4).) Both invaders particularly invaded the most disturbed sites correlate with the forest edge, as showed by their high frequency and abundance at the lower altitude. While site 3 in this forest habitat was highly invaded by A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">inulifolium</span><span class="font3"> and A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">riparia, </span><span class="font3">others were sparsely invaded. However, high abundance of A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">inulifolium.</span><span class="font3"> at the higher elevation was also clearly noticed. These results indicate that both invasive plants are able to percolate deep into the forest interior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Invasive plants typically need high light and nutrients that are best provided along the edge environments (Watkins et al., 2003 and Pauchard and Alaback 2006). The spreading non-forest species into forest interior highly depend on the site characteristics, and disturbed forest habitats affected by fire likely facilitate the establishment of invaders. The species traits (high propagule) and the on-going</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">human disturbance along the forest tracks also likely explain current distribution and the possibility of expanding its range into the forest interior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Invasion is identified as a serious threat to tropical mountains and its impacts are especially damaging in native forests that have undergone disturbance, while the upper-mountain regions are even more critically vulnerable (Burke 2003). In forest habitats that have undergone disturbance, such as human-induced and fire affected areas, the Asteraceae invaders occurred in a high abundance. Dense stands of A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">inulifolium</span><span class="font3"> which form impenetrable thickets clearly indicate the successful replacement of native plants by this forest invader, and this can lead to further influences ecosystem structure and species composition. Alien invasions often change the physical and biotic environment to alter the dominance or eliminate native species from an ecosystem, particularly through processes of competition and replacement. Following fire disturbance, these invasive plants have likely disrupted the forest succession by restricting native plant growth and recruitment, and this can also lead to reduced species richness of native plants, and further resulted devastating effects on the survival of specialist with limited ranges and small population sizes (Chandrasekaram and Swamy 2002; Riddock et al. 1991). Furthermore, the Asteraceae invaders identified as likely increasing along the altitudinal gradients. This underlines that the greatest environmental impacts are obviously damaging the native forests and these invaders should be given the greatest attention and the highest priority for eradication.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSIONS</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The general patterns provided an insight of Asteraceae mountain invaders, the A </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Itiulifolium</span><span class="font3"> and A </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ri.pαriα,</span><span class="font3"> and forest disturbance (fire and human disturbance) as reliable explanation underlying their spread into higher elevation. Due to its facility to regenerate and its fast invasion, both Asteraceae invaders have the potential as greatest weed threat to Bedugul Reserve. This study provides a baseline data for conservation managers to detect, control and monitor the invasive plants within the nature reserve. Further research need to be done to determine the environmental and biotic factors that influence their presence and abundance.</span></p>
