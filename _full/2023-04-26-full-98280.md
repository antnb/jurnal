<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">In red onion farming there have a problem of price fluctuations which result in an uneven and less transparent distribution of red onions yields. Thus, affecting both consumers and producers. To answer these problems, we designed a system to maintain and store red onion harvest data for farmers, collectors, distributors, and retailers in the form of a blockchainbased supply chain system. Supply chain management in red onion farming is beneficial for cost control, increased efficiency, product availability, product tracking, and increased profits. This system can maintain the validity of transactions in the supply chain of red onion farming with a private blockchain with Hyperledger Fabric. Then the data on the blockchain system will be displayed through the Hyperledger Explorer website. From the research and testing of the system, this system can help the red onion farming to maintain the validity of transactions in the supply chain management.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">One of the superior agricultural commodities in Indonesia, namely red onion. Red onion is a spice vegetable that is consumed by everyone in the world [1]. Red onion has been cultivated intensively by farmers. Indonesian farmers have long been trying to make red onion farming a part of one of the leading commodities in the intensively managed vegetable sector. The existence of the red onion commodity has made a major contribution to improving the economy of farming communities so that this commodity is widely used as a source of income for red onion cultivation entrepreneurs, which are almost entirely spread across all provinces in Indonesia [2]. Even though there are quite a large number of enthusiasts to become red onion farmers, various technical and economic constraints in its utilization still exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of the studies by V. Sudha, R. Kalaiselvi, and P. Shanmugasundaram, discussed the problems of farmers in India caused by very poor Supply Chain Management because there</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">was no system that could track the status of goods at various stages of transportation. This research provides a system solution with blockchain-based technology to achieve transparency about the status of goods. By storing the details on the blockchain, the entire process is visible to both farmers and those involved in transportation. And the immutable annals of history will remain forever [3].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the era of the industrial revolution 4.0 which was marked by an intelligent system. Industry 4.0 has become a buzzword that describes the trend towards digitalization and automation of manufacturing. It allows products, machines, components, individuals, and systems to create a smart network so that it can integrate cyber-physical systems to act quickly by linking information and physical memory to the smart network for faster and more effective service environments [4]. Supply chain era 4.0 aims to make people closer to farmers or in terms of agribusiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Blockchain is one of the results of technology 4.0, the blockchain system can be interpreted as a distributed ledger or ledger that can track all activities on the blockchain system, every record of this activity is an activity that has been approved. Through the application of blockchain to the supply chain, it can simplify the supply chain network, build trust between stakeholders and the supply chain. With this, the authors built a supply chain system to manage harvest data on red onion farming in 7 districts in Central Java Province (Brebes, Tegal, Demak, Pati, Boyolali, Temanggung, and Kendal). Supply Chain Management is divided into several nodes, namely producers, distributors, stores and final customers. This supply chain system consists of farmers, collectors, distributors, and retailers/retailers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The purpose of this study is to design a supply chain and maintain security on red onion agricultural harvest data in 7 districts and document transactions that occur in the supply chain. Supply chain management in red onion farming is beneficial for cost control, increased efficiency, product availability, product tracking, and increased profits. In this research, the blockchain system is private. Then to implement the blockchain system using the Hyperledger Fabric framework to build a private blockchain system. And as a dashboard display for the blockchain system it uses the open source Hyperledger Explorer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">From the journals and research that we already studied; we can summarize several findings as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>3.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blockchain</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Blockchain is a technology that can be used in data processing, blockchain technology has a decentralized concept with characteristics of being transparent and secure [10]. Blockchain is a collection of blocks that contain transaction data that are interrelated (chain) and sequential with each other. It is a form of distributed database which contains transactions stored in a block of data. Each block has a unique hash that is generated from the contents of the block itself. Each block stores the hash of the previous block thus forming a chain that is stored at each node in the Peer-to-peer network [11]. The Blockchain database works on a global network of many nodes (volunteer nodes), so no one controls the data and the network. All transactions are recorded, can be easily accessed and transparent. The principle of blockchain technology is analogous to a ledger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The blockchain is analogous to a distributed ledger having all this information (amount, party, transaction time and other relevant information), and then doing it online, then distributed copying this information only to all the computers in the system. Therefore, unique copies of this</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">information exist in multiple locations. This is done so that the information can then be received by each party that is part of this system. The goal is to ensure the security and authenticity of this information, this is the advantage of the blockchain system technology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Blockchain consists of three main components, namely blocks, chains, and networks (network): Block: a list of recorded transactions in the general ledger during certain time. The size, period, and triggers for each block differ from network to other network blockchains. Not all blockchains record and secure all transactions as such main goal. However, every blockchain records the movement of transactions or tokens. The transaction process here is the process of recording data. Specifies the value to that block which is later it will be used as a reference for interpreting the data recorded in the block [12].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the blockchain system, a block consists of three elements, namely data, the hash of the block, and the hash of the previous block. To be connected to the chain, each block has its own cryptographic hash as well as the hash of the previous block. The hash contains an identical alphanumeric number which is calculated based on the block's data, the timestamp, as well as the hash of the previous block. Blockchain database stores data in a grouped structure. Each data group stores some specific information. Once entered, each block will be linked to the previous block and the blocks that follow it, thus forming a series of blockchain systems. A block that has been entered into a series that functions as a permanent data record, the data in that block cannot be changed or deleted.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/98280-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:330pt;height:254pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1 </span><span class="font3">Blockchain System Works Flow</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The application of security (sharing security) in maintaining data security makes blockchain one of the technologies with a fairly good level of security. With this system the possibility of data to be hacked is reduced [13]. Blockchain is grouped into two types, there are Public Blockchain and Private Blockchain. Public Blockchain is a ledger or distributed ledger of all transactions, so that data on the blockchain cannot be tampered with by users. When transactions occur on the blockchain network, blocks are formed. The blocks cannot be added to the blockchain until participating organizations have validated the block. The length of this verification process also varies, it can be real time or it can take longer based on the number of members of the organization and several other factors. The approvals required to validate the blockchain system are implemented to ensure that the security, privacy, and integrity of the blockchain system are maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Private Blockchain, the owner of the blockchain system has significant influence over its design and subsequent operation. In this case, if you want to become a node, you must get permission from the Blockchain regulator (owner). Only genuine members are allowed to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">access and store data on the Blockchain. Therefore, this Private Blockchain is a type of blockchain that is private and less secure. Here Blockchain network participants can be identified and blocks can be changed according to the policies of the Private Blockchain owner can be used as long as the authority (Private Blockchain owner) guarantees its security. There are six features that are the advantages of Private Blockchain technology, there are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Validation/Consensus: Consensus algorithms are usually used to validate blocks before they are included in the chain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immutable: Once a block is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed or deleted. This is because the block is connected to the block before and after it. Small changes to a block will cause changes to all blocks in the series.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replicate/Peer to Peer Network: Blockchain uses a decentralized network which is often called a public ledger. In this system, each node/participant has a unique copy of every transaction that takes place on the blockchain network.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transparency: All system users can see every transaction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secure: Blockchain systems have no central authority, which means that data is stored identically across multiple computers. In order to hack, a hacker has to hack every node in every network simultaneously.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart Contracts: This smart contract is a code of agreement between two people in the Blockchain network that contains specific terms. Transactions will only occur if these special conditions are met between two nodes without involving third party intervention. This is possible because the entire smart contract process is carried out automatically in the blockchain system.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperledger Fabric</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Hyperledger Fabric is an enterprise-grade open sources platform that is maintained by IBM and Linux Foundation. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric does not have any cryptocurrency, where the access to the network is restricted to the network members only, and not anyone can join the network [14]. Hyperledger Fabric is used to build blockchain systems that are permissioned (private). The use of Hyperledger Fabric has advantages in writing smart contracts to the process of installing these smart contracts into the blockchain network that is being built. Implement the execute-order-validate architecture in Hyperledger Fabric transaction flows.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/98280-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:318pt;height:210pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Figure 2 Hyperledger Fabric Transaction Flow</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From figure 2, we can see that Hyperledger Fabric Transaction Flow have several steps as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">a. &nbsp;Execution phase</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">In the execution phase, the client sends a transaction proposal that has been signed by the system, to be executed by peer endorsers. The transaction proposal has a group of input</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">parameters that will be used by the smart contact. The simulation process of executing transaction proposals for each endorser with a world state, without changing the stored value. Each peer endorser can generate a transaction response that contains a key-value that can be changed (writeset) and a key-value that can be read (readset). The transaction response (response transaction) is given a signature (endorsement) and then returned to the client. The client collects endorsements until they comply with the endorsement policy. All endorsements have the same writeset and readset. After the endorsement policy has been fulfilled, the client can make transactions and collect them from orderers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordering Phase</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">In the ordering stage, namely, orderers use the order of all transactions that have been collected by the client and stored in the block. In a block, the number and size of transactions (BatchSize) are configured in parameters, and the block waiting time (BatchTimeout). Due to the large number of transactions collected by the client at different times or simultaneously, the transactions cannot be sorted by the time they arrive at the orderers. Transactions collected at the same time will be two different blocks.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Validation Phase</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">In the validation phase, orderers carry out the process of broadcasting blocks to peers who are already connected. Then the peer gossip protocol to other peers to send blocks. There are three stages for the peer to validate all transactions in the received block, there are: 1) Checking the endorsement policy in a parallel manner. If the endorsement cannot match, then the transaction will be invalid, 2) Checking conflicts on read-write sequentially. If the readset version and the key version are not the same as the world state, then the transaction is invalid, 3) Updating the distributed ledger on approved transactions will update the world state, and other valid and invalid transactions will be stored on the blockchain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">As shown in the figure 6, the system has features including Register User, Create Asset, Read Asset, Transfer Asset, Update Asset, Delete Asset, and Get All Assets. From the above use case diagram, the implementation is carried out to realize the design using the following software Windows 10 Operating System, Visual Studio Code, Filezilla, Docker Swarm, Postman, Command Prompt, and EC2 Amazon Web Services, Google Chrome. To create the blockchain network, programming languages were used which consist of 81% shell script, 10.1% Golang, and 8.9% Javascript. In the blockchain network, the ledger or the distributed ledger technology uses the CouchDB database.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The development stage of the Blockchain system using the private Hyperledger Fabric. The first step that can be taken is to install Prerequesites on each virtual machine. This is done to ensure that the machine (virtual machine) used already has the prerequisites installed on the system. The systems installed on the virtual machine include: 1) Docker Engine dan Docker Compose, 2) Docker Swarm, 3) NodeJS and NPM, 4) Go version gol.18.7, 5) Git.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Each transaction is defined in a program that can be executed by each peer called a smart contract [15]. Smart contracts on Hyperledger Fabric are defined in the chaincode, the chaincode will be called by every application that will interact with the ledger. Chaincode is most often called when the application interacts with the database ledger and also the world state. Chaincode can be written using the Java, Go, and NodeJS programming languages. At this stage, the author uses the Go programming language to build smart contracts on chaincode. And using Docker Swarm, Docker Swarm is designed using two virtual machines. Each as Swarm Manager and Swarm Worker [16].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Hyperledger Fabric there are smart contracts defined in chaincode. Chaincode can be written using the Java, Go, and NodeJS programming languages. At this stage, the author uses the Go programming language to build smart contracts on chaincode. The smart contract in this study contains transactions feature, including:</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">One of the studies from Dian Ardifah Iswari, Yandra Arkeman, and Muslich entitled Analysis and Design of Blockchain-Based Cocoa Supply Chains. This research discusses the development of a blockchain-based supply chain system. This blockchain system is used by every member of the supply chain (farmers, farmer leaders, factory processors, retailers, and consumers). The system in this research is used to facilitate the flow of information in the cocoa supply chain, to facilitate the documentation of all activities, to facilitate the calculation of the total price of cocoa, and to facilitate the payment process. However, this study has several weaknesses, namely the low ability of stakeholders to use the new system, stakeholders do not have email or cellphones, and uneven internet access. While the advantages and disadvantages of the research &quot;Implementation of a Supply Chain Management System Blockchain-Based in Red Onion Farming&quot;, that is:</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font0">Based on table 4, this system requires further investigation on security at the web server level, due to the limited resources of the researchers. Thus, in the next research, security level will be explored thoroughly. From the hyperledger explorer, we can summarize that our Supply chain management in red onion farming is beneficial for cost control, increased defficiency, product availability, product tracking, and increased profits.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Based on the results of the research that has been done, it has been concluded that the application of the Blockchain system using the Hyperledger Fabric framework has been successfully implemented with the development method. With this research, it is hoped that farmers, collectors, distributors, and retailers will carry out red onion distribution activities in 7 districts (Demak, Boyolali, Temanggung, Pati, Kendal, Brebes, and Tegal). And it can also make it easier for admins to manage users and resources used. This research was tested using the Black Box Testing method. From the results of this research, further development will be carried out related to blockchain-based supply chains by adding a transaction function (smart contract) using the wallet feature on the blockchain system. The development of this system will be reviewed further in further research.</span></p>
