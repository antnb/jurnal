<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background</span></h1></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Tabanan regency is one of regencies in Bali which for the needs of water supply for the community is very dependent on PDAM of Tabanan regency. Based on Tabanan Regency Regulation No. 14 Year 2006 on PDAM of Tabanan, the purpose of PDAM is generally: (1) to participate in implementing regional development, (2) in an effort to increase revenue, (3) to provide public services to meet the needs of clean water, sanitation and the applicable requirements, (4) to regulate the use of water evenly and efficiently and prevent illegal extraction of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the data obtained from PDAM of Tabanan during the period of 3 years (Year 2013 to the Year 2015) customer complaints are said to be quite high (still above 5%). In the Year 2013 customer complaints as much as 6.32%, in 2014 rose to 7.16%, and in the year 2015 to 5.02%. In addition to customer complaints, the leakage rate for the last three years (Year 2013 to 2015) is said to be high. In 2013 a leak rate reached 26.51%, Year 2014 became 25.11% and 2015 amounted to 22.39%. Based on the Decree of Ministry of Home Affair No. 47 of 1999 on Guidelines for Drinking Water Company Performance Assessment, the maximum limit leakage that can be tolerated by 20%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The data presented regarding customer complaints and a high leakage rate indicate that the performance</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of Tabanan regency PDAM is not in line with the expectation. In order to increase organizational performance and to achieve the organizational goals then a strong organizational culture is needed, culture in this regard includes values, norms and attitudes (Riva, et al., 2011). Davidson et al. (2007) states that the organizational culture affects the performance of the company, as well as Kotter and Heskett (1997) suggests organizational culture has significant influence on a long-term economic performance, as well as able to determine the success and failure of the company in the future. Denison (1991) develops the linkages between the organizational culture and management activities business performance, by developing four key nature of culture of the organization including: involment, consistency, adaptability and mission. The influence of organizational culture with local wisdom (the culture of Tri Hita Karana) conducted by Riana (2010); Astawa et al. (2012); and Surya et al. (2014) found that the results of Tri Hita Karana culture was positive and significant effect on the performance of the organization or company. Different conditions were found by Denison et al. (2004); Raka Suardana (2003); Lim (1995); Subroto (2009); Yuan and Lee (2011); Ferbruanto (2011); and Dharmanegara et al (2013). And said that organizational culture does not affect the company's performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other factors that affect the company's performance is the organizational commitment, because of the commitment showed confidence and strong support on the values and goals to be achieved by the organization (Mowday et al. 1982). Organizational commitment can be generated by individuals who have an emotional attachment to the organization that includes moral support and accept the existing value as well as self determination to serve the organization (Porter et al. 1974), while according to Wiener (1982) organizational commitment is an encouragement of the individual to do something in order to support the success of organization in accordance with the objectives that prioritize the interests than the interests of the organization itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Various previous studies that look at the relationship between organizational commitment to performance such as research by Rashid et al. (2006) that there is a positive influence of organizational commitment on organizational performance. So is the case with the research conducted by Somers, (1998); Kamaliah, (2012); Koesmono (2011); Syauta (2012) indicating that the organizational commitment affects organizational performance. While Randall et al.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1990) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;states that organizational commitment does not affect the organization's performance. In contrast to the results of research by Shaw et al. (2003) on the influence of organizational commitment to organizational performance between immigrant workers with native workers indicating that migrant workers organizational commitment does not affect the organization's performance, while the native workers organizational commitment had significant positive effect on organizational performance.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Based on studies that have been conducted this study was motivated by:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To test the results of some previous studies as presented previously that there are contradictory about the relationship between variables, in addition to the results of previous research still leave a phenomenon that local content in respect of the local organization's culture will greatly affect the relationship between variables that have been built have not been widely studied.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling the research gap using harmonic values contained in the local culture of Tri Hita Karana in organizational practices, especially public service organizations</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">Robbins (2009) said that the organizational culture as a common perception is held by members of the organization and becomes a system of shared meaning. Schein (2004) choses a definition that can explain how culture develops, how the culture became what it is today, or how culture can be changed if the organization's survival is at stake. Furthermore, Hofstede (2001) identified four basic problem areas that can be considered as the cultural dimensions, namely (1) social inequality, including relations with the authorities; (2) the relationship between individuals and groups; (3) the concept of masculinity and femininity, is a social implications as gender distinctions; and (4) attitudes toward uncertainty,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Hita Karana (THK)</span><span class="font4">is a product of human behavior that are more subjective and interpretative. Therefore, the symbols will be established by a subjective understanding associated with phenomena that have objective consequences. In connection with THK, parahyangan is analogousto the subsystem of value, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">pawongan</span><span class="font4">is analogous to the social subsystem and palemahan is analogous to subsystem of artifacts (Windia 2011). </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">pawongan,</span><span class="font4"> dan </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">palemahan</span><span class="font4">. Dengan demikian, nilai-nilai yang terkandung di dalam budaya </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">THK</span><span class="font4"> telah digunakan sebagai suatu tata nilai yang digunakan sebagai pegangan anggota organisasi dalam melaksanakan kewajiban dan berperilaku. Apabila dibuatkan dalam bentuk matriks perbandingan antara teori budaya Hofstede, Schein, Koentjaraninggrat, dan budaya </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Hita Karana</span><span class="font4"> (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">THK</span><span class="font4">) dapat dilihat pada Tabel1 berikut. Cultural elements; artifacts, espouse values, and basic assumptions (Schein, 2004) and subsystems of mindset, social subsystems, artifacts (Koentjaraninggrat, 2005) are reflected in the cultural elements of THK, namely </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">parahyangan, pawongan, </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">palemahan</span><span class="font4">. Thus, the value contained in THK culture has been used as a value system that is used as a handle for the member of organization in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">implementing the obligations and behave. If it is converted into the form of a comparison matrix between culture theory of Hofstede, Schein, Koentjaraninggrat, and culture of Tri Hita Karana (THK) can be seen in Table 1 below.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Table 1 shows that the characteristics and cultural dimensions of THK has been reflected in the dimensions of some concepts of culture (Koentjaraninggrat, Schein and Hofstede). Thus, the concept of THK is a cultural concept in which the values contained in it have colored a variety of community life, especially in Bali, including in conducting business activities that can be categorized as a cultural organization.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizational Commitment</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Mowday et al. (1982) suggested that organizational commitment consists of three components, namely acceptance and strong beliefs to the values and goals of the organization, the individual's willingness to strive earnestly for the sake of the organization as well as a strong desire to maintain membership in the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Meyer and Allen (1991) there are three components of organizational commitment are: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1) “Affective commitment refers to the employee's emotional attachment to, identification with, and involvement in the organization. Employees with a strong affective commitment continue employment with the organization because they want to do so”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">2)</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Continuance &nbsp;&nbsp;commitment refers to an</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">awareness of the costs associated with leaving the organization. Employees whose primary</span><span class="font4"> link </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to the organization</span><span class="font4"> is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">based on continuance </span><span class="font4">commitment </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">remain because they need to do</span><span class="font4"> so”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Normative commitment reflects a feeling of obligation to continue employmen</span><span class="font4">t </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Employees with a high level of normative commitment feel that they ought to</span><span class="font4"> remain </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">with the organization”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The common thing of these three approaches is the idea that organizational commitment is a psychological condition that characterizes the relationship between employees and the organization and has implications for an individual's decision to remain or leave the organization, however, the nature and psychological conditions for forms of commitment are very different.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Hasibuan (2013) defines performance as a record of gains resulting from a particular job functions and activities during a specific time period. If the job performance or productivity of employees after following the development of both quality and quantity of work increases, it means the development method set is pretty good. While Bernadin (2003) defines performance as” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The record of outcomes produced on a specified job function, activity, or behavior during a specified time period.</span><span class="font4">” It can be concluded that the performance of the organization is the final achievement of an organization and contains a few things, such as their specific targets to be achieved, has a period in the attainment and achievement of efficiency and effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Mardiasmo (2002), suggests the performance benchmarks of public organizations are related to the size of the success that can be achieved by the organization, the relevant unit of measure used is the efficiency of fund management and the quality level of service that can be provided to the public. Thus, it can be stated that the performance of public organizations is the work to ensure the achievement of organizational goals in accordance with the vision, mission and goals of the organization. So to assess the performance of public organizations, several indicators are needed namely; effectiveness, efficiency, economy and equity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to improve water service to the community in terms of quantity, quality, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">continuity, the Ministry of Home Affair has issued Regulation No. 47 Year 1999 on Guidelines for Assessment of Regional Water Company Performance. These guidelines should be used to determine the success of directors in managing the PDAM as well as a basis in determining the classification level of PDAM success. Chapter II, Article 2 and Article 3, mention the Supervisory Board at the end of the year assess the performance of PDAM covering the financial, operational, and administrative aspects.</span></p>
