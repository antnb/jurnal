This study shows that the hotel attributes perceived by guests are an important factor in predicting guest satisfaction. In addition, the findings of this study indicate that there is a strong relationship between the overall satisfaction of guests staying at the hotel and the intention to return to stay. Previous research that was used as a review related to brand (hotel) attributes on guest loyalty was written by Yusof </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font2"> (2018).

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Consumer behavior</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Engel, et al in Sangadji and Sopiah (2013) suggest that consumer behavior is an action that is directly involved in obtaining, and consuming products and services, including the process that precedes the action. Consumer behavior is all activities or actions that encourage these actions before purchasing, when purchasing, using and consuming products and services according to Griffin in Sangadji and Sopiah (2013). According to Hasan (2013) consumer behavior is a process that is involved when individuals or groups choose, buy and use products, services, ideas or experiences to satisfy consumer needs or desires. Meanwhile, Schiffman and Kanuk (2012) state that consumer behavior is an action</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">that is directly involved in obtaining and consuming these products and services, including in the decision process that follows this action. Kotler and Keller (2009) define consumer behavior as a study that examines how individuals and groups and organizations choose, buy, and use goods, services or ideas to satisfy consumer needs and desires. Sunyoto (2012) states that consumer behavior is an activity carried out by individuals either directly involved in obtaining and using goods or services which are included in the decision-making process in preparation for determining these activities. According to the definitions presented by the experts, it can be concluded that consumer behavior is a decision taken by individuals, groups or organizations in obtaining or purchasing a product, service, idea or experience.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The variables used in this study are: Latent Variable (Construct), a measure that cannot be measured or is abstract. The latent variable types are as follows: Influential latent variables (exogenous variables) are variables that affect other variables which are marked with the symbol X. The exogenous variables in this study are service quality (X1) and brand attributes (X2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Influential latent variables (endogenous variables) are variables that are influenced by other variables. In this study, there are two types of latent variables that are influenced, namely latent variables that are influenced by moderating intervening with the symbol Y1 (guest satisfaction) and latent variables which are influenced purely by the symbol Y2 (guest loyalty).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Indicators (manifest), are the elements that form latent variables so that they can be measured.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">An implementation of research requires the existence of methods, ways or tactics as steps that must be followed in solving a problem in order to achieve a goal. The method used in this research is quantitative descriptive method. This study uses SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) techniques with mediation effects using SmartPLS software. Some of the tests carried out are as follows: Evaluation of the Measurement Model (Measurement/Outer Model); Structural Model Evaluation (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Structural/Inner Model</span><span class="font2">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>General Characteristics of Respondents</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The characteristics of hotel guests consist of the purpose of guests staying, gender, member program, the main purpose of choosing Le Meridien Bali Jimbaran as a place to stay and the number of times they have stayed at the Le Meridien Bali Jimbaran hotel. The five characteristics of the respondents refer to the research title. The characteristics of respondents based on the purpose of staying were dominated by the purpose of vacationing as much as 72%, the respondent data based on gender were dominated by male guests with a percentage of 64%, while 56% for the percentage who dominated the guest members based on the characteristics according to the member program, characteristics based on the purpose of staying with a value of 39% who chose Le Meridien Bali Jimbaran because the brand they owned was based on the main purpose of choosing Le Me-ridien Bali Jimbaran and based on the frequency of stay, 84% of new guests stayed at the Le Meridien Bali Jimbaran hotel for the first time.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Test of the Validity and Reliability of Research Variables</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Validity and reliability tests in this</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">study were conducted on 100 respondents who were guests staying at the Le Meridien Bali Jimbaran hotel. The validity test was done by looking at the value of Convergent Validity and Discriminant Validity. Convergent Validity was tested by looking at the loading factor value of each indicator on each variable. The loading factor value must also meet the requirements, which is above 0.70. Discriminant Validity was done by comparing the square root of Average Vaariance Extracted (√AVE) in each variable with a correlation between variables and other variables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Table 2 shows that all variables can be said to be valid or good. This is because all variables have an average above 0.50 and the root average value is higher than the variable correlation value. The table above is another method that can be used to measure Discriminant Validity, namely by comparing the square root of the Average Variance Extracted for each variable with the correlation between variables and other variables in the model.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The reliability test results can be measured from the Cronbach Alpha value and the Composite Reliability value from each variable. Each variable can be said to have a high level of reliability if the Cronbach Alpha value exceeds 0.7 and the Composite Reliability value exceeds 0.7. The table above shows that the Cronbach Alpha and Composite Reliability values exceed 0.9, which means that all variables have met good reliability. Based on the results obtained by involving 100 respondents, both Convergent, Discriminant Validity, Cronbach Alpha and Composite Reliability, it can be concluded that the indicators totaling 20 as a measure of the four latent variables are valid and reliable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Based on the results of the research through the Table 7, it can be seen that the indicator of Intent to consider a brand has the highest outer model value, namely 0.986 compared to the other four indicators. In the table that has been presented, it can also be seen that the Intent to recommend Le Meridien brand to family or relatives indicator has the lowest outer model value, which is 0.967. This indicator gets the highest perception, namely 0.011, which in the future gets the highest perception from guests as respondents compared to other indicators. This shows that the Le Meridien brand makes guests have the desire to recommend it to others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Structural model analysis or inner model is carried out to determine the relationship between exogenous variables and endogenous variables which has been the hypothesis of this study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Table 8 shows that there are four direct relationships that occur between one variable and another, but there is one variable with other variables for which there is no direct relationship. The results of the direct effect of exogenous variables on endogenous variables are significantly 1% (0.01), so Ho is rejected if the p-value is &lt;0.05, then the statistical results of the study are as follows</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">H1: Based on the research results, it can be seen that there is a direct influence between service quality and satisfaction with a significant value, namely 0.351, with the original value until the estimate shows a positive number. Thus the hypothesis Ho is rejected while the hypothesis Ha is accepted which states that “Service Quality has a significant effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">H2: The results showed that there was no significant direct influence between service and guest loyalty who stayed at the Le Meridien Bali Jimbaran hotel. Ho is accepted because “Service quality does not have a significant effect on loyalty”, while Ha is rejected because there is no direct influence between service quality and loyalty. The results showed that there was no significant direct influence between service quality and guest loyalty who stayed at the Le Meridien Bali Jimbaran hotel. Ho is accepted because “Service quality does not have a significant effect on loyalty”, while Ha is rejected because there is no direct influence between service quality and loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">H3: The results show that there is a direct influence with the significant value of the original sample estimate is 0.670, thus Ho is rejected while Ha is accepted which states that “Brand attributes have a significant effect on satisfaction.”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">H4: The results showed that brand attributes have a significant effect on loyalty with the original sample value positive estimate 0.160, thus the Ho hypothesis is rejected in this study, while Ha is accepted</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">This study aims to determine the effect of Service Quality and Brand Attributes on the satisfaction and loyalty of guests staying at the Le Meridien Bali Jimbaran hotel. This section will discuss the results of calculations that have been carried out based on the results of the PLS analysis. Testing was done through hypotheses that have been proposed so that we can find out the effect of each variable on the other variables.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Effect of Service Quality on Satisfaction</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the results of the PLS analysis, it shows that service quality has a significant effect on satisfaction (path coefficient of 0.351 with a t-statistic value of 3,814) so that the analysis of the results of this research model shows that good service quality will tend to increase guest satisfaction staying at the Le Meridien Bali hotel Jimbaran. Indirectly or directly, good service quality will be directly proportional to the level of guest satisfaction. Star hotels do not necessarily show that the hotel is able to make the guests staying at the hotel feel satisfied, but when the quality of service has been created properly, it will be able to make these guests satisfied when staying at the hotel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is supported by guest comments when conducting interviews, “all the staff were really nice and helpful, the bedroom was clean”.
