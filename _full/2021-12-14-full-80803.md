<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metaphor</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Metaphor is the process to comparing two different things as if became one thing. Metaphor does not have connective words such as: like, as, then, similar to and seems determining them as figurative (Knickerbocker and Reninger (1963:367))</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Data 1:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“You never meant to say”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Your words are poison”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Alie Gatie: Lost my Lover)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The lyric above is categorized as metonymy due to the usage of the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Poison”. “Poison”</span><span class="font2"> in dictionary means a substance that is capable of causing the illness or death of a living organism when introduced or absorbed. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Poison”</span><span class="font2"> refers to a something painful or negativity. From this song, it can be seen that The songwriter is comparing two things which are his Songwriter’s Former lover’s words and “Poison”. It is said that the songwriter’s former lover’s words is painful to him therefore he is comparing a Poison to the words his former lover said. The Poison here is not meant to bake taken literally because the Poison refers to something painful. The meaning of the lyric is that the songwriter felt so hurt because of the spoken word of his former lover to him.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Data 2:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“But baby, I’m feeling you”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“You’re Heaven and Hell”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Alie Gatie : Lost My Lover)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The lyrics above is using Metaphor because of the words </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Heaven”</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hell”</span><span class="font2">. According to the dictionary Heaven means , a place regarded in various religions as the abode of God (or the gods) and the angels, and of the good after death, often traditionally depicted as being above the sky, while Hell has a meaning of a place regarded in various religions as a spiritual realm of evil and suffering, often traditionally depicted as a place of perpetual fire beneath the earth where the wicked are punished after death. It can be interpreted that the songwriter is talking about his former lover. Even that the songwriter is comparing his former lover with Heaven and Hell, the Words </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Heaven”</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hell”</span><span class="font2"> is not supposed to be taken literally. The word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Heaven”</span><span class="font2"> is to represent Happiness because heaven is also a symbol of peace and joy. Meanwhile, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hell”</span><span class="font2"> on the other hand represents Sadness as it is also the symbol of misery and sufferings. By these, we could understand that the songwriter tells that all his lifetime when he was still be with his former lover, his former lover was his source of Happiness and Sadness. This indicates a figure of speech which is called Metaphor.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Data 3:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“You’re my worst nightmare and favorite dream”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Alie Gatie : :Lost my Lover)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This lyric above is using Metaphor because it compares the songwriter’s former lover with a nightmare and a favorite dream. Firstly, Nightmare in dictionary means a</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">frightening or unpleasant dream while a Favorite dreams means the opposite. The lyrics above compare someone with two opposing things which means that the person that is being compared is very balanced. The songwriter tells that loving his former lover can be very stressful and depressing but also can be very joyful to him. There were so many twists and turns that make the songwriter felt emotional. Feeling scared and panic is normal. But so does feeling happy and delighted. However, if love has a positive impact, pain will be nothing to feel.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irony</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Irony is a statement whose real meaning is completely opposite to its professed. Irony is a figure of speech that gives the meaning which is not true and this is different between appearance and reality. (Knickerbocker and Reninger (1963))</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Data 4:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Since you left me every night, I go stare at the moon”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Alie Gatie: Moonlight)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This lyrics is using Irony because the song lyrics is opposed of the surface meaning. It is said that every night when the songwriter’s partner or lover leaves him, he always go stare at moon. This indicates that when the songwriter hates the night, he instead keep looking for moon in the middle of the night sky. This indicates an Ironical situation. The songwriter went for the situation when he supposedly hate but in terms of Love, he is making himself finding something that has something to do with the night where every time the night time came to him, He felt sad.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperbole</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">According to Knickerbocker and Reninger (1963:367), Hyperbole is an exaggeration used for special effects. Hyperbole is figure of speech that found in everyday life. Hyperbole is deliberating overstatement that is not to be taken literally and seriously as it is used as a mean of highlighting the statement’s truth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Data 5:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Some days you make me feel so happy”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Some days I feel blue</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Alie Gatie: Say to You)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The underlined lyrics of the song above is using a Hyperbole because if we observe much more, the songwriter was exaggerating in creating this overstatement. There is better way to explain his past experience or feelings, for example; the songwriter could use better word to replace </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Blue”</span><span class="font2"> with words such as; Sad, or depressed because </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Blue” </span><span class="font2">in dictionary has a meaning of melancholy, sad, or depressed which is not to be taken literally. But the songwriter chose to use this word therefore this data is labeled as Hyperbole.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Data 6:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“You are my sunshine”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">When my vision is cloudy</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Alie Gatie : Sunshine)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The song lyrics above are categorized into Hyperbole. It can be seen that the underlined sentence above is an overstatement. The songwriter said that his vision is cloudy. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Cloudy”</span><span class="font2"> in dictionary means that covered with or characterized by clouds; overcast. Therefore, in this context, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Cloudy”</span><span class="font2"> should not be taken literally. What the songwriter meant by the lyrics means that the Songwriter is saying that his lover is his happiness when he felt sad with tears in his eyes.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Data 7:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Yeah, I just want to hold you”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Baby, you the one I want”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Alie Gatie : Moonlight)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These lyrics can be categorized into Hyperbole. It can be seen that the statement was created exaggeratingly by the songwriter. It is said in the lyric that the songwriter as the first person perspective would only want one thing in this world, which is his lover. This statement is an overstatement because it is most unlikely to happen because there are some things in the world more precious than his lover such as; a dream house, sports cars, etc. However, even if it is possible that the songwriter only wants his lover, the statement is still exaggerating or in figure of speech would be called Hyperbole.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paradox</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">According to Knickerbocker and Reninger (1963: 367) Paradox is a statement which is contradicting itself but it has obvious meaning that seems illogical, and might sound absurd but still creating senseful upon closure examination.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Data 8:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“It’s difficult to see the light when life is feeling dark”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Alie Gatie : Used to You)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The lyric above is labeled into Paradox because the sentence is contradicting itself. The songwriter tells that it is difficult to see the light when his life is feeling dark. Light and Dark here is contradicting each other. “Light” has the definition of the natural agent that stimulates sight and makes things visible, while “Dark” has the definition of little or no light. This indicates that the lyric is contradicting each other. Figuratively, the meaning behind the lyric is that the songwriter tells that it’s difficult to see the positive things in life when his life is feeling negative by losing his lover.</span></p>
