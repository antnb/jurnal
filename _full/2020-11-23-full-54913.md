<p><span class="font3">This study is aimed at analyzing types and meanings of the compound words in Harry Potter’s: Goblet of Fire. The data were taken using documentation method and note-taking technique. Qualitative method was applied to analyze the data. The theory that was used in identifying the types of compound words is the theory of compound proposed by Lieber (2009). The results showed that there are three types of compound words found in the Harry Potter’s Novel, they are; attributive compound, coordinative compound, and subordinative compound. Based on the second problem, about the analysis of meaning, most of compound words has the general meaning or meaning just like in the dictionary, on the other hand a few compound words are constructed differently in Harry Potter’s novel.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Studi yang berjudul “Compound Word in Harry Potter’s Novel the Goblet of Fire” ditunjukan untuk menganalisis tipe dan makna dari kata majemuk. Data ini diambil menggunakan metode dokumentasi dan teknik pengambilan catatan. Metode qualitative diterapkan untuk menganalisis data. Teori yang digunakan dalam mengidentifikasi jenis kata majemuk adalah teori senyawa yang diusulkan oleh Lieber (2009). Hasil ini menunjukan bahwa ada tiga jenis kata majemuk yang ditemukan dalam novel Harry Potter, yakni: senyawa atributif, senyawa koordinatif, dan senyawa subordinatif. Berdasarkan masalah kedua, tentang analisis makna, sebagian besar kata majemuk memiliki makna atau makna umum seperti pada kamus, di sisi lain beberapa kata majemuk dibangun secara berbeda dalam novel Harry Potter.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Morphology is a linguistic branch that discusses word formation on the use and construction within an utterance context, (Sidupa, 2015). It studies about how the words are built up from the smallest pieces (Rahayu, 2016). It is a study that focuses on how words are formed or constructed. In morphology, there is a process which is called morphological process that plays the most important role to create a new word</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Yanti, 2018). Many languages can form words with a process called compounding. A word itself has a meaning which can be grammatically simple and complex. The simple word is the smallest word only consisting of one single morpheme that has a meaning. While, complex word is word that has internal structure that can be derived into smaller part, while the simple word is the smallest word only consisting of one single morpheme that has a meaning, (Rumiyanti,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">2015). Compound words are words consisting of two or (more) base, roots, and stems. (Lieber, 2009: 43). Compounding has been at the center of interest years and several aspects, compounding as a universal process has been a controversial issue, (Ralli, 2013). Many of the new terms are formed by combining two or more existing words to create new meaning, (Indarto, 2015). Compound word consists of addition of stem in which a word is formed by the combination of two independent words, (Wibowo, 2014). Compounding is also notable for its great productivity, (Séaghdha, 2008). Many new words are formed from compound words. The creations of compound words depend on the creativity that language users have chosen. (Turangan, 2017). In arrange to induce understanding approximately the subject, there are a few past ponders almost morphology, word arrangement, and compound words and those were portrayed and considered having connection to this consider, (Noumianty, 2016). One of those interesting aspects is morphology as it observes the word formation which includes the ways new words are coined in the languages of the world, (Budiarta, 2016). The data were collected by using documentation method, then analyzed the data using qualitative method, and present the analysis by using formal and informal method, (Isnaini, 2019; Angga, 2018; Deleger, 2009).</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>MATERIAL AND METHOD</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The data of this research was taken from Harry Potter Novel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Goblet of Fire</span><span class="font3">. Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British Author J.K Rowling. The book was released on 8 July 2000. Goblet of Fire was the first book of the Harry Potter series released in the US. The novel has 734 pages. The novel tells the story of a tournament held by the Hogwarts School of magic that hosts by inviting two other schools to tighten the fraternity between these three schools, but at the end of the story one of the participants who came from Hogwarts School of magic died that is Cedric, who was a friend of Harry Potter. The book gained great attention after there was a pre-publication leak from Rowling saying that one of the figures would</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">be killed in the book. The reason of choosing this novel as the data, because this novel is a great popular. This novel has a considerable reader. Beside that this novel also has many compound words and the writer really likes to play words and combine them into new words. The method of collecting data in this study was documentation method. There are several kind of technique in documentation such as, note taking, capturing picture, and recording. Note taking is suitable for this kind of research because the data is in a form of a novel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The data were collected by using documentation method, then analyzed the data using qualitative method, and present the analysis by using formal and informal method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THEORETICAL BASIS</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Literature Riview</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">There are jurnal articles that has been riviewed are related to compound words. Morphology is learning about morpheme and morpheme is the element of language that have meaning and also support the meaning, (Yusuf, 2017; Haryati, 2014). Compound words are one of the elements found in the field of morphology, (Ihsan, 2019). </span><span class="font3">In English, when the compound word builds up, not only the types of compound words which are varied but also their meanings, it might have confused people who are not native speaker. Language also has meaning. Language makes people understand each statement, (Nur, 2016). Language is a tool of communication to send ideas, feeling, and message, (Cahyanti, 2016; Rosa, 2012).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In linguistic it is a processof word formation that is very productive in which two or more words are combined into a new word, (Sari, 2013). Compounding is one of the processes in language formation, (Hadiati, 2011). </span><span class="font4">Compound words employed a productive role in this language, (Fan, 2014). </span><span class="font3">This study was relevant to be reviewed in order to give a better understanding about concept of compound word, since it also explained</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">about categorization of compound words, which was related with the first problem.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>RESULT AND DISCUSSION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">In compound words, there some ways to identify a compound word such as: first, the stress pattern of the compound word is usually different from the stress pattern in the phrase composed of the same words in the same order. It means that the main stress of in the phrase is on the last word. While this pattern does not apply to all compounds, it is so generally true that it provides a very useful test. The first discussion in this data is classifying the types of compound words found in Harry Potter’s Novel. There are three types of compound words in Lieber (2009) theory such as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Attributive Compound</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In attributive compound the non-head acts as a head modifier in an attributive compound.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Data 1</span><span class="font4">.</span></h3>

<p><span class="font3">Compound </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">firelight</span><span class="font3"> is formed by two words including </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fire</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">light</span><span class="font3">. They are free morphemes that belong to the same word category that is noun, and they can stand alone as a word. The construction of the compound is shown by tree diagram below:</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/54913-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:183pt;height:113pt;">
<p><span class="font3">Furthermore, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">firelight</span><span class="font3"> is defined as the attributive compound because the first element could express just about any relationship with the head or the second element. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fire</span><span class="font3"> as the non-head of this attributive modifies the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">light</span><span class="font3"> as the head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">firelight</span><span class="font3"> could also be included in endocentric variation because in endocentric, the referent of the compound is the same as the referent of the head. Therefore, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">firelight</span><span class="font3"> is a kind of light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Semantically, the meaning of the compound can be interpreted by identifying the modification done by non-head towards the head. Non-head </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fire</span><span class="font3"> modifies the meaning of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">light</span><span class="font3">. The relationship lying between those two is that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fire</span><span class="font3"> is the source of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">light</span><span class="font3">. Thus, the compound </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">firelight</span><span class="font3"> means the light of a fire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Compound </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deathbed</span><span class="font3"> is formed by two words including </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">death</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bed</span><span class="font3">. They are free morphemes that belong to the same word category that is noun, and they can stand alone as a word. The construction of the compound is shown by tree diagram below:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark21"></a>death bed</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Furthermore, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deathbed</span><span class="font3"> is defined as the attributive compound because the first element could express just about any relationship with the head or the second element. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">death</span><span class="font3"> as the non-head of this attributive modifies the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bed</span><span class="font3"> as the head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deathbed</span><span class="font3"> could also be included in endocentric variation because in endocentric, the referent of the compound is the same as the referent of the head.

<p><span class="font3">Semantically, the meaning of the compound can be interpreted by identifying the modification done by non-head towards the head. Non-head </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">death</span><span class="font3"> modifies the meaning of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bed</span><span class="font3">.

<p><span class="font3">of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bed</span><span class="font3">. Thus, the compound </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deathbed </span><span class="font3">means a bed on which dead person lies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Coordinative Compound</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first element of the compound does not alter the second in coordinative compounds; instead, the two have equal weight.</span></p>

Thus, the compound </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rule</span><span class="font3">-</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">breaking</span><span class="font3"> means a rule-breaking that someone wants to do.</span></p>
