<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">This study is aimed to identify the types of compound nouns and analyze the meanings of compound nouns conveyed on The Jakarta Post website. Two theories applied in this study, the theory of compound proposed by Katamba and the theory of meaning proposed by Palmer. Eight articles from The Jakarta Post website were chosen as the data source. The selected articles are related to technology, lifestyle, and business from December 2020 until February 2021</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Documentation method and note-taking technique used in collecting the data. The collected data was analyzed by using a descriptive qualitative method and triangulation technique. Meanwhile, in presenting the data analysis, this study used formal and informal methods. The result shows that all types of compound nouns based on the theory applied are found in the data source. The types are: noun + noun, adjective + noun, and preposition + noun. In terms of meaning, there are transparent and opaque meanings.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Morphology</span><span class="font3"> is the process that refers to the part of the grammar that is concerned with words and word formation stated by O'Grady and Guzman (1996). This process includes the ways new words are coined in the world's languages (Lieber, 2009). Morphology deals with words, their internal structure, and how they formed (Aronoff and Fudeman, 2011). Nowadays people are readily accepting new things, including written or spoken word formation, because of globalization's influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Globalization is the growth or development of the world's economics, technologies, cultures, and even population. The field that is experiencing the fastest globalization is technology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the benefits that affect people nowadays can be seen in information and communication technology. People can access information everywhere they want to through various media, such as; television, radio, newspapers, etc. The news that is not printed is called digital news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the digital news websites is The Jakarta Post. The articles on this website contain new words related to the word-formation process, especially compounding. Compounding is the process of putting words together to build a new one that does not denote two things, but one and that is pronounced as one unit (Wisniewski, 2007). The common types of compounds are</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">compound nouns, compound adjectives, and compound verbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A compound noun is made up of at least two constituents, which different word classes of constituents can form. Katamba (1993) stated that compound nouns might appear in different types. The compound nouns consist of any word classes followed by a noun. Furthermore, a compound noun is the way toward combining words into solitary word and makes them mean. However, the meaning of the elements might be lost and framed another meaning. The compound processes do not just carry on framing words yet additionally examine the implications. The meaning of the compound noun sometimes can and cannot be identified from its constituents (Palmer, 1981).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Among the other types of compound words, compound nouns are interesting since they are the most frequent types of compound used either in utterance or written. The Jakarta Post website is chosen as the data source because the digital news provides many compound nouns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In light of the above explanation, it is energizing and valuable to talk about compound noun. This study focused on identifying and analyzing the types of compound nouns and their meanings found on The Jakarta Post website.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>METHOD AND THEORY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The data of this study is digital data and was taken from The Jakarta Post website. The Jakarta Post can be accessed on its website</span><a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/"><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">www.thejakartapost.com</span></a><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font3">through mobile phone or computer. In this study, the news text related to technology, lifestyle, and business from December 2020 until February 2021 was used as the data source. The reason for choosing the articles from The Jakarta Post website is that it contains compound</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">words, especially compound nouns that relevant to the topic of this study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Documentation method was used to collect the data source from The Jakarta Post website. Next, the technique of collecting data was done by taking notes and classifying them into compound nouns. The process of collecting data was done by specific techniques. First, selecting the articles from The Jakarta Post website, then printing them out. Second, reading the articles carefully to find out the compound words which belong to compound noun. Third, making the highlights of the articles, which were considered as compound nouns. Last, taking notes of the articles that have been marked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The collected data was analyzed using the descriptive qualitative method. This study also used the triangulation technique, which means the data were checked a couple of times to see the validity of the data (Creswell, 2017). The cross-checking data was carried out based on the theories applied. First, the data was classified into some types of compound nouns using the theory of compound proposed by Katamba (1993). Furthermore, the compound nouns that had been classified were analyzed based on their meanings using the theory from Palmer (1981).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The data analysis was presented using formal and informal methods. In presenting the data, a few stages are taken. To start with, the data analysis was calssified into types of compound nouns. Second, each of the data was presented in a tree diagram to show its components. Last, an explanation of the type and meaning was elaborated below the tree diagram in a paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several articles are related to the topic of this study. An article related to this topic entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">English Compound Nouns in Short Story “The Star-Child” by Oscar Wilde</span><span class="font3"> written by Pratiwi</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(2018). This article used the theory of compound words by Katamba (1993), which was partitioned into three kinds dependent on the semantic head. There are exocentric, endocentric, and copulative. Her article also used the theory of meaning proposed by Palmer (1981) to explain the meanings of compound nouns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second article entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Compound Words Found in SeventySeven Thousand Service-Trees (Sri Chinmoy)</span><span class="font3"> written by Damayanti (2020). Her article aimed to describe the types and the construction of compound words. Two theories were applied in her article, theory by Booij (2007) and McCarthy (2002). The result showed that compound noun is the most successive type that occurred in the data source and based on its form, there was a solid and hyphenated form of compound words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another article was published in an international journal entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Indonesian-English Compound Word Equivalence </span><span class="font3">written by Hikmaharyanti (2020). This article aimed to analyze Indonesian-English compound words translation equivalence since both had different classifications and characteristics to be investigated. She used the novels of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lelaki Harimau</span><span class="font3"> and the English version of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Man Tiger</span><span class="font3"> as the data source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This study applied two theories in analyzing the data. First, the theory of compound nouns by Katamba (1993). A compound noun can be defined as a type of compound word with a noun as its head, whether the head appears at the left or the right of the compound. Katamba (1993:305) stated that compound noun consists of three sub principles;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noun followed by another noun (Noun + Noun)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An adjective followed by a noun (Adjective + Noun)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A preposition followed by a noun (Preposition + Noun).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In order to give an understanding of the meanings of compound nouns, this study also applied the theory of meaning proposed by Palmer (1981). Palmer, in his book, divided meaning into two types; transparent and opaque meaning. Transparent meaning is the meaning of the words that can be determined from the meaning of each part. Meanwhile, opaque meaning is not predictable to be determined from the meaning of its constituents.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>RESULT AND DISCUSSION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">This part presents results and discussions of the data from The Jakarta Post website which has been analyzed based on the types of compound nouns by Katamba (1993) and it is additionally trailed by the examinations of meanings contained in compound nouns including transparent and opaque meaning based on the theory of meaning by Palmer (1981).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compound Noun + Noun</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Compound noun is a type of compound word that consists of a noun followed by another noun (Katamba, 1993). In this type of compound, the head may appear at the left or the right of a compound. As stated by Booij (2002), compounding is the most frequently used way of making a new lexeme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Example 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Landmark (N)</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/72790-2.png" alt="" style="width:61pt;height:33pt;">
<p><span class="font3">Land (N) Mark (N)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Morphologically, the compound word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">landmark</span><span class="font3"> is formed by combining two independent words; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">land</span><span class="font3"> (N) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mark</span><span class="font3"> (N). Both of the words framed another word that has a place to a compound noun with the ‘Noun + Noun’ pattern. As indicated by Plag (2003), noun + noun pattern is the most widely recognized kind of compound. The word</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mark</span><span class="font3"> functioned as the head, while the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">land</span><span class="font3"> as a modifier. It means that the head appears on the right. The compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">landmark</span><span class="font3"> is a closed compound because another follows the first component without space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">land</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mark</span><span class="font3"> have distinct meanings. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">land</span><span class="font3"> can be defined as a solid part of the earth’s surface that does not contain water. Meanwhile, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mark</span><span class="font3"> has a lexical meaning as a spot or line with a different color in some ways. After these words combine and form a new compound noun, it has one meaning which cannot be identified from its components. Since the meaning of the compound noun cannot be resolved from its parts, it includes to an opaque meaning (Palmer, 1981). The compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">landmark </span><span class="font3">can be defines as ‘an object or building that can easily be seen from distances.’ Example 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Showcase (N)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Show (N) Case (N)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">showcase </span><span class="font3">consists of two parts; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">show</span><span class="font3"> (N) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">case </span><span class="font3">(N). The two words are joined and framed another word that belongs to compound noun with ‘Noun + Noun’ pattern. As stated by Katamba (1993), the compound noun has a head and usually appears on the right. In the compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">showcase</span><span class="font3">, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">case</span><span class="font3"> functioned as the head and the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">show</span><span class="font3"> as a modifier. It shows that the head appears at the right. The compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">showcase</span><span class="font3"> can be classified as a closed compound since the words are melded together, forming a single new word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Semantically, the words </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">show</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">case</span><span class="font3"> have distinct meanings. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">show</span><span class="font3"> means a performance whose purpose is to entertain the audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whereas the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">case</span><span class="font3"> can be determined as a box to place something. After these two words are combined and framed another word with one importance. Since the meaning can be distinguished from its constituents, it classifies to transparent meaning. The compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">showcase</span><span class="font3"> can be defined as ‘a box made of glass to display valuable objects.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Example 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Motor skill (N)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Motor (N) Skill (N)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">motor skill </span><span class="font3">consists of two words; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">motor</span><span class="font3"> (N) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">skill</span><span class="font3"> (N). Combining these words framed another word that includes in a compound noun with ‘Noun + Noun’ pattern (Katamba, 1993). It has the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">skill</span><span class="font3"> as the head, while the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">motor</span><span class="font3"> as a modifier. The compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">motor skill</span><span class="font3"> can be sorted as an open compound by reason of it consists of two words forming a single new term separated by a space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">motor</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">skill</span><span class="font3"> have different lexical meanings. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">motor</span><span class="font3"> can be determined as a machine that changes electricity or fuel into motion and makes machines work. Meanwhile, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">skill</span><span class="font3"> means an ability to do an action with a good result. Furthermore, these words are grouped and formed compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">motor skill</span><span class="font3">, meaning ‘an ability involves precise movement to perform a specific act.’ From the meaning, the compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">motor skill</span><span class="font3"> has a transparent meaning because the meaning can be identified from its elements.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compound Adjective + Noun</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The second type of compound noun consists of an adjective followed by a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">noun. This type of compound has a noun as the head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Example 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Deep pocket (N)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Deep (Adj) Pocket (N)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Scalise (2010) stated that compound word is the combination of lexemes into larger words. In this case, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deep pocket</span><span class="font3"> is formed by combining two parts; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deep </span><span class="font3">(Adj) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pocket</span><span class="font3"> (N), and formed a compound noun with ‘Adjective + Noun’ pattern. In light of its form, the compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deep pocket</span><span class="font3"> can be sorted as an open compound since there is a space between the first and the followed components. It has a noun as the head and appears at the right, while the adjective functioned as a modifier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deep</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pocket</span><span class="font3"> have a distinct meaning. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deep</span><span class="font3"> means a position far down from the top or surface. Whereas the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pocket</span><span class="font3"> can be determined as a tiny pouch sewn on clothes used to put small articles. Furthermore, these words are grouped and formed compound noun with one meaning where it cannot be identified from its constituents (Palmer, 1981). The compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deep pocket</span><span class="font3"> means ‘an organization or company with extensive or substantial financial resources’ and belongs to opaque meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Example 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Superstar (N)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Super (Adj) Star (N)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the tree diagram above, the compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">superstar</span><span class="font3"> is formed by combining two words; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">super</span><span class="font3"> (Adj) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">star</span><span class="font3"> (N). Both words have different word classes. It framed another word that classifies to a compound noun with</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘Adjective + Noun’ pattern. Long established and lexicalized compounds tend to be written as one word (Szymanek, 1989). The compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">superstar</span><span class="font3"> sorted as a closed compound since the words are connected without space. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">star</span><span class="font3"> functioned as the head, while the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">super</span><span class="font3"> as a modifier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Semantically, both words </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">super</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">star</span><span class="font3"> have different lexical meanings. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">super</span><span class="font3"> means outstanding or excellent, while the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">star</span><span class="font3"> can be defined as a giant ball of burning gas seen as a small light in the night sky. Furthermore, these words joined and formed compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">superstar</span><span class="font3"> which has a different meaning from its elements. Some compound nouns cannot be predicted from the meaning of their parts (Indrawati, 2013). Since the meaning cannot be identified from its elements, it includes in opaque meaning. The compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">superstar</span><span class="font3"> can be determined as ‘someone is successful, excellent, and widely known in their field.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Example 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Long-run (N)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Long (Adj) Run (N)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the tree diagram above, the compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">long-run</span><span class="font3"> is the combination of two words; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">long</span><span class="font3"> (Adj) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">run</span><span class="font3"> (N). The two words framed another word that classifies to a compound noun with ‘Adjective + Noun’ pattern. English has a productive rule of forming compound nouns, consisting of an adjective followed by a noun, as appears in this analysis (Bennett, 2002). The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">run</span><span class="font3"> functioned as the head and the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">long</span><span class="font3"> as a modifier. In view of its form, the compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">long-run </span><span class="font3">sorted as a hyphenated compound since it</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">has a hyphen (-) used to join parts of the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lyons (1977) stated that meaning is a word of the ordinary, everyday vocabulary of English. In terms of meaning, the words </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">long</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">run</span><span class="font3"> have different lexical meanings. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">long</span><span class="font3"> can be determined as a significant amount of time. In contrast, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">run </span><span class="font3">means a continuous period of things. Furthermore, these words are grouped and formed compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">long-run, </span><span class="font3">meaning ‘an extended period.’ Since the meaning of the compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">long-run </span><span class="font3">can be identified from its constituents, it classifies to transparent meaning.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compound Preposition + Noun</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The last type of compound nouns based on the theory proposed by Katamba (1993) is a compound noun with ‘Preposition + Noun’ pattern. Example 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Outlook (N)</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/72790-3.png" alt="" style="width:60pt;height:33pt;">
<p><span class="font3">Out (Prep) Look (N)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A compound is a word that contains two or more other words (Leech, 2006). The compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">outlook</span><span class="font3"> contains two independent words, namely </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out </span><span class="font3">(Prep) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">look</span><span class="font3"> (N). Later on, those words shaped another compound word that falls under to the compound noun with ‘Preposition + Noun’ pattern. English compound words are mostly Right-headed (Altakhaineh, 2019). In the compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">outlook</span><span class="font3">, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">look </span><span class="font3">functioned as the head, while the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out</span><span class="font3"> as a modifier. In view of its form, it can be classified as a closed compound since the first word is followed by another without space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the meaning, each of the components has a different meaning. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out</span><span class="font3"> can be determined as away from the inside of a place or position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Meanwhile, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">look</span><span class="font3"> can be defined as the physical appearance of someone or something in particular. After these words are grouped and formed a compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">outlook,</span><span class="font3"> its meaning is ‘an attitude of someone towards life.’ The meaning is easy to be determined from its elements (Palmer, 1981). Therefore, it belongs to transparent meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Example 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Outbreak (N)</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/72790-4.png" alt="" style="width:60pt;height:33pt;">
<p><span class="font3">Out (Prep) Break (N)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Compounding is the process by which a compound lexeme is derived from two or simpler lexeme (Matthews, 1996). From the tree diagram above, the compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">outbreak</span><span class="font3"> consists of two lexemes, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out</span><span class="font3"> (Prep) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">break</span><span class="font3"> (N). Both words formed a new compound noun with the ‘Preposition + Noun’ pattern. The head appears at the right, and the left constituent functioned as a modifier. Cited from Cahyanti (2016), compounds may consist of two or more lexeme stems that are aligned in a single word form. It can be categorized as a closed compound since the compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">outbreak</span><span class="font3"> is melded together, forming a single word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Semantically, both words have different lexical meanings. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">out </span><span class="font3">can be determined as away from the inside of a place or position. Meanwhile, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">break</span><span class="font3"> means a short period of rest in the middle of activities. Furthermore, these words formed a compound noun with one meaning that cannot be defined from its constituents. Since the meaning is different from its constituents, it falls under to an opaque meaning. The compound noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">outbreak </span><span class="font3">can be defined as ‘a sudden start of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">something terrible, especially disease or catastrophe.’</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>CONCLUSIONS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the previous analysis, this study focused on identifying the types of compound nouns using the theory by Katamba (1993) and analyzing the meaning of compound nouns using the theory by Palmer (1981). Some points can be drawn as conclusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the three types of compound nouns based on the theory proposed by Katamba (1993) are found in eight articles on The Jakarta Post website. They are a noun followed by another noun (Noun + Noun), an adjective followed by a noun (Adjective + Noun), and a preposition followed by a noun (Preposition + Noun).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Moreover, there are two meanings of compound nouns found in the data source. Transparent meaning is the meaning of the words that can be determined from the meaning of each part. Meanwhile, opaque meaning is not predictable to be determined from the meaning of its constituents.</span></p>
