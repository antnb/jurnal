<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Abstract</span><span class="font3"> - This study investigated English-Indonesian translation of existential sentence. It aimed at (1) Identifying the way of translating English existential sentences into Indonesian and (2) Investigating kinds of translation shift found in the translation of English existential sentences into Indonesian. Existential sentence is a non-canonical sentence used to express the existence of something or someone marked by dummy subject </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">there</span><span class="font3"> and copula </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">be.</span><span class="font3"> Here, the English existential sentences were translated into the inversion structure in Indonesian with V-NP word order. The structure preserved the existential content by placing Indonesian existential verbs in the initial position of the sentences, there were two most frequently used verbs, those are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">terdapat.</span><span class="font3"> Both verbs can be substituted to present the same ideas. Since English and Indonesian have different language structure, translation shift in term of structure shift was found in translating existential sentences from English into Indonesian.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Existential sentence is a non-canonical sentence used to express a proposition about the existence or the presence of someone or something (Francez 2007). The existential </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">there</span><span class="font3"> serves as a dummy subject that fulfils the grammatical function of subject. However this dummy subject does not fulfil the semantic function of the subject found in the sentence. English existential sentence is a sentence that asserts the existence or non-existence of something or someone. This sentence is marked by existential </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">there</span><span class="font3"> followed by a form of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">be.</span><span class="font3"> This sentence provides the highlight in a clause as a whole and presenting new piece of information to the audience since the development of this construction is related with information structure and also thematization process which focused on certain elements of information found in the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Indonesian, there is a comparable form of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">there</span><span class="font3">-existential sentence. This sentence is formed as the result of the existential process and sentence transformation that caused the inverted form of the sentence. This inversion form is started by the existential verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> (exist) to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">24</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/45945-1.png" alt="" style="width:68pt;height:37pt;">
<p><span class="font3">present the existence of certain entity or individual in the sentence. The verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> has similar meaning with the verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">terdapat,</span><span class="font3"> so that this verb can substitute the verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> in the translation of English existential sentence into Indonesian. Since English existential sentence is a contextdependent sentence, it is interesting to analyze its translation in Indonesian since English and Indonesian have different language structures. This differentiation can result in different way in presenting the existence of a certain entity. Besides, the different structures found in both language can result in shift in the translation process. So, this study was also considered with the translation shift analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This study focused on the translation of English existential sentences found in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Intelligent Investor</span><span class="font3"> into Indonesian. There are two main problems that were discussed in this study, namely (1) how the existential sentences were translated into Indonesian? And (2) What kinds of translation shift are found in the translation of English existential sentences into Indonesian?</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This study was a qualitative research. The data were taken from a book entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Intelligent Investor</span><span class="font3"> which was written by Benjamin Graham (2006) and its translation into Indonesian translated by Rachmat Febrianto and Kurniawan Abdulah. The investigation conducted in this study was divided into two, first, investigation on the sentence variations found in the translation of English existential sentences into Indonesian, and the translation shift found in the English – Indonesian translation of existential sentences. The method applied in this study was observation method. It was conducted through note-taking technique and the classification of the data was based on the theory applied in this study. Those are Translation Shift theory proposed by Catford (1965) and Existential Sentences proposed by Quirk et al (1985). There were 84 existential sentences observed as the data. Those sentences were comprehensively classified in accordance to their translation variations in presenting the existential ideas in Indonesian. There were four different Indonesian sentence variations used in presenting the existential information found in the existential sentences into Indonesian. Since English and Indonesian have different language structure the shift in translation was also found in the analysis.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There are 84 existential sentences observed as the data found in the book entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Intelligent Investor.</span><span class="font3"> English existential construction was translated into different forms in the data, as shown in the following table:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The English existential sentences were translated into different structures in Indonesian. There were two dominant translation variations discussed in this paper, those are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3">-existential sentence and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">terdapat</span><span class="font3">-existential sentence. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ada-existential</span><span class="font3"> structure is a sentence that has an existential verb. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ada</span><span class="font3"> was found in the initial position of the sentence to present the existence or the occurrence of an entity in the form of inversion structure with V-NP word order. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Terdapat</span><span class="font3"> is another Indonesian verb that was used to express the existential information which is also written in inversion structure with V-NP word order. Both </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">terdapat</span><span class="font3"> have similar meaning to express the existence or occurrence of a certain entity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">English existential construction was developed to serve the idea about the existence of a certain entity or individual. The existential </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">there</span><span class="font3"> serves as a dummy subject that fulfils the grammatical function of the subject. This condition influenced the variations of the Indonesian translation. English existential sentences were translated into Indonesian in the form of inverted sentences which presented the existential information by transforming the form of sentences through fronting the existential verb such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">terdapat</span><span class="font3"> in the beginning of the sentence. The Indonesian existential verb helped the sentence in maintaining the existential ideas from the source language. The entity presented by this sentence can be found after the existential verb and this form was known as notional subject in the English existential sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">26</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/45945-4.png" alt="" style="width:68pt;height:37pt;">
<p><span class="font3">The English existential sentences were randomly chosen to present the comparison between English-Indonesian translations of existential sentences. The variation of English existential sentences found in the data source can be seen in the following examples:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(1.A) There are two catches to his simple ideas (page 158)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(2.A) There is a paradoxical aspect to these developments. Page 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those two examples represent the idea that owned by English existential sentence especially in term of the pattern of existential sentence, that is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">There + be + indefinite NP+Adv</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The examples (1.A) and (2.A) were classified as extending or complex existentials. These sentences contain </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">there,</span><span class="font3"> the verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">be,</span><span class="font3"> notional subject and were followed by adverbial expansion. As what were found in the examples (1.A) and (2.A) the adverbial expansion was in form of prepositional phrase that followed the notional subject. These two existential sentences were translated into Indonesian by using the inversion structure. The translation of sentence (1.A) can be found in sentence (1.B) and the translation for sentence (2.A) can be found in sentence (2.B) below. The sentences were started by Indonesian existential verb, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> to maintain and present the existential information found in the source text in the target language text. The occurrence of Indonesian existential verb in the beginning of the sentence has a function to signal the existence or occurrence of an entity, like their English counterparts.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(1.B)</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada dua jebakan dalam ide sederhana ini</span><span class="font3"> (page 212)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(2.B)</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada suatu aspek paradoksal dalam perkembangan-perkembangan ini.</span><span class="font3"> (page 32)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">As can be seen on the sentences above, both sentence (1.B) and sentence (2.B) were in the form of inversion structure with V-FN word order. These sentences had the Indonesian existential verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> in the initial position of the sentence preceding the subject of the sentences. This existential verb was transformed to the initial position of the sentence to provide a corresponded idea of existential found in the source language sentences. The subject in the form of noun phrase naming the entity comes immediately after the Indonesian existential verb. They are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dua jebakan</span><span class="font3"> in sentence (1.B) as the translation of SL noun phrase </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">two catches,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">suatu aspek paradoksal</span><span class="font3"> in sentence (2.B) was the translation of SL noun phrase </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">paradoxical aspect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Comparing the form of English-Indonesian existential sentence structure, it was found that there was a shift in translating the English existential marker </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">there</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">be</span><span class="font3"> into an existential verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> in Indonesian. According to Huddleston and Pullum (2002) existential sentence has the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">27</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/45945-5.png" alt="" style="width:68pt;height:37pt;">
<p><span class="font3">word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">there</span><span class="font3"> as a marker of the grammatical construction serving to fill the subject position. There was structure shift occurred in translating dummy subject and copula into an existential subject in Indonesian, since the language structures in both languages were different. Besides, Indonesian has no similar concept like dummy subject </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">there</span><span class="font3"> found in English existential sentence. Indonesian existential sentence has no corresponding idea to this dummy subject but replaces the way in presenting the existential idea using the existential verb found in Indonesian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another variation of existential verb found in Indonesian translation of existential sentence is the verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">terdapat.</span><span class="font3"> Both verbs </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">terdapat</span><span class="font3"> can be substituted and presented the same idea of existential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(3.A) There are many ways in which speculation maybe unintelligent (page 21)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(3.B)</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terdapat banyak situasi yang menjadikan spekulasi bukan tindakan pintar</span><span class="font3"> (page 29) (4.A) There was a substantial temporary depreciation at market value (page 118)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(4.B)</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terdapat depresiasi temporer substansial pada nilai pasar</span><span class="font3"> (page 160)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(5.A) There is another contrast that comes to mind (page 392)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(5.B)</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terdapat keganjilan lain yang harus direnungkan (page 521)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">There were three examples of English existential sentences which were chosen randomly. These sentences were translated into Indonesian inversion sentences, which were marked by Indonesian existential verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">terdapat.</span><span class="font3"> These existential sentences are in the form of extended existential sentences characterized by adverbial expansions. Sentences (3.A) and (4.A) were extended by the prepositional phrase, meanwhile sentence (5.A) has relative clause expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sentence (3.A) has copula be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font3"> which is related to the notional subject many ways. The copula </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font3"> used in this sentence provided two information, those are the tense use in this sentence, that is present tense and the notional subject of the sentence is in plural form. Sentence (4.A) has copula </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">was</span><span class="font3"> which shows this sentence uses past tense and is followed by singular notional subject, that is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a substantial temporary depreciation.</span><span class="font3"> Meanwhile, sentence (5A) has copula </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font3"> as the sentence is in present tense and has singular notional subject </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">another contrast. </span><span class="font3">Based on the above examples, shift in translating the English existential marker into Indonesian was found. The shift was in the form of structure shift, which involved the shift from the dummy subject into existential verb in Indonesian to present the existential information in target language, since there is no one to one corresponds in the target language for translating dummy subject with the same form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">28</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/45945-6.png" alt="" style="width:68pt;height:37pt;">
<p><span class="font3">The notional subject in English existential constructions can be an indefinite noun phrase, as shown in sentence (2.A) and (4.A). The notional subjects found in sentences (2.A) and (4.A) have a singular noun as the head of the noun phrase. These notional subjects were translated into Indonesian noun phrase with the same meaning in sentence (2.B) and (4.B). However only sentence (2.B) provided correspondence form for the indefinite article </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3">, that is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">suatu,</span><span class="font3"> while sentence (4.B) omit the correspondence for the indefinite article </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3">. even though these sentences have different way in translating the notional subjects, both translation of noun phrase still maintain the singularity of the noun phrase in the target language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the English existential sentences the used of quantifier was also found. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Many</span><span class="font3"> in sentence (3A) modifies the notional subject </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">many ways.</span><span class="font3"> On the Indonesian translation the correspondence of this English quantifier was found that is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">banyak.</span><span class="font3"> This form substituted the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">many</span><span class="font3"> in the target language to present the existence of plural entity </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">banyak situasi. </span><span class="font3">Indonesian structure in the previous examples provided two ways in presenting the noun plurality, those are by placing the quantifier such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">banyak</span><span class="font3"> as found in translating </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">many</span><span class="font3"> and by reduplicating the noun without any quantifier as found in translating the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">developments</span><span class="font3"> into </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">perkembangan-perkembangan</span><span class="font3"> in sentence (2.B)</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Relative clause is one of extended form used to expand and qualify a notional subject as found in sentence (5.A). The translation of sentence (5.A) into (5.B) contains two verbs, those are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">terdapat ‘exist’</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">direnungkan ‘thought out’</span><span class="font3">. This construction has two properties, namely (1) the indefinite noun phrase and (2) second clause provided a description of the noun phrase. The translation of this existential sentence (5.A) shows the same properties in the target language (5.B), those are the indefinite noun phrases and also the second clause in form of relative clause </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">yang</span><span class="font3"> to provide description about the preceding noun phrase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the previous explanations, both Indonesian counterparts of existential sentences used existential verbs </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">terdapat</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> consistently using V-NP word order. The noun phrase naming the entity comes after the existential verbs </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">terdapat.</span><span class="font3"> The difference between English and Indonesian existential sentences lies in the condition that dummy subject occurred in the English existential sentence has no corresponding form in their Indonesian translation. Instead of using the dummy subject, the existential information was presented in indonesian by using existential verbs, such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">terdapat.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Existential sentence is a non-canonical sentence used to express a proposition about the existence or the presence of certain entity.

It is apparent that the dummy subject </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">there</span><span class="font3"> and copula </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">be</span><span class="font3"> were translated into the Indonesian existential verbs such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ada</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">terdapat</span><span class="font3">. There is a structure shift occurred from the dummy subject and copula into a verb since there is no dummy subject concept found in the target language. In order to maintain the information carried out by the source language sentence, there applies the inversion structure with the existential verb in Indonesian. Besides, there is also a shift from the English existential sentence structure into inversion structure in Indonesian.</span></p>
