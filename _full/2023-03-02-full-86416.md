Bali cattle are one of the native Indonesian cattle that have great potential as a meat producer The potential population of Bali cattle in Gerokgak with existing supporting facilities is the reason for the importance of continuous selection so that the genetic quality of individuals can be improved selection can be done through measurement quantitative This study aims to determine the diversity and correlation between circumference dimensions of bali cattle
