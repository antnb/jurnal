<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are various factors that cause tourists’ happiness. There are tourists who are happy because of the influence of hedonic, spiritual, social, cultural, psychological, economic, and including eudaimonic values. All of the factors that cause happiness, one of the important factors that need to be explored in determining the happiness of foreign tourists is the eudaimonic value. For tourists, this eudaimonic value is related to various aspects of tourism services in the context of achieving happiness. Despite this, the effect of this eudaimonic value in particular on service products, satisfaction and happiness of foreign tourists when traveling to Bali is not yet clear. Having the background, the objective of this study is to prove the effect of eudaimonic value on product services, examine the effect of eudaimonic value on tourist satisfaction, prove the effect of product service on tourist satisfaction, and examine the effect of tourist satisfaction on the psychological happiness of foreign tourists in Bali. This study took a sample of 171 respondents, namely foreign tourists who traveled to Bali. The analysis method uses SEM (Structural Equation Model). Based on the results of the analysis, the research findings are as follows: the value of eudaimonic has a positive and significant effect on the service product, the value of eudaimon-ic has a positive and significant effect on tourist satisfaction, the service product has a positive and significant effect on tourist satisfaction, and tourist satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on tourist psychology well-being. Based on the results of the four tests, these findings can formulate a model of eudaimonic tourist happiness in Bali which is acronymized with the term MTES (Model of Tourists Eudaiminic Happiness). The conclusion of this research is MTES which covers the happiness of foreign tourists in Bali consisting of aspects of eudaimonic value, the service product, tourist satisfaction, and psychology of tourist well being. This study has limitations in terms of the number of test variables because there are still relatively many variables as determinants of the happiness of foreign tourists who travel to Bali. For this reason, further research is recommended to test with other foreign tourists variables such as the characteristics of foreign tourists, length of stay, and the desire to visit again to test the happiness of eudaimonic tourists in Bali.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The relationship between happiness and tourists is interesting to study considering that all tourism activities carried out by foreign tourists certainly want happiness. As Hanh (2005) review; Old (2009); Liu (2013); Prama (2013) which states that the main goal of humans is to achieve happiness. Even Stone (2012) explicitly reviews that traveling is a search for the experience of happiness. For this purpose of happiness, tourists are willing to spend relatively large money and travel long distances, because they only want to find or get happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regarding the happiness of traveling, there are several studies that have been carried out by several researchers. For example, Xiong (2011) reviews the happiness of tourists in ethical and psychological approaches. Filep &amp;&nbsp;Deery (2010) explores tourist happiness associated with positive emotions. Bimonte &amp;&nbsp;Faralla (2012) examines the types of tourists who compare the happiness of tourists in Meremma Italy. Furthermore, Cor-vo (2011) reviews the happiness side of tourists in the realm of global tourists. In addition, another study that reviews tourist happiness was also carried out by Gillet et al. (2016) who examined the relationship between photography and the level of tourist happiness. Filep (2008) measures the level of tourist satisfaction with a happiness approach from a positive psychological perspective. McCabe &amp;&nbsp;Johnson (2013) explores tourist happiness from the determinants of happiness in terms of subjective (personal) happiness and social tourism. Nawijn (2011) examines the determination of tourist happiness when traveling. Chen &amp;&nbsp;Li (2018) focuses on the study of tourist happiness (inbound tourism) which is associated with the level of community happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pearce (2009) explores the study of tourist behavior associated with happiness based on a positive psychological perspective, and Matteucci &amp;&nbsp;Filep (2017) examines the happiness experience of eudaimonic tourists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The importance of meaning of tourist happiness in the current era and the high interest of researchers to study happiness seen from of tourists and tourism perspectives. Therefore, it is important to conduct the research on the topic of tourist happiness in Bali. In the case of the happiness of foreign tourists in Bali, there are theoretical and empirical discrepancies from the perspective of foreign tourists' happiness. On the one hand, foreign tourists who come to Bali, the main goal is of course to achieve happiness through traveling. However, it turns out that there are unscrupulous foreign tourists who actually do actions that are not in accordance with the goal of happiness. For example, there are foreign tourists who commit criminal acts and misbehave while traveling in Bali. Firstly, the proof can be seen from a foreign tourist who came from Italy slept in the storefront located in Gang Benesari Kuta (Bali Post, 2020). Secondly, a foreign tourist named JJYC, a Danish citizen, set up a tent in the Kuta beach area (Kumparan.com, 2020). Third, Tribun-travel.com (2019) also noted a number of deviant foreign tourists' behaviors and became viral in the media, such as: foreign tourists fighting in Crystal Bay, Nusa Penida Klungkung, an Australian foreign tourist carrying out a mugging in Canggu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having gap between the expectations of foreign tourists' happiness which is contradictory to the case of foreign tourists in Bali as described above, therefore, it is important to explore more deeply about what and how the real happiness of foreign tourists while traveling in Bali. This study specifically, examined the happiness of foreign tourists from the aspect of the eu-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">daimonic happiness of tourists in Bali, which consists of: (a) how is the influence of the eudaimonic value on product services in Bali. (b) how is the effect of the eudaimonic value on tourist satisfaction in Bali (c) how is the effect of the eudaimonic value on the satisfaction of foreign tourists in Bali, and (d) how is the effect of tourist satisfaction on tourist psychology well being.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Research Objectives</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There are two objectives in this research, general and specific objectives. The general objective is to gain new knowledge about the happiness of foreign tourists who travel to Bali, in particular from the perspective of eudaimonic happiness. Meanwhile, the specific objectives of this study are (a) to prove the effect of the eudaimonic value on the service product in Bali. (b) to prove the effect of eudaimonic values on tourist satisfaction in Bali (c) to prove the effect of the service product on the satisfaction of foreign tourists in Bali, and (d) to prove the effect of tourist satisfaction on tourist psychology well being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LITERATURE REVIEW</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Eudaimonic</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Initially, eudaimonic was introduced by Aristotle who clearly revealed the great ideas of Socrates and Plato which stated that the greatest good in life is eudaimonic which includes happiness, pleasure, and virtue (Bauer et al, 2008). Furthermore, according to Ryan &amp;&nbsp;Deci (2001) eudaimonic is a reformulation of Aristotle's great thought which is related to pleasure and psychosocial meaning in the form of emotions, motivation, personal development and individual relationships with others. Bauer et al. (2008) again added his opinion that eudaimonic happiness is often equated with the mean-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ing of a good life. Eudaimonic is defined as the full and complete achievement of one's potential in one's involvement in an activity that is inherently meaningful and meaningful. Steger et al. (2008). Eudai-monic behavior has a stronger relationship to a person's well-being. This eudaimonic behavior is correlated with one's wellbeing (happiness) (Steger et al., 2008); Steger et al. (2008). Meanwhile, according to Huta &amp;&nbsp;Waterman (2014), simply eu-daimonic has dimensions including: growth, meaning, authenticity, excellence. Furthermore, Steger et al. (2008) again stated that eudaimonic behavior includes those who volunteer (volunteer), make donations, write future goals, express gratitude both orally and in writing, listen carefully to other people's points of view, believe in others, persevere to achieve worthy goals even when they encounter obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ryff (1995) stated that this eudai-monic limit is being equivalent to the theory of psychology well being (PWB). Ryff (1995) introduced the PWB theory which consists of six dimensions of psychological happiness, namely self-acceptance, positive relationships with other people, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and personal growth. Ryff's PBW theory is the result of conceptual references from various sources and researchers. For example, Ryff (1995) referred to Maslo's findings about selfactualization. Erikson found the model &quot;Erikson's model of the stages of psychosocial development&quot;. Erikson in his research discussed a lot about personal development. Furthermore, referring to the findings of Buhler who was able to formulate basic life tendencies, Roger discovered about a fully functioning person, Jung discussed specifically and comprehensively about individuation, and Jahoda found the formulation of positive criteria of mental health, and other expert findings (Ryff, 1995).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The search for eudaimonic measurements in tourism contests is relatively complex. This is in line with the thinking of Huta &amp;&nbsp;Waterman (2014) which states that eudaimonic is a very complex idea. To anticipate so as not to cause confusion in the interpretations of Huta &amp;&nbsp;Waterman (2014) and bias in the presentation of data and results, research on eudai-monic tourist happiness in tourism should adopt a concept known as non-hedonic. Furthermore, according to Lee &amp;&nbsp;Jeong (2019), the limitations of eudaimonic variables in the tourist experience are summarized into 4 aspects, including (1) meaning, (2) self-connectedness, (3) a feeling of accomplishment, and (4) personal expressiveness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>The Service Product</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Experts have revealed many reviews about service products, one of which is (Rust &amp;&nbsp;Oliver, 1994). He relates there is a relationship between product service and service quality. According to (Rust &amp;&nbsp;Oliver, 1994) states that in service quality there are three dimensions, one of which is product service, while the other two are service delivery and service environment. In detail, service products are services designed by service providers by packaging in such a way that the service becomes attractive in the eyes of customers (Rust &amp;&nbsp;Oliver, 1994). This service product concerns product specifications and service targets. In product service of a business, managerial role is so important in introducing service products which are usually equipped with attractive features and easily recognized by customers. In addition, service design is directed at the interests and expectations of consumers. This is obtained from an experimental effort to find out which services are considered the most important by consumers. Rust &amp;&nbsp;Oliver (1994) added that good product service also requires</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the implementation of Quality function deployment (QFD) and Hauser &amp;&nbsp;Clausing, 1988 through the implementation of service quality functions. The application of QFD is very important because the variety of service products and creativity in combining service attributes will be easy to obtain. QFD has particular benefits in designing new service products which are generally done by combining conservative products with extensive service efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the reviews of the service products above are related to tourism, tourism actually also requires a variety of service products that are attractive to tourists. In his article Smith (1994) stated that the service products associated with tourism, entitled the tourism product. According to Kotler (1984) in his article Smith (1994) stated that, explicitly tourism products are not only physical objects but also part of services, staff, places, organizations and ideas. Likewise, the findings of Medic and Middleton (1973) in their article Smith (1994) stated that tourism products are a cycle of activities, services, and benefits that constitute the overall tourist experience. Furthermore, the components to measure it are tourist attractions, destination facilities, accessibility, image and price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another view according to the theory of Jefferson and Lickorish (1988) in Smith (1994), provides another argument regarding the components of tourism products related to services. Jefferson and Lickorish (1988: 59) in Smith (1994) mentioned that tourism products are a combination of physical and services that are expected to meet the wants and needs of buyers. In short, tourism products are activities that satisfy buyers according to the destination they choose (Jefferson and Lickorish, 1988: 211). A different approach was stated by Sasser, Olson, and Wyckoff (1978) in Smith (1994) regarding service product</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">modeling, he said that service products consist of three components, they are facilitating goods, explicit intangibles, and implicit intangibles. Furthermore, Sasser, Olson, and Wyckoff (1978) provided illustrations of this view, for example facilitating goods in a restaurant are the food, explicit intangibles are nutrients or added value in the food, and implicit intangibles are related to service, socialization, atmosphere and relaxation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Tourist Satisfaction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The concept of customer satisfaction has been introduced long ago by Adam Smith in the 18th century which coincided with the era of free market trade (Nigel Hill et al., 2007). According to Fernández-Ballesteros et al. (2001) a person's satisfaction has relevance to health, work, family and travel. Furthermore, in terms of scientific research on customer satisfaction, USA researchers were first conducted on the topic of “customer satisfaction index” (Churchill Jr &amp;&nbsp;Sur-prenant, 1982; Gerson, 1993; N. Hill, 1996; Vavra, 1997). This study uses the method of measuring tourist satisfaction and tourist dissatisfaction. The conception of tourist satisfaction is considered the basis of marketing that focuses on customer needs. In simple terms, the purpose of marketing is to achieve long-term tourist satisfaction which has the main function, namely to attract and maintain tourist satisfaction (Drucker, 1999). A similar opinion was conveyed by Fahy &amp;&nbsp;Jobber (2006) which stated that all forms of business activity were focused on tourist satisfaction orientation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tourist satisfaction is the result of the relationship between experiences and expectations held by tourists when visiting tourist destinations (Pizam et al., 1978). Tourists will feel satisfied when the whole experience can meet the expectation result. Conversely, tourists will feel</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">dissatisfied when the experience is unpleasant or not in line with expectations when traveling (displeasure) (Pizam et al., 1978). Oliver (1997) defines that tourist satisfaction is a tourist's assessment of the product or service purchased to fulfill his pleasure. This assessment is also related to the fulfillment of tourist pleasure, both in excess and in deficiency. Pizam et al. (1978) again added that the definition of tourist satisfaction is a collection of behaviors and experiences obtained by tourists when carrying out tourist activities. Furthermore, McDowall (2010) defines tourist satisfaction as an important concept in understanding the performance of a tourism business management. If the service attributes provided to tourists can achieve guest satisfaction, there is an opportunity to increase customer or tourist loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tourist satisfaction in services in the tourism industry is determined from the variable level of customer perceived value. While the image moderates tourist satisfaction. Furthermore, the image is influenced by the variables of physical environment quality, product quality and service quality (Ryu et al., 2012). Specifically regarding customer satisfaction, Ryu et al. (2012) suggested that there are three indicators to measure the level of tourist satisfaction, namely experience is satisfied, good mood and enjoy. These three indicators of customer satisfaction are also adopted by Zhong &amp;&nbsp;Moon (2020) which states that tourist satisfaction can be measured from three components, namely a satisfying experience, the choice is the right decision, and purchases made can meet consumer expectations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Model Concept</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The concept of eudaimonic tourist happiness in Bali, was built from several views and concepts of the researchers above, namely first, eudaimonic value using the concept approach of Bauer et al,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(2008), Ryan &amp;&nbsp;Deci (2001), Huta &amp;&nbsp;Waterman (2014), Ryff (1995). Then for the services product using the concept (Rust &amp;&nbsp;Oliver, 1994), Smith (1994), Kotler in Smith (1994), Medic and Middleton in Smith (1994) Jefferson and Lickorish Smith (1994). Then tourist satisfaction uses the view expressed by Ryu et al. (2012), Zhong &amp;&nbsp;Moon (2020), Isen et al. (1978), Layard (2002), (Swinyard, 1993), and (Sherman et al., 1997). Then, psychology of tourist well-beeing uses the theory of Pearce (2009), Smith &amp;&nbsp;Diek-mann (2017), and Lee &amp;&nbsp;Jeong (2019). Of the four concepts, which are used as a reference for constructing and developing hypotheses regarding the eudaimonic happiness of foreign tourists visiting Bali, this study is divided into 4 hypotheses, namely:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">H1: The eudaimonic value has a positive and significant effect on product services</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">H2: The eudaimonic value has a positive and significant effect on tourist satisfaction</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">H3: Product service has a positive effect on tourist satisfaction</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">H4: Tourist satisfaction has a positive effect on the psychological happiness of tourists.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/82543-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:209pt;height:151pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This research took place in Bali. While the research subjects are foreign tourists who travel to Bali. The number of samples is 171 respondents. The sample is considered to meet the requirements as stated by Hair et al (2006). SEM analysis research requires samples between 100 to 200 samples Hair et al (2006). The method of analysis in this study is to utilize the use of SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) analysis. According to (Hair et al; 2014) SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) is a method that compiles two elements, namely factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. Furthermore, in compiling a model for the eudaimonic happiness of foreign tourists in Bali, which is tested from product service variables, tourist satisfaction, and psychological happiness of foreign tourists using SEM analysis, it is supported by utilizing the SPSS (Statistical Product and Service Solution) version 25 for windows and AMOS programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULT AND DISCUSSION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Result</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Respondent Characteristic</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the results of distributing questionnaires to 171 foreign tourists who traveled to Bali, it was found that the characteristics of foreign tourists based on continental origin were varied. Foreign tourists from Europe are in the first position, namely (61 tourists/ 35.67%). In the second position are foreign tourists from Australia (45 tourists/26.32%). Next in order are foreign tourists from America (33 tour-ists/ 19.30%), Asia (30 tourists/17.54%) and the lowest is foreign tourists from Africa (2 tourists/1.17%). Based on these results, this indicates that the main market for tourism in Bali is mainly from the aspect of choosing a tourism destination for the search for eudaimonic happiness for</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">foreign tourists in Bali, based on these respondents, tourists who come from Europe and Australia. Furthermore, based on official records issued by the government, foreign tourists from Europe and Australia are always in the top five positions in the Bali tourism market. The dominance of European and Australian tourists in choosing eudaimonic tours, to achieve happiness during foreign tourists traveling in Bali. In line with the existence of Bali tourism destinations, which do highlight the image of cultural tourism destinations. This cultural tourism has long been used as a favorites product of tourism in Bali. The proof is that every element of Balinese culture, from art, religious activities, way of life, technology, communities systems (such as agriculture with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">subak</span><span class="font4"> irrigation) has long been used as part of strengthening the existence of tourist attractions in Bali. These parts, all of them become the main attraction for tourists, so that Bali tourism can be popular in the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Foreign Tourists Response in Bali</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the results of the distribution of questionnaires circulated to respondents (tourists), it was found that the level of eudaimonic happiness of foreign tourists when traveling to Bali obtained an average value of (4.16). Which means, the overall eudaimonic happiness of foreign tourists feels happy traveling to Bali. Of the four variables, namely eudaimonic value, namely the product service, tourist satisfaction, and psychology of tourist well-being, it turns out that the dominant value is included in the category of tourists who feel happy traveling in Bali. Furthermore, if you look at all the indicators, there is even one indicator that gets very happy, namely the indicator that foreign tourists feel happy and enjoy when traveling in Bali (4.25). In addition, specifically for the tourist satisfaction variable, which</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">consists of indicators of tourism services, expectations and accuracy in choosing all of them are also in the very satisfied category. The responses of foreign tourists related to eudaimonic happiness in Bali above, in detail from all variables and all indicators can be described as follows: First, the average value of the variable eu-daimonic value (EUDA) is (4,10) including the happy category, which includes the relationship between good (EUDA1) includes happy category (3.93), Respect and respect for others (EUDA2) happy category (4.23), gratitude Open-minded EUDA 4 happy category (4.20), and EUDA5 also includes happy category (4.15). Second, the average value of the product service (TE) variable is almost similar to the category in the eudaimonic value, which is 4.045 including the good or happy category for foreign tourists. The details of the indicator values are feeling happy with all services (SP1) including happy category (4.05) and happy with the availability and variety of tourism products (SP2) also including happy category for foreign tourists (4.04). Third, the tourist satisfaction variable obtained the highest average rating among all the variables and indicators in this study.

This means that the model being tested is appropriate and appropriate so that the next test can be carried out, namely hypothesis testing. In detail, of the nine types of measurements, all values are good. This means that the formulated model has data indications that are consistent with the theory compiled in the hypothetic model.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The next step in researching the psychological happiness of foreign tourists traveling to Bali is to test the hypothesis. Hypothesis testing is a provisional guess or prediction based on relevant research theory. In testing this hypothesis, there is also a value provision that must be met, namely the CR value &gt;&nbsp;1.96, and the p value &lt;&nbsp;0.05, then the hypothesis can be accepted as positive and significant. Based on the results of hypothesis testing, it turns out that all relationships between variables are positive and significant. The results of hypothesis testing are as follows, (a) (H1) the relationship between Eudaimonic Value and The Service Product is positive and significant with a perfect estimate value of 1,000. (b) (H2) the relationship between Eudaimonic Value and Tourist Satisfaction is also</span></p>

(d) (H4) the relationship between Tourist Satisfaction and Psychology Tourist Wellbeing is positive and significant, namely CR 10,658 &gt;&nbsp;1.96 and P 0.000 &lt;&nbsp;0.05.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the results of the hypothesis above, it turns out that if you look closely, the order of estimate or CR values from the highest to the lowest is (1) the relationship between Tourist Satisfaction and Psychology Tourist Well-being is positive, (2) the relationship between The Service Product and Tourist Satisfaction, (3) the relationship between Eudaimonic Value and The Service Product, and (4) the relationship between Eudaimonic Value and Tourist Satisfaction. This means that, if the eudaimonic value of a foreign tourist is increased, the product service and tourist satisfaction will also increase. Likewise, customer satisfaction will be able to increase if product services are also improved. The psychological happiness of tourists will also increase when the eudai-monic value, product service and tourist satisfaction are also increased. For the case of Bali with this result, in order to achieve the happiness of foreign tourists in Bali in enjoying tourism services and activities in Bali.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">So the orientation of tourism actors, both directly and indirectly, requires integration between tourism components, so that they understand the edaimonic values of foreign tourists in Bali, so that they are able to provide the best tourism services, which will then lead to the achievement of tourist satisfaction when traveling in Bali.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Discussion</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Bali Tourism</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In the midst of the progress of Bali tourism which has been able to achieve brilliant achievements both at the national and international levels. Bali was not always smooth in terms of developing tourism. Bali tourism has faced some worrisome events. For example, in 2002 and 2005 Bali was hit by a humanitarian disaster, namely the Bali bombings due to acts of terrorism. This incident not only shocked the world, but also touched the hearts of the international community who empathize with Bali because this tragedy claimed hundreds of victims from tourists from many countries. As a form of appreciation and respect for the victims of the tragedy, the Balinese government together</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">with all tourism stakeholders built a memorial monument called the Ground Zero Monument, Kuta Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The challenges of Bali tourism doesn't just stop with the tragedy above. Now Bali tourism is again facing tougher challenges due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Bali tourism since March 2020 has decreased drastically. The number of foreign tourists before the Covid-19 Pandemic was crowded, reaching 6.3 million in 2019. Now, tourists visiting Bali have drastically decreased. This condition also has implications for tourism businesses, which are mostly closed. Hundreds of thousands of tourism employs were laid off. Thus, the impact of this Covid Pandemic, which not only has a direct impact on tourism service provides, the impact is also felt very heavily by sectors related to the tourism industry, for example creative businesses, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises MSMEs, agricultural businesses, transportation businesses, and other tourism supporting sectors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the challenges for the existence and sustainability of Bali Tourism at this time due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, one of the important parts in the context of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tourism recovery is the provision of tourism services that are able to provide happiness to foreign tourists. Specifically, the happiness in question is in the form of psychological happiness or eudaimonic tourists. For example, foreign tourists feel happy because they are given the opportunity to enjoy cultural-based tourism villages, learning local culinary, learning traditional dancing, and other cultural tourism activities that can increase the happiness of foreign tourists when traveling in Bali.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Eudaimonic Value dan The Service Product</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Foreign tourists seek their own happiness based on different motivations in Bali. However, specifically in the scope of this research, the foreign tourists in question are discussed only in terms of the psychological happiness (eudaimonic) of foreign tourists. Based on the results of the research presented above, this study found that the eudaimonic happiness of foreign tourists has a close relationship with tourism services in Bali. The illustration is that the better or higher the value of the happiness of tourists, the better and the higher the quality of tourism product services in Bali. This is in line with the findings of Lancaster (1971) in Kusmarini et al. (2020) which states that the perception of value in a business venture can be used to determine performance, products and services including price. The better the customer's perception of value, the easier it will be to determine in terms of service quality and attributes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The value of eudaimonic happiness of foreign tourists is based on psychological values when traveling in Bali, which includes indicators of foreign tourists maintaining good relationships or respect for others, gratitude, clear goals in life, and foreign tourists having an open mind when traveling in Bali. All of these dimensions are considered the most im-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">portant by foreign tourists in Bali. Because the value of eudaimonic happiness will have implications for the type and form of foreign tourists' assessment of the tourist services received by foreign tourists while in Bali. In addition to this, this study also found that foreign tourists were happy with the overall tourism services in Bali. Beside that, they are also happy with the availability of the variety of tourism products in Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The difference in the value of foreign tourists in Bali will determine foreign tourists in choosing tourist services. To be precise, there are foreign tourists who like high-risk types of tourism activities; there are also foreign tourists who like low-risk types. Practically, in Bali there are foreign tourists who like the type of hard adventurer tourism, and there are also those who like the type of soft adventurer tourism. This finding is in line with the opinion expressed by Alvarez &amp;&nbsp;Asugman (2006) which states that the type of planner tourist tends to choose tourism services that are low risk and prefer quality services. This type of tourist is usually favored by female tourists and family tourists. They travel to get psychological happiness and also to gain knowledge of “edu tourism” and new experiences while traveling, especially to increase knowledge for their children who are invited to travel to Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The indicators of tourism services in Bali such as (a) overall tourism services, (b) availability, and (3) diversity of tourism products is an important part chosen by foreign tourists to determine their happiness while in Bali. First, the overall tourism service which are included in the main category and supporting tourism services in Bali. The second, indicators of service availability in Bali are the existence of tourist services is accommodation, restaurants, travel agencies, tourism transportation, tourist attractions and other tourist services. Third, the indicator of the diversity of tourism services in Bali is the variety of tourism services available both </span><span class="font3">e-ISSN 2407-392X. p-ISSN 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in terms of quantitative and qualitative as well as inclusive and exclusive. In general, it can be said that the diversification of tourism services in Bali is relatively good, and has been able to provide happiness to foreign tourists. Based on tourism service phenomenon, which has actually been pursued well by Bali tourism stakeholders, it turns out that this is in line with the thoughts of Rust &amp;&nbsp;Oliver (1994) which states that service products are services designed by service providers. So that the service becomes attractive for the customer (tourist) in order to be able to achieve the satisfaction and happiness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Eudaimonic Value and Tourist Satisfaction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The second finding of this study is that the eudaimonic value of tourists in Bali has a positive and significant influence on tourist satisfaction. The better or higher the value of foreign tourists in Bali, the satisfaction of foreign tourists will be easier to achieve. The main eudaimonic values considered by foreign tourists that determine the satisfaction of foreign tourists in Bali are, (1) good relations or respect for others, (2) gratitude, (3) clear life goals, and (4) having an open mind. These four indicators are factors that foreign tourists feel satisfied traveling in Bali. The indicators of tourist satisfaction that are influenced by the eudaimonic value variable include: a), foreign tourists feel satisfied traveling in Bali, b) the foreign tourists feel satisfied because the expectations of foreign tourists are fulfilled, and c) the foreign tourists are satisfied because they have chosen the right tourist service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The findings above clearly show that the value of eudaimonic is the cause of the satisfaction of foreign tourists in Bali, in fact this is in line with the findings presented by Layard (2002). He stated that a person's happiness is related to tourist satisfaction. Happiness has characteristics, such as: the condition of tourists</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">is in good condition (well being), tourists can enjoy life (quality of life), and tourists have a good view of life. From customer satisfaction, Ryu et al. (2012) suggested, there are three indicators to measure the level of tourist satisfaction, namely experience is satisfied, good mood and enjoy. Then, Zhong &amp;&nbsp;Moon (2020) also stated that, tourist satisfaction can be measured from three components, namely a satisfying experience, the choice made is the right or good decision, and it can fulfilled consumer expectations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>The Service Product dan Tourist Satisfaction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The results of research that prove that tourism product services have an effect on tourist satisfaction have been carried out by many experts. One of them is the research result of Pizam et al. (1978), which said that tourist satisfaction is a collection of behaviors and experiences obtained by tourists when carrying out tourist activities. This study also found the same thing for foreign tourists in Bali. With good tourism product services in Bali, it will also affect the satisfaction of tourists. The higher the service of tourism products in Bali, the higher the tourist satisfaction. In addition to this statement, this finding is also in line with the results of Gong &amp;&nbsp;Yi's (2018) service quality has a positive influence on customer satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The part of tourism product services in Bali that is considered important for increasing tourist satisfaction in Bali is the overall service and availability of product diversity. The better the tourism services and diversification in Bali, the easier it is to achieve tourist satisfaction. Especially in terms of achieving expectations, accuracy in choosing services and overall tourist satisfaction with tourism products in Bali. Referring to the importance of the role of tourism product services as a factor causing tourist satis-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">faction in Bali, this is in line with the statement of Medik and Middleton (1973) in their article Smith (1994) which states that tourism products are a cycle of activities, services, and benefits that constitute the overall tourist experience such as tourist attractions, destination facilities, accessibility, image and price. The provision of services and products such as Middleton's opinion (1973) will be the basis for the satisfaction of tourists who are happy traveling in Bali. In the case of Bali, geographically in choosing tourism services, there is a diversity of preferences. There are foreign tourists who choose tourism services such as Ubud, which emphasizes the image of cultural tourism. For example, foreign tourists choose services such as those in Sanur, because they are interested in beach and marine tourism. And similarly, for foreign tourists who prefer MICE tourism services, which tend to be foreign tourists, choose these services in the Nusa Dua area.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Tourist Satisfaction and Positive Psychology of Tourist Well-being</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The fourth finding in this study is that tourist satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on the psychological well-being of foreign tourists in Bali. The psychological happiness variable of foreign tourists consists of indicators including, (a) foreign tourists feel happy with their health and (b) foreign tourists also enjoy traveling in Bali. The findings of tourist satisfaction have an effect on the psychological happiness of foreign tourists, in line with the results of Layard (2002) research which states that happiness has a close relationship with tourist satisfaction. Happiness in the context of a relationship with satisfaction is determined by characteristics such as (a) tourists are in good condition (well being), (b) tourists can enjoy life (quality of life), and (c) tourists have a view that their lives are valuable. Conversely, dissatisfaction is defined as unhappiness such as feeling </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font3">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">bad (bad mood), not as expected, and the emergence of other negative emotions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to the suitability of this study with the results of Layard (2002) as above, this finding is also very clear in its position in terms of strengthening the results of Lee et al. (2017). He explained that tourist happiness is influenced by tourism service satisfaction and tourism experience satisfaction. The intention of tourists to want the happiness of life, they are willing to travel to Bali. Although relatively long distances. In short, foreign tourists will feel happy when they are provided with good tourism services, which furthermore foreign tourists will feel satisfied when traveling in Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The findings of this research by foreign tourists in Bali not only strengthen the two researchers above, it turns out that the results of this study also confirm the findings of Gong &amp;&nbsp;Yi's (2018) research which states that: (a) Overall service quality has a positive influence on customer satisfaction. (b) Customer satisfaction has an effect on customer loyalty, and (c) customer loyalty has a positive effect on customer happiness. Larivière (2008) also said something similar, that from the customer's perspective, a good waiter will not only provides experience and satisfaction to tourists, but they can also increase the feelings of happiness for tourists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Referring to the description of the relationship between the variables above as well as an explanation of the testing of each indicator, this study found a model of eudaimonic foreign tourists' happiness. This model is simply termed the Model of Tourists Eudaiminic Happiness (MTES). MTES is proven to be fit as a model of psychological happiness for foreign tourists visiting Bali Tourism Destinations. MTES consists of variables of tourist happiness, namely: eudaimonic value, the service product, tourist satisfaction, and psychology of tourist well being variables.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Of the four MTES variables, this study also found that, (a) the eudaimonic value had a positive and significant effect on the service product (b) the eudaimonic value had a positive and significant effect on tourist satisfaction, (c) the service product had a positive and significant effect on tourist satisfaction, and (d) tourist satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on the psychology of tourist well-being positively for foreign tourists in Bali.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">pects of eudaimonic value, the service product, tourist satisfaction, and psychology of tourist well-being. The finding in detail finds that, eudaimonic value has an effect on the service product (b) eudai-monic value has an effect on tourist satisfaction, (c) the service product has an effect on tourist satisfaction, and (d) tourist psychology of satisfaction has a positive effect on tourist well-being for foreign tourists. in Bali. In short, the eudaimonic value is a determinant of the high and low psychological happiness of foreign tourists in Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the review of the results and discussion of the above research, the conclusions and recommendations that can be identified in this study are as follows.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The conclusion of this research is the happiness model of eudaimonic tourists in Bali which is acronymized MTES (Model of Tourists Eudaimonic Happiness). MTES covers the happiness of foreign tourists in Bali which consists of as-</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Recommendations</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Psychologically, the happiness of foreign tourists in Bali is determined by the eudaimonic value of tourists, service quality and tourist satisfaction. Therefore, specifically for tourism stakeholders, it is necessary to pay more attention to the application of these variables, so that the happiness of foreign tourists can be achieved easily, and the quality of tourism in Bali can be better realized in the future. The happiness of foreign tourists is not only determined from the eudaimonic side</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">in Bali. There are other variables that determine the happiness of foreign tourists in Bali. Therefore, for future research, it is necessary to adopt other variables as determinants of foreign tourists' happiness, for example social value variables, foreign tourists' family values and cultural values studied in relation to foreign tourists' happiness.</span></p>
