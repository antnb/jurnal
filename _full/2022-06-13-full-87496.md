<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The culture of the Sasak tribe is one of the natural resources owned by the supporting community. One of them is the marriage custom of the Sasak people in the North Lombok Regency. The purpose of the study was to identify the meaning of the traditional lexicon of the Sasak marriage, North Lombok Regency which is focused on lexicon has linguistic meanings aspect (the lexical meanings and the grammatical meanings) and the lexicon has cultural meanings aspect. The descriptive qualitative method was used to dismantle life experiences in order to understand social reality. The data collection methods used observation, listening, interview, and introspection. Data collection techniques were applied tapping technique, fishing, recording, and note-taking. Methods of data analysis utilized were equivalent and distributional methods. The technique of presenting the results of data analysis was undertaken through formal and informal techniques. The results of the study indicate that there are lexicon meanings in the marriage custom of the Sasak People in North Lombok Regency such as the linguistic meanings and the cultural meanings. The linguistic meaning consisted of two meanings, namely lexical meaning to reveal the meaning of the lexicon before it changes shape and the grammatical meaning to reveal the lexicon after undergoing the grammaticalization process such as repetition of words and phrases. While the cultural meanings expressed the form of the implied meaning of each lexicon used in the marriage customs of the North Lombok Regency community as a manifestation of the culture created by the Sasak people.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Language is a cultural resource (Duranti, 1997:2-3). Language is not only ergon (medium or tools) only; Language is the energy (power, power, or strength) that binds together a dense and emotional togetherness because language is also part of the history of the speech people itself (Cassirer, 1987). Language is a social convention, as well as a builder and successor of meaning and value (Barker, 2005). Culture refers to acquired knowledge, which people use to interpret experiences and generate social behavior (Spradley, 1997:5). Culture is a very complex set of daily life experiences including history, social structure, religion, tradition, customs, and language (Threveni, 2002: 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Sasak people have three marriage systems that are commonly used, namely tepedait or (dijodohkan) arranged marriages, marriage proposals or melakoq, and mamulang, or carrying away. Tepedait marriage system or arranged marriage is a marriage system that is carried out on the basis of the agreement of the parents of both parties. This marriage system is usually carried out because there is a family relationship with the aim of keeping the lineage maintained and not mixed with people who have low social status. Therefore, this tepadait marriage system is usually carried out by the noble class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The marriage system of lamar or melakoq is a marriage system that requires men to propose to women in front of their parents and family. This marriage system is rarely used because it is considered to have a long and tortuous process. In this marriage system, both partners between a man and a woman have agreed to marry because they love each other. However, when a man proposes to his partner in front of his parents or family, sometimes it is not immediately approved and requires a very long process. Therefore, the proposed marriage system is rarely used by the Sasak people of North Lombok, especially for this reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The most famous marriage system and often used by the Sasak people of North Lombok is mamulang. This mamulang marriage system is not only used by the people of North Lombok, but is also used in general by all the Sasak (SS) tribes on the island of Lombok. Mamulang or paulang can be interpreted as carrying away or stealing a woman who her partner wants to marry. However, it should be noted that this mamulang tradition does not mean stealing a woman by force or without the woman's will, but rather being carried away on the basis of consensual and willpower of the woman on the basis of agreement both of the between the bride and groom. Mamulang or paulang can be interpreted as carrying away or stealing a woman who her partner wants to marry. However, it should be noted that this mamulang tradition does not mean stealing a woman by force or without the woman's will, but rather being carried away on the basis of consensual and willpower of the woman on the basis the basis of agreement both of the between the bride and groom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formulation of Problem</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The observing of the background report above, the problem that becomes the basis of the study in this research is the meaning of the traditional lexicon of marriage for the Sasak people, North Lombok district.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theory</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Lexical meaning and grammatical meaning</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lexical meaning (lexical meaning, semantic meaning, external meaning) is the meaning of language elements as symbols of objects, events, and others. The lexical meaning is owned by the language elements separately, regardless of the context (Harimurti, 1982:103). The example, the word culture, namely culture in the Shadily and Echols dictionaries, is mentioned as a noun (noun) and its meaning; courtesy, culture; (1) maintenance of culture (biology), (2) in the Indonesian language dictionary I (p38), culture is a noun, and the meaning: (1) thoughts;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">common sense, (2) culture, (3) concerning culture, which has developed (civilized, advanced). All meanings (both basic and derived forms) that exist in the dictionary are called lexical meanings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These words have meaning and can be read in a dictionary. Such meaning is also called dictionary meaning, in addition to lexical meaning (dictionary meaning). There are also those who say that lexical meaning is the meaning of words when they stand alone, both in their derivative form and in their basic form. The lexical meaning of a word is contained in a standalone word. This means that the meaning of a word can change when the word is already in the sentence. Therefore there are words whose lexical meaning can be understood if they have been linked to other words. Such words are including to groups of task words or particles, for example words and, this, to, which.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In general, lexical meaning can be grouped into two major groups, namely basic meaning and extended meaning, or denotative meaning (cognitive, descriptive) and connotative or emotive meaning. The relationship between the word, the meaning of the word, and the world of reality is called a referential relationship. The relationship that exists between; (1) the word as a phonological unit, which carries meaning, (2) the meaning or concept formed by the word, (3) the world of reality that is pointed to (referred to) by the word, is a referential relationship (Djajasudarma, 2012:38). A referential relationship is a relationship that exists between a word and the external world of the language referred to by the speaker, for example:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Dictionary : refers to certain type of book</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thick : refers to a certain quality of an object</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Go : refers to particular activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The relationship between the word (symbol), meaning (concept or reference) and something that is referred to (referent) is an indirect relationship. This relationship is described by the so-called semiotic triangle (see Ogden &amp;&nbsp;Richards, 1972; Palmer, 1996).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Meaning (concept) Thought of Reference</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/87496-3.png" alt="" style="width:277pt;height:64pt;">
<p><span class="font3">Word Referent Symbol stands for referent</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Symbols or symbols are linguistic elements in the form of words (sentences, etc.); referent is an object or thing that is pointed out (events, facts in the world of human experience); the concept (reference) is what we have in mind about the object that is manifested through the symbol (symbol). Based on this theory, the relationship of symbols and referents (reference) through concepts that reside in the brain, the relationship is an indirect relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Grammatical semantics is a semantic study that specifically examines the meaning contained in sentence units. Verhaar (1983:9) states that grammatical semantics is much more difficult to analyze. The sentence is still sitting, brother has been asleep for a long time, is a sentence that is difficult to analyze. People should not interpret in terms of the words that make it up. People have to interpret from the whole content of the sentence, even something behind the sentence. The sentence can be described as follows: there are two friends, say, Bayu and Ahza. Bayu and Ahza visit Delna's house. Bayu still has a family relationship with Delna, therefore Delna's sister greets Bayu, brother. It seems that Ahza is still a stranger at Delna's house, while Bayu, because of his family relationship, is somewhat free. At 12.15 Bayu immediately ate</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">without inviting Ahza. After eating because he was sleepy, Bayu immediately went to sleep. Ahza didn't know this. Apparently Ahza enjoys reading magazines. That fact saw by Adil Delna, then she said to Ahza, &quot;Still sitting, a brother has been sleeping for a long time&quot;. Based on the narration, people will understand or be able to interpret the meaning of the sentence, still sitting, you have been sleeping for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Grammatical meaning, or functional meaning, or structural meaning, or internal meaning are meanings that arise as a result of the functioning of words in sentences (Pateda, 2010:103). In semantics, grammatical meaning is distinguished from lexical meaning. In line with the understanding of meaning (sense), meaning is different from meaning (meaning). Meaning is the link that exists between language units, can be connected with grammatical meaning, while meaning is the understanding of word units as elements that are connected.</span></p>

Data collection methods used are; observation method, watch method, interview method, and introspection method. The using of data collection techniques; tapping technique, fishing technique, recording technique, and note-taking technique. Methods of data analysis using the equivalent method and distributional method. The technique of presenting the results of data analysis uses formal and informal techniques.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning culture</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The cultural meaning referred to in this study is the meaning contained in the culture itself, namely the marriage customs of the KLU people. The series of traditional marriage processes contain various meanings that represent the way the KLU people views the environment and the life in it. Based on the data that has been presented, it can be said that the cultural meanings contained in the marriage customs of the Sasak KLU people are in the form of religious, social, and moral values. The lexicon contained in the marriage customs of the KLU people shows that social meaning is more emphasized in the implementation of the marriage process. The social meaning in question is cooperation, mutual assistance, and a sense of togetherness. This can be</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">found in the lexicon in the form of verbs, such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sorong serah, nyongkolan, begawe, tanjak taring,</span><span class="font3"> and others. To better understand the social meanings contained in the marriage customs of the KLU people, the following explains the meaning of the lexicon that can represent the social meaning referred to in this research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First, sorong serah is the core event of the KLU people marriage system. The event of this sorong serah, it will be seen that their solidarity is very high. This is evidenced by their participation in the sorong serah event even though they were not invited, even the people were very enthusiastic when they heard that one of the residents was getting married. The event of sorong serah, the people followed all the provisions that were put in place without feeling burdened. For example, those who will carry out the handover will wear full traditional clothes, be polite, and say politely and don't offend others. Thus it can be concluded that the people upholds a sense of togetherness and intimacy as well as a sense of mutual respect between each other. The event of this sorong serah, the people followed all the provisions that were put in place without feeling burdened. For example, those who will carry out the sorong serah will wear full traditional clothes, be polite, and say politely and don't offend others. Thus it can be concluded that the people upholds a sense of togetherness and intimacy as well as a sense of mutual respect between each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Second, nyongkolan is a well-known tradition of the SS people not only in KLU, but also in the SS people on the island of Lombok. In this nyongkolan activity, the people also rejoiced in welcoming him and participating in the nyongkolan event. In this case, they are also required to obey the rules contained in these activities. Those who follow this nyongkolan process must wear traditional clothes complete with all the attributes. This reflects that the people has a high sense of togetherness and responsibility in order to uphold a tradition. In addition, the people also helps the family of the bride and groom by participating in the event even though they have to endure the heat and fatigue of walking with the bride and groom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Third, begawe is a tradition of the SS people in KLU which aims to show gratitude to the Almighty Creator. The begawe event is realized by inviting relatives and the surrounding people to come to eat. In this event, it was found that the people uphold a sense of togetherness, cooperates, and helps each other. With their own awareness, the people, especially the neighbors of the people who had the gawe event, came to help for the smooth running of the begawe event. They help voluntarily without expecting anything in return from the party who organized the show. They work together in everything needed in the begawe event, such as working together in cooking, some are in charge of welcoming guests, washing dishes, and so on. This is indicates that the KLU people has a high sense of togetherness and kinship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fourth, tanjak taring is the activity of installing fangs or roofs on the bride's house in preparation for carrying out the begawe event. In this activity, young people or parents come to the bride's house with their own awareness. They work together and help each other in installing the fangs. They volunteered in the hope that in the future they would be helped as they had done. In this activity, the host also appreciated the services of the people who had helped him make fangs by giving coffee and cigarettes to the fang maker. This means that the material is not a measure in the KLU people, but rather prioritizes togetherness and mutual cooperation.</span></p>
