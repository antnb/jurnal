<p><span class="font1">This article is designed to explore the problem of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rapingn</span><span class="font1"> crops encoded in the form of words, phrases, sentences and even discourse. This scientific study raised several issues, such as How do people manage </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> plant as one of the supporting community cultural activity? How </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kerapingan</span><span class="font1"> forms of expression are seen as ideas, thoughts, and ideology of the environment in which they live? What are the meanings contained in the expression of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kerapingan</span><span class="font1">? What are the functions of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kerapaingan</span><span class="font1"> expressions relating to the relationship between people and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> plants?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This paper aims to describe the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> crop management, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kerapingan</span><span class="font1"> form of expression, the meaning contained in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kerapingan</span><span class="font1"> expression, and function of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kerapingan </span><span class="font1">expressions. To explain the problems of the study, eco-linguistic framework is used. The principle of eco-linguistic theory is a way of managing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> crop diversity to create a mutually dependent relationship between the public and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> plants, insects, and other plants.

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1. Introduction</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">The life of Manggarai community group is very dependent on palm trees in Manggarai language called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1">. One of the tribes in Manggarai cultivates this plan ttraditionally. The community is Kolang tribe who live in west Manggarai. They consider that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> is plant of life because it grows arround the human settlements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As stated earlier that the community of Kolang cultivate the plant in a way that is inherited by their ancestors.The plants are treated to a variety of public interests, such as the construction of the house.The fibers </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wing</span><span class="font1"> of plant or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lebe wunut</span><span class="font1"> are processed for the roof of houses, especially traditional custom house called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mbaru wunut</span><span class="font1">. The leaves are processed into the roofs of houses and huts in the fields. The midribs are used to flank wooden fence or in the yard and in the fields, its fibers are made for fastening fence, and the fruit stems are easily processed to get juice or mince 'sweet drinks' and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tuak</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cultural activities mentioned above are encoded verbally taking the forms of lexicon, phrases, sentences, and even discourse. Lingual signs that describe the environment in which people live are interacting, interrelated, and interdependent. This is in line with the so-called by Sapir that it is the vocabulary of a language that most clearly reflects the physical and social environment of its speakers (Fill, 2001:2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kerapingan</span><span class="font1"> phrase is related to cultivation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> includingverbs, nouns, adjectives, sentences. However,t his article merely presents some verbs, nouns, andadjectives. First, the verbcan describe raping processing activities. In the treatment process there are some verbs such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tekang</span><span class="font1"> 'puncture', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">irih</span><span class="font1"> 'cut', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">landu</span><span class="font1"> 'seduce</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">' tong '</span><span class="font1">catch up', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tuke</span><span class="font1"> 'ascend', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">caling '</span><span class="font1">replace'. Secondly, some adjectives that describe the quality of processed products, such as beverages, sugar and the nature of raping stems and fruits. The 41</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">products include </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mince</span><span class="font1"> 'sweet juice', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">metel</span><span class="font1"> 'strong', pait 'sour', bakok 'white'. Properties of plant stem are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cirang</span><span class="font1"> 'hard', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ngoel</span><span class="font1">'flabby', harat 'sharp', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">miteng '</span><span class="font1">black’ and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">benge '</span><span class="font1">fragrant'.The third is a noun. This category includes two groups: noun group and noun phrase. Groups ofnoun: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> 'palm tree', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wunut</span><span class="font1"> 'fibers', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ndara</span><span class="font1"> 'fruit ladden', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">longko</span><span class="font1"> 'fruit', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leka</span><span class="font1"> 'pelepah', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">saung</span><span class="font1"> 'leaves', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lombong</span><span class="font1"> 'shoots'.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Raping</span><span class="font1"> or palm is a tree that can live and grow in the highlands about 800m2 above sea level. This plant has the advantage, that the roots are very strong to keep the density of the soil so that the soil is protected from erotion or landslides. These plants usually live in the watershed and slope of 40 degrees. Raping is very useful for human life, especially for Kolang ethnic in Manggarai. In general,the palm tree has a multi-purpose, among others, for house materials, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wunut</span><span class="font1"> 'fibers'. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wunut</span><span class="font1"> is used for the roof of the house, especially the traditional house. From those words, a compound is created, that is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mbaru wunut </span><span class="font1">'thatched roofed house', the same </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wunut</span><span class="font1"> is spun into </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wase</span><span class="font1"> 'rope' to tie </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kaba</span><span class="font1"> 'buffalo', </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jarang </span><span class="font1">'horse' and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kena</span><span class="font1"> 'fence'. The leaves are used for the roof of the house, the young fruit is tapped as a source of raw materials for making </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">golamalang</span><span class="font1"> 'sugar cube'. In short </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> tree is very useful for humans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This tree grows naturally. People cultivate it for years for the benefit of human beings. Currently </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> tree is getting less in number. There are no slightest efforts to replant new trees to replace trees that have died though the trees reveal meanings, such as social, economic, and cultural meanings and multi-purpose for human life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A number of studies have concluded these plants are multipurpose. Professor of Biology, University of Padjadjaran Bandung, Johan Iskandar (Kompas on Saturday 30 April 2011:16) states that palm trees are protector and balance the ecosystems and the countryside ecology. Its roots are very solid, deep, and spread out so it has an important function for</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">preventing soil erosion. In addition, the roots also serve to store water, so that the palm tree can grow in arid areas. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nira</span><span class="font1"> ‘juice’ is used as an ingredient in traditional medicines, for example constipation, mouth sores, pneumonia, dysentery, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reality shows that from the beginning until now no attempt of reforestation or replanting new trees to replace trees that have been destroyed and trees were cut for other purposes. In 1970-1971 Manggarai was stricken by starvation. Therefore, many raping trees are cut to take </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">owak</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kuwang</span><span class="font1">, to be used as food. Since then, the population of raping has decreased until today. Symptoms of extinction of this tree, becomes a symptom of extinction of languages and cultures. From the perspective of ecolinguistics, raping population extinction symptoms brought the extinction of languages and cultures. It was a concern of ecolinguists and ecologist, and cultural linguists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to being a useful tree economically and culturally, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> is also beneficial to the stability of the soil on slopes and river banks, preventing erosion or landslides due to prolonged rain or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">during</span><span class="font1"> 'rain do not stopf or seven days and seven nights'. Due to its great benefits, the tree should be preserved in order to preserve the ecosystem and ecology of the country side where the palms grow. If the trees grow and the population is increasing, then there is a harmonious relationship between man and the nature surroundings or environment. In other words, to keep the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> tree is just the same as preserving culture, including the language.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical Framework and Research Method</span><br><br><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical Framework</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Ecolinguistics is a subdescipline of linguistics that is constructed from the collaboration of linguistic theory and ecology. And thus, the basic assumption of ecolinguistic theory refers to three parameters of ecolinguistics proposed by Haugen (1972), namely: diversity, interrelation, interdependance, and environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Language diversity explains the internal relationship between the language diversity such as the lexicon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kerapingan</span><span class="font1"> that creates interdependence lexical relation to produce the diversity of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kerapingan</span><span class="font1"> that finally explains the environment of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kerapingan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fill and Muhlhausler say that the description of linguistic theory must be started from the lexicon (words) which is an instrument recording the events of the physical and social environments. The diversity of vocabulary is due to the interaction of the one lexicon with other the lexicon bearing the diversity of meanings, ideas and ideologies. The lexical diversity also explains the diversity of both physical and social environment. Lexical process</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">is in fact a process of forming a new lexicon, in which interconnected and intertwined interdependence of new lexicon functions as a reflection of the natural environment, both biotic and abiotic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to a variety of lexicon there is also a variety of text and discourse about the environment, for example, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> 'palm'. Raping is viewed as a tree representing a source of livelihood of people and a multipurpose tree. Therefore, the tree has a metaphor, discourse, tales. Those lingual forms serve to explain the relationship between humans and nature and the language and nature. In addition, the lingual forms have meaning, ideas, and ideology of the speakers of the ecological language. Haugen, 1972 (see Fill and Muhlhausler, 2001: 4) defined language ecology is a study on the interaction of the existing language with the environment. In this case the environment in question is the people who use a language as a code more important than a reference world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The data that have been collected in the course of a study could be classified into two types, namely oral and written data. The oral data were obtained through interviews. The oral data are the informants responses that were narrated in the form lexicon of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kerapingan</span><span class="font1">, statements relating to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> tree processing, such as how to tap palm wine. Oral data is often called primary data. In addition to written data obtained through observation, observation notes, for example, a record of the time of processing, the materials for</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">processing, and the means used during the processing. Written data is often called secondary data. Thus, the type of research data is of two kinds, namely oral data as the primary data and written data as secondary data.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The method used in this study is a qualitative method. Within the framework of collecting data, two ways are used, namely interviews and observations. The first is the method of interview. Several questions relating to the cultivation of raping, the terms of raping, and plants and insects that depend on the raping tree are prepared. The researcher then approached the groups who cultivate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1">, both in the field, in Kolang, Kuwus district, West Manggarai Regency as well as in Bali, who happened to come on holiday to Bali. The method of interview is also used to collect both cultural and lingual data. It is supported by recording and note taking techniques. Recording and note taking are done with the permission of interviewees (interviewee), in addition to collect data on current / time to undertake activity of raping tree processing to produce a variety of products in addition to their understanding of the meaning of the lexicon, phrase, sentence, text, and discourse of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kerapingan</span><span class="font1"> as a reference value Results of the interview are cross-checked against observational data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second is the method of observation or direct observation. The researcher takes part in it along with the people who manage the raping. The researcher observed the direct 46</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">processing of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> up to enjoy the products, such as palm wine or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mince</span><span class="font1"> and sugar sweet or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gola malang.</span><span class="font1"> The technique used in this data collection is participant observation. Garna (1999: 67) argues that participant observation is applied in a way that the researcher observes the social activities in which the researcher himself is a member, or consider himself as part of society that feel things as perceived by the groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Observation participation was implemented through the strategy, namely (1) passive participation, researcher did not interfere in the activity of processing (did not have a specific role, although he was present in the speech events); The main techniques of this method is recording technique. The process of making </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gola</span><span class="font1"> 'sugar' and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sopi</span><span class="font1"> 'alcoholic beverages' presented by the speakers were recorded on cassette tape, then transcribed. Transcription is done in two languages; Manggarai and Indonesian languages, along with a wide range of information relating to nonverbal activities, for example: how to sit while tapping </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nira</span><span class="font1">, gestures, and a variety of supporting devices to make gola 'sugar cube.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>4.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technique of Collecting Data</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">At the time of interview the researcher noted and recorded using a camera and handycamp. Note taking are often incomplete. Therefore, it is necessary to have a record from camera and handycamp. Recordings are played back and recorded accurately. This activity is referred to as transcribing the recorded data. Data transcript was compared with a record of the interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the time of observation, the researcher and assistants observed and took notes on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raping</span><span class="font1"> processing activities. The record result was revised repeatedly until no lost of information</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">meanings, and functions of the lexicon, the relationship between the lexicons and the loss of raping species. The data have been grouped were analyzed by using qualitative methods. This method of analysis is based on naturalistic paradigm proposed by Garna (1999: 59). Accordingly, the interpretation of meaning must be based on the socio-cultural context of Manggarai ethnic communities, especially farmer groups that manage raping. Thus, this study is expected to provide a statement close to the natural conditions of Manggarai ethnic character.</span></p>
