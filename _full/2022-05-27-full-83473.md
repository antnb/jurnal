<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Lasem District is an area located in Rembang Regency, Central Java Province. Lasem sub-district consists of a number of villages, namely Karasgede, Jolotundo, Sumbergirang, Karangturi, Babagan, Dorokandang, Gedongmulyo, Dasun, Soditan, Ngemplak, Selopuro, Sendangcoyo, Ngargomulyo, Kajar, Gowak, Sendangasri, Tasiksono, Sriombo, Bonang, and Binangun. Lasem District has various kinds of resources including natural, city, human, cultural,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and so on. One of the prominent resources is archaeological resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Archeological resources are resources that include objects, sites, and areas. Archeological resources are also known as cultural resources. According to John Carman, cultural resources consist of three components, namely objects, sites, and areas. Objects or remains consist of artifacts and monumental buildings; a site is a place that contains objects; whereas a landscape includes the natural, cultural,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and social landscapes surrounding the site (Carman, 2001).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lasem has archeological resources scattered in several villages and one of the villages that has quite a lot of archeological resources is Karangturi Village. The archeological resource is the old town area. The old town is an area that is divided into several areas such as residential areas, economy, culture, and cultural heritage buildings. Archeological resources in Karangturi Village have potential in the economic, cultural, and social environment sectors. In this sector, good management is needed with the aim that these sectors can support one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Based on this explanation, the formulation of the problem in this research is what archeological resources are in Karangturi Village and how to manage archeological resources in Karangturi Village through the approach of Heritage Urban Landscape. Based on the formulation of the problem, the purpose of this study is to determine the structured and systematic management of archeological resources in urban areas, especially in Karangturi Village, Lasem District, Rembang Regency.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>METHOD AND THEORY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The location of this research is in Karangturi Village, Lasem District, Rembang Regency, Central Java. The research method that the author uses is a qualitative method using data collection methods such as observation and literature study. The data analysis method used is the Heritage Urban Landscape (HUL) approach using 7 HUL approaches. The seven steps of the HUL approach are (1) reviewing urban, natural, cultural, and human resources; (2) reviewing participatory planning, stakeholders, and conservation action targets; (3) analyzing cultural heritage vulnerability in the social, economic, and climate fields; (4) integrating the value of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">urban cultural heritage with the status of vulnerability into the urban development framework; (5) prioritizing policies, conservation and development actions as well as public services; (6) defining stakeholders with a management framework; and (7) develop coordination mechanisms and activities between stakeholders (Brahmantara, 2020:63-64; Member State of UNESCO World Heritage Center,2019:5). Besides that, the author also uses the Five Elements City Image analysis method as a supporting analysis for the Heritage Urban Landscape method. Analysis of the Five Elements of City Image consists of paths, nodes, edges, districts, and landmarks (Lynch, 1960:46-48). This analysis is used to provide an overview of the city's resources. The results of data analysis are presented in a descriptive form.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">“</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature, and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity (UNESCO, 2003)</span><span class="font6">”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Oral traditions and expressions, which include language, performing arts, social practices, rituals and celebratory events, knowledge, and practices about nature and the universe, and traditional handicrafts, are included in UNESCO's classification of intangible heritage. Tangible cultural heritage is something that can be perceptible, touchable, or physical artifacts. Physical artifacts or artifacts important to archeology, architecture, or science are examples of tangible cultural heritage (UNESCO, 2003; UNESCO, 2003b).</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Chinese-Indies style residential building is a building that combines a typical Chinese architectural style with European architectural elements. Elements of Chinese architecture are usually clearly visible on the gable roof, with a pointed tip on the ridge. On the other hand, elements of European architecture can be seen in the use of large pillars at the front of the house (Riyanto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">, 2020:61).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Indies-style residential building is a type of house built with the dominance of European architectural style, but with some adjustments to tropical conditions in Indonesia. The hallmark of the Indies house is the use of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">columns to support the house which was deliberately built high enough to maximize air circulation. In addition, Indies houses are usually decorated with large windows. Another characteristic is the use of arches in architecture. The roof</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">that is widely used in Indies houses is the pyramid roof (Riyanto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">, 2020:61).</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/83473-9.jpg" alt="" style="width:175pt;height:117pt;">

<p><span class="font6">The Chinese-Javanese style residential building is a building that combines Chinese and traditional Javanese architecture. The characteristics of the building in the Chinese-Javanese style are the mixing of architectural styles in the house seen in the main building of the house, while the front is a door leaf decorated with Chinese characters.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Review of Participatory Planning, Stakeholders, and Targets Preservation Actions</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Karangturi village is known as a village of religious tolerance. The existence of harmony between ethnicities, cultures, and religions makes participatory planning very effectively implemented in this village. Participatory planning is an approach that provides opportunities for the community to be directly or indirectly involved in the decision-making process. Participatory planning has the goal of deciding to advance and develop something to be achieved. The parties involved in participatory planning are all elements of society (Abe, 2002; Purwandari, 2018: 91).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The existence of the community is very necessary for determining targets and conservation actions in Karangturi Village. Not only the community but other stakeholders also play a role in carrying out conservation actions. In general, the intended target is to manage, develop, and preserve in areas that have archeological resources in Karangturi Village. The parties involved in participatory planning can be classified into three groups, namely groups of government agencies, community or community organizations, and the people. The following is a description of the parties that act as participatory planning in determining conservation targets and actions in Karangturi Village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Government Agencies</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The existence of government agencies as stakeholders is very important. Government agencies serve as a forum for developing, managing, and preserving archeological resources for community organizations or communities and the general public in Karangturi Village. The following are stakeholders from government agencies as well as the fields of activity and tasks they cover</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">which will be presented in the form of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">table 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Community Organizations</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The existence of community organizations plays a role in bridging government agencies with the general public. The existence of community organizations is also a forum to develop the quality and quantity of society. In general, the goals of each community organization are by the vision and mission as well as the field of activity. In Karangturi Village and Lasem Subdistrict, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;community</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">organizations can be involved in participatory planning. The following is data related to community organizations and the fields of activity they cover:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">hence they can promote the programs, especially related to educational tourism and marketing strategies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people are the most basic and most important element in carrying out participatory planning. The existence of the people can provide criticism and suggestions in developing the management and preservation of archaeological resources. The existence of the people can also fill positions in community organizations and government agencies. In this writing, the people involved in participatory planning are classified into two categories, namely the general public and local communities. Local communities are people who live</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">in Karangturi Village, while the general public is immigrants, domestic and foreign tourists, local entrepreneurs, and people throughout Indonesia. Local communities have the task of managing and developing the city's internals. The general public consisting of immigrant communities, domestic or international tourists as well as the Indonesian people are expected to be able to maintain, care for, and introduce archaeological and other resources in Karangturi Village to everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Analysis of Cultural Conservation Vulnerability in the Social, Economy and Climate Sector</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to the Indonesian Dictionary, vulnerability comes from the word &quot;vulnerable&quot; which means sensitive and easy to feel (Departemen Pendidikan Nasional, 2008). Vulnerability in the context of cultural heritage is all impacts that can be given to cultural heritage in various fields including politics, economy, climate, and so on. In this paper, the problem of vulnerability to cultural heritage can be divided into three aspects, namely social, economic, and climate. The following is an explanation of the vulnerability found in Karangturi Village in terms of three aspects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Social Aspect</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the social aspect, the vulnerability found in Karangturi Village is that many young people choose to migrate and are not interested in developing and managing these archaeological resources. The management and development of archaeological resources are managed by elders and people who only have a sensitivity in the fields of history and education. The problem that occurs when young people are less sensitive to education and history is that there are not many educational institutions from elementary schools to high schools in</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Karangturi Village. Based on data from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Badan Pusat Statistik</span><span class="font6"> (BPS) of Rembang Regency (2020:33-49), the number of schools in Karangturi Village is 1 elementary school and 2 senior high schools. The young generation is more interested to have lived out of the city since outer cities give more attractive educational institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Economic Aspects</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the economic aspect, the vulnerability found in Karangturi Village is a very large nominal amount in conserving archeological buildings. Based on the data that has been submitted in point one, the number of archeological resources owned by Karangturi Village is 74 remains. The number of funds needed to conserve the 74 remains of course uses a large number of funds. Archeological remains that are not conserved will have an impact on the condition of the building. In addition, financial problems in conservation, bureaucratic problems in unstructured and systematic conservation make the management and preservation of archeological resources not optimal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Climate Aspects</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to data from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Badan Pusat Statistik</span><span class="font6"> (BPS) of Rembang Regency (2021:3-6), this region has a tropical climate with an average temperature of 23°C and a maximum temperature of 33°C. Areas with a tropical climate have two seasons, namely the dry season and the rainy season. In 2020, rainy days and rainfall are 104 days with 1,771 mm of rainfall. The influence of the tropical climate on cultural heritage buildings has an impact on the form and building materials. Changes in the form and building materials are caused by changes in the weather that occur continuously. If left continuously, cultural heritage buildings will be damaged and it is difficult to carry out conservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Integrating Cultural Heritage Values Cities with Vulnerable Status into City Development Framework</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Undang-Undang No. 11 Tahun 2010</span><span class="font6"> about </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cagar Budaya </span><span class="font6">(Pemerintah Republik Indonesia, 2010), the values possessed by cultural heritage are the values of history, science, education, religion, and culture. Historical value is the value contained in the relationship between the past and the present and has a relationship with the future (Dewi, 201:594). The historical value of Karangturi Village cannot be separated from the history of Lasem's development from time to time. The history of Lasem begins with developments on the northern coast. Over time, various periods from prehistoric, Hindu-Buddhist, Islamic, Colonial to the present day inhabit this region. History also records that Lasem had a relationship with Chinese people who came to the Lasem area (Riyanto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">, 2020:77). The value of knowledge possessed by Karangturi Village is closely related to various fields of science such as archeology, anthropology, and architecture. In the field of archeology, many remains are found in this area and until now still not fully studied. In the field of anthropology, the various tribes, races, and religions that inhabit this region provide knowledge and learning in its culture and traditions. In the field of architecture, many buildings in this area have various forms and types of architecture such as Chinese-style architecture, Indies, Deck, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The educational value found in Karangturi Village is certainly closely related to the values of history, culture, religion, and science. Educational Values can provide information to the entire community regarding the culture found in this region, interactions between communities, and the natural, environmental, and archeological</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">potential of this region. Cultural values that are owned in Karangturi Village include the existence of various ethnicities and cultures. This cultural diversity can be seen from the cultural heritage owned, such as batik, dance, buildings, and so on. In addition, this region has two cultures that are still strong, namely Chinese culture and Islamic culture. The religious value of Karangturi Village in the form of the existence of places of worship such as churches, mosques, and temples, shows that in the past, tolerance between religious communities was highly respected. Until now, the values of tolerance in Karangturi Village are still maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This value of tolerance must be maintained and used as a reference for advancing inter-religious relations in the future. Cultural heritage values found in Karangturi Village certainly cannot be separated from the problems of social, economic, and climate vulnerability. The following is a description of the relationship between values and vulnerability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Historical Value</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Value The historical value of Karangturi Village can be related to two vulnerabilities, namely the social and economic fields. In the social field, it is noted that Karangturi Village is an area that has a fairly long history from the Hindu-Buddhist period to the present. However, problems related to the younger generation who do not like history make this historical value not present in each young generation in Karangturi Village. This is evidenced by the historical record of Lasem in the form of Lasem being a trading center area. However, at this time Karangturi Village and its surroundings are &quot;Dead City&quot; because many people do not know this location and only become a stopover place for people who travel out of town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition, economic problems are caused by unstructured and systematic bureaucracy. This is proven based on historical records in Indonesia, where Indonesia previously had a bad record regarding fund management.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Knowledge Value</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The value of knowledge in Karangturi Village can be related to two vulnerabilities, namely the social and climate fields. In the social field, Karangturi Village has various kinds of knowledge such as architecture, history, archeology, and so on. The existence of social-related problems in the form of young people who don't like regional knowledge in Karangturi Village makes the values of science unable to be spread and distributed to everyone. In the climate sector, climate change causes damage to archeological remains in Karangturi Village. This requires knowledge related to the management and preservation of these archeological remains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Educational Value</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The educational value of Karangturi Village can be related to three vulnerabilities, namely the social, economic, and climate fields. In the social field, the social problems found in Karangturi Village are the lack of sensitivity of the younger generation to develop education in Karangturi Village. This is evidenced by the fact that many young people prefer to live in big cities rather than in Karangturi Village. This problem has an impact on the value of education, namely the decline in education in Karangturi Village due to the absence of children from the younger generation who want to develop education in their area. Not only has an impact on the education sector, but the regional economic sector will also have an impact because there are no innovations from the younger generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the field of climate, knowledge of climate is needed in maintaining, preserving, and managing archaeological remains in Karangturi Village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Religious Value</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The religious value possessed by Karangturi Village is the existence of religious tolerance in Karangturi Village. When associated with vulnerability in the social and economic fields, religious values can be destroyed if every individual has interests based on personal interests. Personal interests will make social values be destroyed by individuals who want to achieve their desires by all means. This also has an impact on the economic field which causes everything to be seen from an economic point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Culture Value</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Values owned In Karangturi Village there are various kinds of ethnicities and cultures. This cultural diversity can be seen from the cultural heritage owned, such as batik, dance, buildings, and so on. If it is related to the vulnerability of the social sector, over time the cultural diversity of the Karangturi village community, especially the younger generation, does not see cultural values as very important. A civilization can progress if there is a culture that is continuously nurtured and guarded. Cultural values can also have a positive impact on the economy of Karangturi Village in the form of cultural tourism. The existence of this positive impact can solve problems in the economic sector, namely the &nbsp;management &nbsp;of many</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">archeological &nbsp;remains in Karangturi</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Village. Income in the form of cultural tourism can be used as a solution for managing, preserving, and developing remains in Karangturi Village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Priority Policies, Conservation and Development Actions, and Public Services</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Public policy is a technique for allocating resources to achieve governmental aims and objectives. As a result, according to Roberts and Clark (1982), public policy is a set of actions made by a government to solve issues, make choices, assign resources or values, execute policies, and, in general, do what their constituents expect of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A policy certainly cannot be separated from the role of the policymaker, namely the government. In Indonesia, a policy can be issued by officials including the president, minister, DPR, governor, regent or mayor, and so on. In the management of archaeological resources in Karangturi Village and its surroundings, the Rembang Regency Government has designed a policy regulated in the 2005-2025 RPJPD of Rembang Regency regarding the direction of structuring and preserving heritage cities (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pemerintah Kabupaten Rembang</span><span class="font6">, &nbsp;2010:1-8). Based on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">direction of the 2005-2025 RPJPD of Rembang Regency, the medium- to longterm references for the Rembang Regency Heritage City Arrangement and Preservation Program include:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical Arrangement Program for Heritage Areas and the provision of supporting infrastructure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism promotion and cooperation development.</span></p></li>

<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Defining Stakeholders with a Management Framework</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The management framework for the management of archeological resources in Karangturi Village uses the framework of planning, organizing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Planning is an attempt to determine a program of activities that will be carried out to achieve a goal. The purpose is to experimentally identify the relationship between planning action and management and organizational growth using theoretical reasoning (Ufartiene, 2014:176). According to Hasibuan (2006:91), there are 4 basic reasons related to the importance of planning, namely: (1) Without a plan, there is no goal to be achieved. (2) Without planning a lot of waste because there are no implementation guidelines. (3) Plans are the basis of management because nothing works without a management plan. (4) There is no decision or administrative process without a plan. At this stage, all stakeholders must contribute to designing all actions and policies in the management of archeological resources in Karangturi Village. Stakeholders in this paper are related government agencies, community or community organizations, and the general public. Planning can be made in the form of main concepts and actions either directly or indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Organizing is the stage of designing responsibilities and authorities, determining positions that are grouped into certain sections, and planning the bureaucracy and the flow of coordination in its implementation (Jailani, 2018:5152). At this stage, a structure and coordination flow is needed. The organization in the management of archeological resources has a structure and coordination flow as follows, at the very top, government agencies are the holders of control in administration and planning. Under government agencies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">community organizations or communities will stand on a par with the local community (Karangturi Village). Under the social organization or community is the general public. All roles in the coordination flow will be interrelated and related.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Planning is the basic process of setting goals and achieving them. The existence of planning makes everything clear and directed. In connection with using good planning, planning that has great benefits is also needed (Rusniati &amp;&nbsp;Haq, 2014: 103-104).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Monitoring is an activity that aims to provide information about the causes and effects of the implemented policies. Monitoring is carried out when the policy is implemented. Monitoring has five objectives, namely: &nbsp;&nbsp;(1) evaluating</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">whether the activities carried out are by the plan; (2) identifying any problems that occur so that you can take immediate action; (3) evaluating whether the work and management patterns used are appropriate to achieve the objectives of the Activity; (4) knowing the relationship between activities to obtain a measure of progress; and (5) adapting activities to a changing environment, without deviating from the goal. Monitoring is needed to immediately find and correct errors that occur and to minimize the risk of a greater impact (Widiastuti &amp;&nbsp;Sutanto, 2014:196).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to monitoring, evaluation is also needed, where evaluation is an action or activity to evaluate the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">performance of a policy. Evaluation is carried out when the policy has been implemented for a long period. The evaluation aims to determine the level of work in a policy, measure the level of efficiency in the policy. Measuring the quality of results based on a policy, measuring positive and negative effects based on a policy, knowing if there is a deflection using a comparison of goals, using targets that have been achieved (Jailani, 2018:51-52). At the monitoring stage, stakeholders who have the right to monitor all implementation actions are all stakeholders involved, both from government agencies, community or community organizations, and the community. The involvement of all stakeholders has a positive impact, namely providing an evaluation for each party to create a better archeological resource management policy. Evaluation activities can be carried out at the end of the year while monitoring activities can be recommended every three months of the year so that they are maximized. The result should be published, hance society can find out the improvement of this program. Publication of the program can be socialized by the central government to the regional government, through social media such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and so on, and also informed through the official government website.</span></p>
