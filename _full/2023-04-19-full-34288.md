<p><span class="font2">Based on the background of the study above, the research problems that arise in this study are formulated as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What characterization of the main character is used and presented by the author in the movie “The Unborn”?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2.</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the main character presented in the movie “The Unborn” based on physiological, sociological, and psychological dimensions?</span></p></li>
<li>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aims of the Study</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Related to the problem of the study above, the aims of the study covers three things; they are are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To identify the characterization of the main character used and presented by the author in the movie “The Unborn”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To analyze and describe Casey as the main character presented in the movie “The Unborn” based on physiological, sociological, and psychological dimensions.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Research method is a very important step which conveys aspects in presenting the analysis of data. There are three aspects used in this research methods; they are: data source, method and technique of collecting data, and method and technique of analyzing data.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Source</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In scientific writing, data source is divided into two types; they are the primary data and secondary data sources. In this study, the data were collected from the primary data source taken from a horror movie entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Unborn”</span><span class="font2"> written by David S. Goyer. This movie was released in the United States on January 9, 2009 by Universal Pictures.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Collecting Data</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The data were collected using the documentation method. The working procedure is divided into several steps; they are: watching the movie in order to comprehend the script of this movie, taking note, and reading the theory of book and browsing the internet to obtain the information needed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Analyzing Data</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The collected data were presented using the qualitative method. It was used in the analysis which is presented descriptively using the theory of characterization based on the book entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“How to Analyze Fiction”</span><span class="font2"> proposed by William Kenney (1966). Then, the data were analyzed using the supporting theory proposed by Lajos Egri in Sukada </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Beberapa Aspek Tentang Sastra”</span><span class="font2"> (1987) to support the analysis.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method and Technique of Presenting the Result of Data Analysis</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In presenting the analyzed data, this study applied two types of methods. The data of physiological dimension was presented by categorizing the part of physical appearance according to Lajos Egri’s theory and using words descriptively. Besides, the analysis of physiological dimension was also supported by using figures (picture or illustration) to show the character’s physical look based on the movie scene. Meanwhile, the data of characterization, sociological dimension, and psychological dimension were presented using words for the description.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis</span><br><br><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Analysis of the Characterization</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The main character of the movie “The Unborn” is Casey Beldon. She was considered the main character, because she took the main role and became central character in the story. The author used the static character to present Casey’s character. However, the author applied the contextual method to present the way of the story.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type of Characterization of the Main Character</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Casey as the main character was identified that she had static character. The author created the main character of Casey min such a way that it did not afflict the changing </span><span class="font1">209</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of her personality in the story from the beginning until the end. In the scene of the movie before, it was told that Casey was hit by Matty with a mirror on her face. After hitting her, he told her about something by saying “Jumby Wants To Be Born Now” to Casey. From that incident, she retold back that incident to her boyfriend Mark, Romy, and Lisa that Matty had hit her and the statement “Jumby Wants To Be Born Now” which was still remembered by Casey. It could be proven in the following dialogue:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Casey sits at a table with her boyfriend, Mark Hardigan, who has his arm draped around her. He’s tall, good-looking, thoughtful. The perfect boyfriend. Across from them are Romy and Lisa Shepherd, another student. It’s lunchtime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Casey : Yeah. “Jumby wants to be born now.” And then he hit me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Lisa : That’s creepy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mark : The kid’s four. He probably didn’t even know what he was doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Romy : It’s bad luck, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Page:8)</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method of Characterization of the Main Character</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">To Casey as the main character in the movie “The Unborn”, the author used one method to explain the main character, that is: the contextual method. The author used such a method, because based on the context, he described the situation in the movie script, before he conveyed the conversation among the characters in the dialogues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the situation of the screenplay, the author tried to phrase the essence of the situation if Casey looked distressed. The author tried to tell something if Casey looked distressed by verbal context which was said by Sendak to her that she had mental illness. These quotations could be proven through the situation and dialog below: Sendak sighs, sitting back. He tries to phrase the following as delicately as he can, for Casey is clearly </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">distressed</span><span class="font2">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sendak : There’s no such thing as a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dybbuk</span><span class="font2">, Ms. Bell. At least not outside the realms of folklore. You have to understand, back in the Middle Ages, things like spirits and demons were really just a catchall for conditions people weren’t capable of properly diagnosing. There wasn’t any concept of ailments like schizophrenia or epilepsy. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Mental illness </span><span class="font2">as we know it didn’t exist back then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Casey : (defensive) I’m not mentally ill. What’s happening to me is real.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physiological, Sociological, and Psychological Dimension of the Main Character</span><br><br><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Analysis of Physiological Dimension of the Main Character</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Physiological dimension of the character can be observed through age, gender or sex, posture, appearance, height or weight, heredity, defects, skin, hair, color of eye and the way she or he dressed up. The description of situation which was related to Casey physiologically could be seen in the analysis below:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attractive, Brown Eyes and 19 years old</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the situation of the movie script, Casey was portrayed that she was attractive, intense with brown eyes and attained the age of 19 years old. It can be shown as the quotation of the situation of the script as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Presently, the woman slows to a stop, her shoulders rhythmically rising and falling as she breathes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Attractive, intense</span><span class="font2">, with soulful </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">brown eyes</span><span class="font2">. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">This is Casey Bell (19)</span><span class="font2">. Casey stares at an object on the ground a red knit glove. She picks it up. As she rises, she tenses…</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Page: 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From situation above, it can be proved and supported that she had brown eyes and attained the age of 19 years old in the scene shot of the movie when she stopped her steps and stared at an object on the ground; it can be shown as follows :</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/34288-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:395pt;height:204pt;">
<p><span class="font2">(00:02:13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the scene shot of the movie above, Casey was portrayed attractive and intense which enclosed the meaning that she was beautiful and sturdy. She also had soulful brown eyes. This scene showed that Casey stopped her jogging and stared at an object with her soulful brown eyes. She rhythmically showed her shoulders rising and falling as she breathed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Analysis of Sociological Dimension of the Main Character</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The environment gives feedbacks to the development of one’s character including the relationship of one character to another character. In this case, her relationship with other characters which improved Casey’s description in her social aspect in the story of the movie is as follows.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>1. Relationship Between Casey and Romy</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">Romy Marshall was a best friend of Casey in the story of movie. She was very kind and really cared about Casey. It was told that Romy came for Casey to Casey’s house to find her that she was in good condition, because she wanted to know the reason why Casey had not been in class. Although, Casey told Romy that she should keep away from her, Romy did not obey exhortation of Casey. She convinced to Casey that she was her best friend and she did not want to leave her. The following quotation could be seen as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Romy : What’s going on, Case? You haven’t been in class. You have been answering your phone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Casey : Because Sofi told me to. It’s real, Romy. Everything that’s been happening. It’s real. It’s some kind of ghost or demon or something. It tried to take over my brother. That’s why my mother went crazy. She knew it wouldn’t stop there. She knew it would eventually come for me. You need to stay away from me. It’s not safe to be around me anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Romy : I’m your best friend. I’m not just going to abandon you.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Analysis of Psychological Dimension of the Main Character</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Psychological factor is one of important things which have been owned by all human beings. Everybody cannot be complete without psychological side, because it is natural aspect which has cling in each individual. There are psychological conditions of Casey’s which described through the analysis as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfriendly</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In this scene of the movie, it started when Casey entered her living room. She found that her father and her father’s girlfriend named Allison were cuddling on the couch. Casey showed her unfriendly attitude to her father and Allison by greeting and giving farewell to them impolitely. It also showed if Casey had unfriendly sense to Allison, when Allison asked her about her sitting. However, Casey merely said “Fine” and it seemed that she did not want to engage to talk more with Allison. It could be proven through the following dialogue:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Casey enters, shedding her coat at the door, trying to shake the feeling of unease. We follow her into the livingroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Casey : Hey, Dad. Allison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gordon Bell (40s), is cuddling on the couch with his girlfriend, Allison Thayer (30s). They’re watching a movie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Allison : How was sitting, Casey?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Casey : (not wanting to engage) Fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Though they’re cordial enough, we sense that Casey and Allison aren’t particularly friendly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gordon : There’s cheesecake from Ricardo’s, if you want it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Casey : Thanks, but I think I’m just going to crash. Night, you guys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Casey continues on her way.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">From the analysis of the first problem in the third chapter it could be concluded that in the characterization of the movie, there were two parts of characterization which had been analyzed in scope of the type of characterization and method characterization. In</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the type of characterization, it could be concluded that the author used the static character to present the main character. In the method of characterization, the author used the contextual method to present the main character by describing the situation in the movie script, before he conveyed to us about the conversation among the characters in the dialogues.
