<p><span class="font0">This study analyses words and phrases used for addressing in the translation of religious-cultural terms of address in the Luke’s Bible. Their profiles and attitudes, techniques, methods, and ideologies applied as well as factors leading to and their impacts towards the degree of accuracy, readability, and acceptability were qualitatively described.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The data were taken from the Luke’s English Bible and their translations into Balinese. First, the terms of address found in the source text were compared with those found in the target text with reference to the appraisal theoretical framework to identify the social stratifications to which the addressee belongs to, which was then applied to identify what translation techniques were applied. The formal and dynamic equivalence (de Ward and Nida, 1986: 36), and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">V</span><span class="font0"> diagram of the translation method (New Mark, 1988: 45) were employed to show the translation orientations closely related to the translation ideology itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The findings show that: (1) the choice of the linguistic variants in the target language was influenced by the dimensions of attitude: affect, judgment, and appreciation, either (positive [+], or negative [-]) among the participants; (2) there were 12 translation techniques applied, two of which were the technique of calque and literal (0.06%) which were oriented towards the source language, 0.02% was ‘gray’, and the rest, that is, 99.2% was oriented towards the target language. The dominance of the translation techniques which were oriented towards the target language shows that there was a great cultural difference between the source text and the target text; (3) the dominance of the translation communicative method and the domestication ideology shows that, when the translation process took place, the translator’s orientation was towards the target reader; (4) the linguistic factor, the religious-cultural difference, and the translator’s preference led to the translation techniques, methods and ideologies applied to translating the terms of address in the Luke’s Bible; (5) the translation techniques, methods, and ideologies employed, positively contributed to the quality of the translation, causing the translation product to be highly accurate, intelligible, and culturally acceptable to the target reader.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Theoretically, it could be difficult to translate the English Bible into Balinese, as a consequence of the two differences in linguistic and religious-cultural systems. However, the fact that parts of the Bible have been translated into 822 out of 3000 local languages, including Balinese language, empirically shows that it has been possible to translate the Bible. The problem which has been frequently encountered by the Bible’s translator has been that it has been difficult for him/her to translate the basic meanings in the source language (hereon abbreviated to SL) into the target language (hereon abbreviated to TL) so accurately that the translation equivalent can be easily understood and highly acceptable to the norms and cultural values of the TL.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Five basic problems are discussed in this research. They are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were the profile and attitude of the English terms of address in the Luke’s Bible and their translation equivalents in Balinese language?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What techniques were applied to translate the terms of address found in the Luke’s Bible?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What methods and ideologies were employed to translate the terms of address in the Luke’s Bible?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What factors leading to the application of such techniques, methods and ideologies to the translation of the terms of address in the Luke’s Bible?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were the impacts of the application of such techniques, methods and ideologies on the degree of accuracy, the degree of intelligibility, and the degree of acceptability of the translation of the terms of address found in the Luke’s Bible?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">Terms of address are words and phrases used for addressing (Braun, 1988: 5). The choice of words or phrases used by the addresser for addressing the addressee in a successive communicative event reflects the cultural norms and values applicable to the language used. Being patterned in a system, the forms and profile of the terms of address</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">can be explored for comparison. The expressive and proportional meanings have caused the linguistic variants in the TL to vary.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The theory of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">T-V</span><span class="font0"> introduced by Brown-Gilman (1960) and Braun (1988), its extension as the theory of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tn-Vn</span><span class="font0">: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Xn</span><span class="font0">, which has been further developed and combined with the theory of Appraisal (Hope and Read: 2004) and Qian Hong (2007) were used to analyze the data obtained. The formal and dynamic or functional approach introduced by Nida (1964: 159) and de Waard and Nida (1986: 36) were employed to analyze the translation equivalents of the English terms of address in Balinese language. Such an approach was used on the basis that the theory of translation is basically related to two contradictory philosophies. They are formal equivalence and dynamic or functional equivalence.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theory of Appraisal</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Based on what is stated by Braun (1988:64) that the address system affects a speaker’s perception of social relationship and is directed at the addressee (Braun, 1988: 294), the attitude and the theory of appraisal can be further developed and combined with his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">T-V</span><span class="font0"> theory when indicating and positioning the participants in an interactional event. The form, function and meaning of such extended theory can be presented in the following table.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theory of Dynamic Equivalence</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Nida (in Venuty, 2004: 129) differentiates the basic orientations into two. The first orientation is the formal equivalence and the second is the dynamic equivalence. The formal equivalence, which only highlights the accuracy of the lexical meanings between the SL and TL texts, has long been opposed with Nida’s scheme of dynamic equivalence (1982: 22-24). The dynamic equivalence evaluates translation not only from the criteria of the formal correspondence between the two texts, but also from the reader’s point of view so that the result will be textually and contextually meaningful, as can be seen from the following model:</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/3547-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:290pt;height:134pt;">
<p><span class="font0">In the dynamic equivalence, the evaluator of the quality of the translation equivalence focuses not only on the formal equivalent of T2 text of T1 text but also on the translation effect that the receiver of R1 (the native speaker of the SL) and the receiver of R2 (the native speaker of TL) would give the same response, that is, the translation effect (compared to the arrows of R3 and S3 which extend to R1 and R2). Certainly, the matters of equivalence can be explained through the questionnaire distributed to the native speaker of the SL and the native speaker of the TL.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">The English terms of address appear 1895 times and 12 translation techniques were used to translate them. The translating techniques were dominantly oriented towards the TL, as can be seen from the following model. This shows that the cultural gap between the SL and TL with regard to their terms of address is so great, and indicates that the translation process is oriented towards the target reader. This orientation indicates that the communicative translation method and the domestication ideology have been applied to the translation of the terms of address in the Luke’s Bible into Balinese language.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/3547-2.png" alt="" style="width:392pt;height:264pt;">
<p><span class="font0">The linguistic and cultural differences and the translator’s preference have led to the application of particular technique, method and ideology to the translation of the terms of address in the Luke’s Bible. Out of the 1895 appearances of the English terms of address, 14 have not been accurately translated and have been less acceptable to the target reader, and one can be stated not to be intelligible.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Findings</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Five new findings have been found in the translation of the religious-cultural terms of address in Luke’s Bible. They are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pronouns: the theory of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tn – Vn</span><span class="font0"> introduced by Braun (1988) can be further developed and extended to the theory of appraisal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tn – Vn : Xn</span><span class="font0">. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Xn</span><span class="font0"> refers to the third person.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nouns: five have been found out of the nine proposed by Braun (1988). No noun referring to degree has been found. The different setting between the source culture and target culture has been responsible for this. Any noun which refers to the abstract noun of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Your Excellency</span><span class="font0"> has not been found either. The reason is that the term of address of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Your Excellency</span><span class="font0"> is not in existent in the TL; therefore, the technique of deletion was applied by the translator. In addition, neither term of address for noun of relation has been found. The reason is that the interactions of address are dominated by the vertical ones (up and down and vice versa) between Jesus and his followers. And the reason why no term of address in the form of any noun of expression has been found is that in the Luke’s Bible the participants always use direct terms of address in the form of proper names. As far as the data obtained were concerned, terms of address in the form foreign proper nouns have been found.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inversion: the translation in the form of shifts from pronouns to nouns, both indicating blood-kin and non blood-kin, was made not only to express the role of the speaker (P1), as proposed by Braun (1988: 12), but also to express the social meaning of the P2’s role (addressee’s role).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shifts: the linguistic and cultural differences between the two languages have been responsible for the application of the technique of shifts; transposition and modulation cannot be avoided.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reciprocal/non reciprocal: not all terms of address using the forms of address in dyad are called both reciprocal and non reciprocal; in contrast, those using different forms of address are called non reciprocal and asymmetrical; as stated by Brown &amp;&nbsp;Gilman in Braun (1988: 12).</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusions and Recommendations</span><br><br><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusions</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Progression of interaction among the SL speakers shows that there is no influence of class distribution on the choice of terms of address in the form of personal pronouns. In contrast, in the TL the choice of terms of address in the form of words or phrases are highly influenced by the class distribution of the participants and by the nature of relationship which is influenced by the dimension of attitude: affect, judgment, and appreciation, either positive ( [+], or [-] ) of the addresser in indicating and positioning the addressee or someone they are talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The dominance of the technique oriented towards the TL (99.94%) indicates that there is a cultural gap between the source text and the target text as far as terms of address are concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The translation method and translation ideology which are dominantly used are the communicative translation and the domestication ideology. This indicates that in the translating process, the translation is oriented toward the target reader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Three factors which are identified to lead to the translating technique, translation method and ideology applied to this translation are (1) the differences in linguistic system between the SL and TL; (2) the cultural difference between the SL and TL; and (3) the translator’s preference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The translating technique, the translation method and ideology applied to the translation of the Luke’s Bible contributed highly positively to the quality of the translation with regard to its accuracy, acceptability and readability.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendations</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Attitude, which is part of the appraisal theory, is highly helpful to the researcher in determining the distribution and stratification of the classes the participants belong to. This has allowed the researcher to explore the translation process through the translation product. It will be good if further researches on the relationship of the choice of terms of address to verbs or adjectives in other texts with the extended theory of appraisal such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">engagement</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">graduation</span><span class="font0"> in LFS are conducted.</span></p>
