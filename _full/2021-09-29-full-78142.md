<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Abstract</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">This article discussed about morphosyntax that deals with the combination of morphology and syntax. The article was aimed to find out the derivational suffixes forming adjectives and the syntactic functions of the adjectives found in the data source. The data of this article were taken by library research method and note-taking technique from the novel Forrest Gump, which published in 157 pages and 26 chapters by Pocket Books in 1994. This novel is written by Winston Groom. The collected data were analyzed descriptive qualitatively based on the theory of Morphology and Syntax by Quirk, et al (1985). This article revealed that there were the attachment of suffix {-ful}, {-less}, {-ly}, {-y}, {-al}, {-ial}, {-ic} and {-ous} changed the base noun into adjective, it is called denominal adjectives</span><span class="font3">. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Then, deverbal adjectives which made the word class changed from verb into adjective, there were the attachment of suffix {-able} and {-ive}. Meanwhile, for the syntactic functions there were three types found, they are attributive, predicative and postpositive.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Artikel ini membahas tentang morfosintaksis yaitu kombinasi dari morfologi dan sintaksis. Artikel ini bertujuan untuk mendapatkan akhiran derivatif yang membentuk kata sifat dan fungsi sintaksis dari kata sifat yang ditemukan di sumber data. Data dari artikel ini menggunakan metode penelitian kepustakaan dan teknik mencatat dari novel berjudul Forrest Gump, yang dipublikasikan dalam 157 halaman dan 26 bab oleh Pocket Books pada tahun 1994. Novel ini ditulis oleh Winston Groom. Data yang terkumpul dianalisis menggunakan metode deskriptif kualitatif berdasarkan teori morfologi dan sintaksis oleh Quirk, et al (1985). Artikel ini menyatakan bahwa dengan ditambahkannya suffix {-ful}, {-less}, {-ly}, {-y}, {-al}, &nbsp;&nbsp;{-ial}, {-ic} dan {-ous} dapat merubah kata benda menjadi kata sifat yang disebut kata</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sifat denominal. Lalu kata sifat deverbal yang mana dapat merubah kelas kata dari kata kerja menjadi kata sifat, yaitu ditambahkannya akhiran {-able} dan {-ive}. Sementara itu, untuk fungsi sintaksis ada tiga jenis yang ditemukan, yaitu atributif, predikatif dan pospositif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kata kunci: derivasional, akhiran kata sifat, fungsi sintaksis</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Language is an essential tool to communicate to each other. To be able to communicate well we should know a lot of vocabulary. We all might understand what words are. Lieber (2009:2), defined morphology as a study of word formation, including the ways new words are coined in the language of the world and the way forms of words are varied depending on how they are</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">used in sentences. In studying morphology, words are made up of morphemes. According to Yule (2010:67), morpheme is a minimal unit of meaning or grammatical function. A single word that is formed by a single morpheme can occur by itself, not attached to other morphemes called free morpheme. While a bound morpheme may not; it must always be attached to another morpheme. According to Brinton (2000:77),</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vol. 28 No.2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">English has two kinds of affixes, prefixes, which attach to the beginnings of base and suffixes, which attach to the end of the base. But some language regularly, use infixes, which are inserted in the middle of the words. Then there are two types of affixes, derivational and inflectional. Derivational affixes have two functions: to convert one part of speech to another it is called class changing and to change the meaning of the root, in which case it is called class maintaining. The function of inflectional affixes is to indicate grammatical meaning such as tense or number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are some processes of word formation stated by Brinton (2000:85-100), they are derivation, reduplication, functional shift, compound, blend, back formation, shortening and root creation. From the all processes of word formation, derivation is very interesting to be analyzed since it can change the wordclass of the base lexeme that can form a new word. Derivation not only changes the structure and meaning of the word, it also may change the grammatical structure of a sentence. As the part of micro linguistics this article was focused not only with the morphology but also with syntax that deals with sentence structure. Therefore, the combination of two branches of that micro linguistics is called morphosyntax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the phenomenon above, this article was focused on the types of derivational adjectives and the syntactic functions of derivational adjectives from novel entitled Forrest Gump by Groom (1994) based on Quirk, et al (1985).</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Material And Method</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This article was focused on identifying the derivational adjectives and syntactic functions of derivational adjectives which were used in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Forrest Gump</span><span class="font3"> novel, which is written by Winston Groom and published by Pocket Books in 1994. The novel can be considered to be unique and interesting, since it tell us the life story of the main character that announces straightaway that he is an idiot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There were several steps to collect the data. First, the data were collected by reading the novel repeatedly. Second, the data found were noted and highlighted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Third, the data were being classified based on the types. The samples of the collected data then were taken and typed to make it easier in analyzed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The collected data analyzed in descriptive qualitative method. Analyzing the data consists of several steps. First, the data from the novel were classified based on the types of adjectival suffixes by Quirk, et al (1985). Second, derivational adjectives were separated from their suffixes to know the internal structure and the morphological process were analyzed in the form of tree diagram. Third, the meaning of derivational adjectives and their bases before attached by suffixes were explained based on the definition from Oxford Dictionary of English and Oxford Learner’s Pocket Dictionary in order to know their meaning after undergoing derivational process. And the last, the position of derivational adjectives were analyzed into syntactic functions of adjective by Quirk, et al (1985) using tree diagram. Lastly, the results of the data analysis were presented in informal method.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical Basis</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Analyzing derivational adjectives is not a new topic of discussion. In the literature review, there are some articles which have similar topic with the current article. Those articles were reviewed to support the process of this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Antari (2018) found in her article that there were derivational suffixes that can change the word class from noun and verb into adjective. There are ten suffixes found, they are suffix –fil, -able, -ish, -ous, -al, -ic, -less, -y, -ive, -ly. Meanwhile, for the syntactic functions there are two types found, they are predicative and attributive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mahendra (2017) showed that there are four derivational suffixes, they are nominal suffixes, verbal suffixes, adjectival suffixes and adverbial suffixes. And the functions of the derivational suffixes can be divided into two, they are class maintaining suffix and class changing suffix.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Kusumawardhani (2018) in her article stated that there are some derivational morphology found in this research; derivation of a noun, adverb, gerund after a preposition, gerund after the verb, to-infinitive, present participle, passive participle, modals and adjectives</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Types of Derivational Adjectives Based on Adjectival Suffixes</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Derivation often used by linguists to mean only formation by the addition of affixes. It may change the meaning of the base to which they attached and change the word class that a base belongs to. Word formation rules (especially in suffixation) apply only to items of specific derivation. It can be called denominal, deverbal, so that deverbal adjective mean adjective derived from verb, and denominal adjective, is an adjective derived from a noun. Adjective can be formed by word class or bases with some suffixes. It means the attachment of certain suffixes demonstrated the changing of word class (noun, verb, and adjective) into adjective. According to Quirk, et al (1985: 1552-1556), there are ten adjectival suffixes that can be attached to noun and verb to form an adjective, they are {-ful}, {-ish}, {-less}, {-ly}, {-y}, ({-al}, {-ial}, {-ical}), {-ic}, ({-ous},{-ious}), {-able}, and {-ive}.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Syntactic Functions of Adjective</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">According to Quirk, et al (1985: 416-418), the adjective has three functions; they are attributive, predicative and postpositive. Adjectives are attributive when they pre-modify the head of a noun phrase and always appear between after determiner and before head of noun phrase, including zero determiner. It describes noun or noun phrase and often creates the meaning as well. Attributive adjective also can be said as noun modifier. Predicative adjective is an adjective which occurs after a verb in sentence and modifies the subject. In this case the adjective is as modifier of noun and can be said as complement. Predicative adjective has function as subject or object complement. Adjectives can sometimes be postpositive, they can immediately follow by the noun or pronoun. In another words, adjective may have postpositive position, because sometimes it appears after noun or pronoun.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Derivational Adjectives Based on the Attachment of Adjectival Suffixes</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In this article, the types of derivational adjectives are divided into two namely, denominal and deverbal adjectives which are formed by adding the types of adjectival suffixes to the base, based on the standard English grammar by Quirk, et al (1985). There are ten</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">adjectival suffixes that can be attached to noun and verb to form a new word, adjective. They are suffix {-ful}, {-ish}, {-less}, {-ly}, {-y}, ({-al}, {-ial}, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{-ical}), {</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ic}, ({-ous},{-ious}), {-able}, and {-ive}.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Suffix {–ful}</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dreadful</span><span class="font3"> sight, people set on fire an all, an nothin we could do. (Groom,1994:32).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dreadful</span><span class="font3"> is denominal adjective, it is derived from a free morpheme dread as the base and a bound morpheme {–ful} as the adjectival suffix. As a noun, according to Oxford Dictionary of English and Oxford Learner’s Pocket Dictionary, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dread</span><span class="font3"> means great apprehension, fear or anxiety. After the attachment of suffix {–ful} at the end of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dread</span><span class="font3"> the word class changes from a noun (dread) into an adjective (dreadful). Therefore, as an adjective, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dreadful</span><span class="font3"> means causing or involving great suffering, fear, unhappiness; extremely bad or serious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Suffix {–less}</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I’m a goddamn </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">legless</span><span class="font3"> freak. (Groom, 1994:97)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">legless</span><span class="font3"> is derived from a free morpheme </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">leg</span><span class="font3"> as the base and a bound morpheme {–less} as the adjectival suffix. It is called denominal adjective. As a noun, in accordance with Oxford Dictionary of English and Oxford Learner’s Pocket Dictionary, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">leg</span><span class="font3"> means each of the limbs on that connect the feet to the rest of the body which a person or animal walks and stand. Since the attachment of suffix {–less} at the end of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">leg</span><span class="font3"> causes the word class changes from a noun (leg) into an adjective (legless). It means the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">legless</span><span class="font3"> has undergone a derivational process that also changes its meaning. Therefore, as an adjective, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">legless </span><span class="font3">means having no legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Suffix {–ly}</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They axed me a lot of question an was real nice an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">friendly</span><span class="font3"> sounding (Groom, 1994: 133).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word friendly is denominal adjective, it is derived from (friend) + {-ly}. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Friendly</span><span class="font3"> comes from a free morpheme (friend) as the base and a bound morpheme {–ly}as the adjectival suffix. As a noun, in accordance with Oxford Dictionary of English and Oxford Learner’s Pocket Dictionary, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">friend</span><span class="font3"> means a person with whom one has a bond of mutual affection,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vol. 28 No.2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">typically one exclusive of sexual or family relations. Since the attachment of suffix &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{–ly} at the end of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">friend</span><span class="font3"> causes the word class changes from a noun (friend) into an adjective (friendly). It means the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">friendly</span><span class="font3"> has undergone a derivational process that also slightly changes its meaning. Therefore, as an adjective, f</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">riendly</span><span class="font3"> means kind and pleasant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Suffix {–y}</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The italic word above is denominal adjective. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">curly</span><span class="font3"> is derived from (curl) + {-ly}. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Curly </span><span class="font3">comes from a free morpheme curl as the base and a bound morpheme {–y} as the adjectival suffix. As a noun, according to Oxford Dictionary of English and Oxford Learner’s Pocket Dictionary, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">curl</span><span class="font3"> means something in the shape of a spiral or coil, especially a lock of hair. After the attachment of suffix {–y} at the end of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">curl</span><span class="font3"> makes the word class changes from a noun (curl) into an adjective (curly). It means the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">curly</span><span class="font3"> has undergone a derivational process that also slightly changes its meaning. Therefore, as an adjective, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">curly</span><span class="font3"> means made, growing, or arranged in curls or curves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Suffix {–al}</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">She commences to start stroking me in a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">personal</span><span class="font3"> way. (Groom, 1994: 11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word personal is derived from (person) + {-al}. it is called denominal adjective. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Personal</span><span class="font3"> comes from a free morpheme (person) as the base and a bound morpheme {–al} as the adjectival suffix. As a noun, in accordance with Oxford Dictionary of English and Oxford Learner’s Pocket Dictionary, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">person</span><span class="font3"> means a human being regarded as an individual. Since the attachment of suffix {–al} at the end of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">person </span><span class="font3">makes the word class changes from a noun (person) into an adjective (personal). It means the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">personal</span><span class="font3"> has undergone a derivational process that also slightly changes its meaning. Therefore, as an adjective, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">personal</span><span class="font3"> means belonging to or affecting a particular person rather than anyone else.</span></p>

As a noun, according to Oxford Dictionary of English and Oxford Learner’s Pocket Dictionary, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">artifice</span><span class="font3"> means clever or cunning devices or expedients, especially as used to trick or deceive others. Since the attachment of suffix {–ial} at the end of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">artifice</span><span class="font3"> makes the word class changes from a noun (artifice) into an adjective (artificial). In this case, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">artificial</span><span class="font3"> ended by –e, after undergoing a morphological process, the vowel –e was omitted because there is no meaning for word ‘artificeial’. It means the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">artificial</span><span class="font3"> had undergone a derivational process that also slightly changes its meaning. Therefore, as an adjective, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">artificial</span><span class="font3"> means made or produced by human beings rather than occurring naturally, especially as a copy of something natural.</span></p>

After the attachment of suffix {–able} at the end of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">recognize</span><span class="font3"> makes the word class changes from a verb (recognize) into an adjective (recognizable). In this case, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">recognize</span><span class="font3"> ended by –e, after undergoing a morphological process, the vowel –e was omitted because there is no meaning for word ‘recognizeable’. It means the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">recognizable</span><span class="font3"> has undergone a derivational process that also slightly changes its meaning. Therefore, as an adjective, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">recognizable </span><span class="font3">means able to be recognized or identified from previous encounters or knowledge.</span></p>

Since</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the attachment of suffix {–ive} at the end of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">offend</span><span class="font3"> causes the word class changes from a verb (offend) into an adjective (offensive). In this case, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">offend</span><span class="font3"> ended by –d, after undergoing a morphological process, the consonant –d is changed into the consonant –s, then consonant -d was omitted because there is no meaning for word ‘offendive’. It means the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">offensive</span><span class="font3"> has undergone a derivational process that also slightly changes its meaning. Therefore, as an adjective, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">offensive</span><span class="font3"> means causing someone to feel resentful, upset or annoyed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There are three syntactic functions that proposed by Quirk, et al (1985:416-418) found in this article, they were attributive adjective, predicative and postpositive adjective.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Based on the tree diagram above, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lovely</span><span class="font3"> has syntactic function as attributive adjective, since it followed by and pre-modify the head of noun ‘site’, also it appears after determiner (article) ‘a’. And as a noun modifier in that sentence, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lovely</span><span class="font3"> explained that site was so attractive. Nevertheless, before undergoing with morphological process, the word lovely (Adj) is derived from love (N). The syntactic function of word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font3"> in a sentence will be different. For example, in the sentence, “They fell in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font3">”.

<p><span class="font3">On the basis of the tree diagram above, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">disgraceful</span><span class="font3"> has functioned as a predicative adjective. Since it appears after a copular verb ‘was’. Therefore, it described that was something shockingly unacceptable. Even so, before having the morphological process, the word disgraceful (Adj) is derived from disgrace (N). The syntactic function of word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">disgrace</span><span class="font3"> in a sentence will be change. For example, in the sentence, “He left the army in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">disgrace</span><span class="font3">”. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">disgrace</span><span class="font3"> had functioned as object of preposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Postpositive</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Welcome Grandmaster’s Invitational Chess Tournament. (Groom, 1994:120)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And it described that welcoming the invitation of grandmaster in the chess tournament. Nevertheless, before having the morphological process, the word invitational (Adj) is derived from invitation (N). The syntactic function of word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">invitation</span><span class="font3"> in a sentence will be different. For example, in the sentence, “The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">invitation</span><span class="font3"> was addressed to all the three of them”. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">invitation</span><span class="font3"> had functioned as a subject of a verb.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Based on the foregoing analysis, it can be concluded that there were denominal and deverbal adjectives found in the data as types of derivational adjectives. The attachment of suffix {-ful}, {-less}, {-ly}, {-y}, {-al}, {-ial}, {-ic} and {-ous} changed the base noun into adjective, it is called denominal adjective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The analysis also showed that the data contain of three syntactic functions of derivational adjectives, there were attributive adjective appears after determiner and followed by noun phrase, also has function as a noun modifier, predicative adjective appears after a verb modifies the subject, also called as subject complement and postpositive adjective it shows up after noun.</span></p>
