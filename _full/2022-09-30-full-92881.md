<p><span class="font1">The COVID-19 pandemic has given a negative impact on Sanur tourism, therefore a strategy for handling the impact of COVID-19 pandemic is needed for the restoration of Sanur tourism. This study aims to determine the strategies of tourism actors in handling the impact of COVID-19. This research uses a qualitative approach with a case study research strategy. The method used is observation, interviews, questionnaires and documentation. The theory used is perception theory to identify visitor perceptions and sustainable tourism theory to analyze the effectiveness of implementing strategies for Sanur tourism actors. The results show that the visitor's perception of the image of the Sanur destination is very good, it can be seen from the information received by visitors from Sanur tourism actors is clear, and the end understands the risks and threats when visiting so that visitors do not want to change their travel plans to Sanur. The strategies carried out by Sanur tourism actors are Reduction, Readiness, Response and Recovery. The effectiveness of implementing the strategy is seen from the environmental aspect, namely improving and rejuvenating the environment, the economic aspect of increasing tourist visits and the social aspect of growing awareness (awareness) of tourism actors and the community in the Sanur destination of the risks caused by disasters. The government and tourism actors need synergy in dealing with the impact of disasters on tourism so that they can help and speed up the handling process and minimize the negative impacts that arise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Tourism is defined as a journey or travel to a certain place or several other places, so that a trip is very necessary for tourism activities, therefore any factors that hinder travel will indirectly have an</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">impact on tourism industry. International issues, such as COVID-19 (Corona virus) pandemic is an example of this impact. This kind of disaster has again shown the vulnerability of the tourism industry (Jiang &amp;&nbsp;Ritchie, 2017). Based on Act No. 24 Year 2007, disasters can be grouped into three causes, namely: 1. Natural disaster, it</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">is a disaster that originate from natural phenomena such as floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and others. 2. Non-Natural Disaster, an event caused by non-natural factors, including technological failures, modernization failures, epidemics, and disease outbreaks. 3. Social Disasters, are disasters caused by events or series of events caused by humans, including social conflicts between groups, communities and terrorism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Various disasters greatly affect the sustainability of tourism. The causes of the obstruction of a tourism travel include Tsunami disaster (Ghaderi &amp;&nbsp;Henderson, 2013), earthquakes (Huan et al, 2004), terrorist activity (Bowen et al. 2014; Samit-aset al. 2018), extreme climate change (Becken, 2005), health and security issues or conflicts (Fotiadis &amp;&nbsp;Huan, 2014), and so on. There are several disasters that have directly Shaked up tourism, such as terrorism (the tragedy of the hijacking of American Airline Flight 11 which crashed into the World Trade Center Building in North Tower on 11 September 2001, the Bali 1 bombing incident in 2002 and the Bali 2 bombing in 2001). 2005, Madrid train bombings in 2004, London public transport bombings in 2005, Mumbai bombings in 2008, Boston bombings in 2013, Kenya mall attacks 2013). Earthquake and tsunami natural disasters (Aceh Earthquake and Tsunami in 2004, Japan Tsunami in 2011, Tsunami Christchurch in 2011). Hurricane and cyclone natural disasters (Hurricane Katrinia of 2005, Hurricane Huricane Sandy of 2012). Volcanic eruptions (Mount Agung Bali in 2017), global financial and economic crises in 20082010 and disasters or disease pandemics (Foot and mouth in 2001, Serve acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] in 2003, Avian Influenza [ H5N1] in 2003, and those that we have experienced from 2019 up to this present is the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 [SARS-CoV2] in 2019 until now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bali is a province in Indonesia that relies heavily on tourism activities, therefore seeing the vulnerability of tourism of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">course also makes Bali very vulnerable to the impact of disasters caused by natural, non-natural or social disasters. In the last 10 years Bali has been recorded to have experiences of several disasters with a fairly large capacity; in 2002 Bali and its tourism were again shaken by acts of terrorism. More than 200 people were killed in this bombing incident, while more than 200 others were seriously injured and having minor injuries (edun-itas.com 2005). As a result, there has been a decline in the number of tourists coming to Bali, three months after the Bali bombing, the condition of Bali's tourism has not shown any signs of recovery. The condition of Bali's tourism at that time, especially in Denpasar City was getting uncertain, hotel occupancy rates were reduced, there were cancellations due to tourists' fear of the threat of terrorism, the average hotel occupancy was still below 30%. Meanwhile, the number of foreign tourist visits at that time ranged from 1500 to 2000 people per day. (Denpasar-kota.com 2006). The absence of tourists, both domestic and international, causes the hotel business to have a very bad impact. These impacts even lead to the loss of business potential and it is unclear when will the Covid-19 pandemic situation soon end (Suryaningsih, et al 2021).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition, one of the disasters that shaked Bali up and its tourism was a natural disaster caused by the eruption of the highest mountain on the island of Bali, namely Mount Agung in 2018. This mountain is an active volcanic mountain, however, Mount Agung Bali was last recorded as a volcanic mountain that erupted in 1963, to be precise, on March 17, 1963. Consequently, there were around 1,600 people declared dead in the eruption (Kompas.com 2021). In 2018 Mount Agung Bali erupted again, the threat of the eruption of Mount Agung resulted in many tourists canceling their travel plan to visit Bali, other than that, tourists who had traveled and still in Bali made their visit time shortened. Then this condition was exacerbated by the closure of the I Gusti Ngurah </span><span class="font1">e-ISSN 2407-392X. p-ISSN 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rai International airport for two days due to volcanic ash eruptions which disrupted flights, this also resulted in the closure of access for foreign tourists who wanted to come directly to Bali. These conditions have caused the hotel room occupancy rate in Bali to reach 15%. Besides the eruption of Mount Agung, in August 2018 the island of Bali experienced 7 SC magnitude earthquake was followed by several aftershocks and the epicenter at that time was located on the island of Lombok.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Currently, Bali tourism is being tested again with the COVID-19 pandemic, the COVID-19 outbreak has begun to endemic since the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, is now spreading throughout the world. Until mid-March 2020, the Corona virus has infected as many as 185 countries with more than 270 thousand people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The current impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the island of Bali is harder when compared to the Bali bombings and the eruption of Mount Agung. Because, during Mount Agung erupted, the occupancy rate of hotels in southern Bali such as Badung, Denpasar and Gianyar still reached 60%, this was due to the dangerous radius of the eruption of Mount being only 12 KM away and when Bali experienced the Bali BOM I and II tragedy 10 last year the hotel room occupancy rate at that time was still at 20%, quoted from Bisnis.com (2020). The chairman of the Indonesian Hotel and Restaurant Association or PHRI of Badung Regency IGA Rai Suryawijaya said that Bali's economy is currently the worst condition in existing history, because the hotel occupancy rate reaches zero (zero).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The vulnerability of a destination to disasters that occur often leads to strengthening mitigation plans to equalize the perception that tourism area development cannot be separated from disaster mitigation. Even though there is no benchmark or best method in tourism recovery after a disaster or crisis. Models that have been effective in dealing with some past disasters may not work for other planners (Mansour, 2013). </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition, the development of a tourism area without preparing disaster mitigation can have an impact on the high risk or potential impact of losses and victims caused by disasters in the future. We can see several approaches in handling disasters and minimizing the impact of victims from the disaster, such as the presence of evacuation signs (warnings/signs/danger signs, coast guard posts/Search and Rescue (SAR)/ Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD), loudspeakers, and early warning systems), evacuation routes, gathering points, and health protocols and logos such as the application of CHSE in an effort to minimize the spread of the COVID-19 virus in a tourist destination. Therefore, it is very important to know the perception of tourists in visiting a destination and to examine the handling strategies that are carried out in overcoming the impact of disasters, in this case the researchers conducted research in Sanur tourism area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sanur tourism area is very interesting to study because in terms of control, they have their own organization called YPS (Sanur Development Foundation), YPS's involvement is enermous in Sanur tourism development. It is certain that in implementing a strategy for handling disaster impacts, it is necessary to have support from tourism actors themselves, such as YPS. In addition, Sanur has a very strategic and important position for the city of Denpasar because Sanur contributes 40% of PAD (Regional Local Revenue) and 80% of the total PHR (Hotel and Restaurant Tax) in Denpasar is generated in Sanur. very large (Balipost.com, 2019).</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Toward Tourism of Sanur</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The Tourism actors in Sanur remain optimistic that COVID-19 will end soon because the majority of the population of Sanur depend on the tourism economy for their livelihood, this chain effect has resulted in many sectors being paralyzed.

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The Strategies of Tourism Actors in Sanur Tourism Area</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Reduction in this research is a step or stage of reducing the impact of disaster or the COVID-19 pandemic caused in the initial phase by detecting and identifying sources of risk to prevent the emergence of a tourism crisis. The reduction strategy steps taken by Sanur tourism actors against the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is by having the implementation of the Enforcement of Restrictions on Community Activities (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">PPKM</span><span class="font2">) in Sanur Tourism Area by Denpasar City Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Readiness in this research is a step to reduce the impact of the crisis in Sanur</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">tourism area and to facilitate tourism to run normally again. Based on the results of interviews with the government and tourism institutions in the Sanur tourism area, particularly in terms of disaster management, the government and Sanur tourism institutions do not yet have an SOP in the event of a similar disaster. However, the government and tourism institutions form a network so that this can be a liaison as a coordinating medium. As for other preparedness steps taken by the tourism industry manager, Inna Grand Bali Beach Sanur in reducing the impact and efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in Sanur, by implementing Staff Training &amp;&nbsp;Property Security. Staff Training and Property Security is very important to be applied at the Readiness stage, at this readiness stage it will be seen how the readiness of the management is ready to provide security and comfort guarantees for tourists and staff on duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The response stage is carried out by the management of Inna Grand Bali Beach Sanur where the management complies with and implements the CHSE certification standard. CHSE stands for Cleanliness (cleanliness), Health (health), Safety (security), and Environment Sustainability (environmental sustainability). The government's response in this case is to help hotels and restaurants that are experiencing financial problems due to the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as written in the Denpasar Mayor's Decree 188.45/1105/HK/2020 concerning the application of recipients tourism grants to hotels and restaurants phase I.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Submission of Information on Handling COVID-19 to Visitors and Prospective Visitors</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this research, the effectiveness of implementing the strategy will be seen through the level of achievement in conveying handling information</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/92881-6.jpg" alt="" style="width:207pt;height:86pt;">

<p><span class="font2">From these explanations, it shows that between the government and the actors in the field, they have disseminated information of handling optimally to visitors and potential visitors. The latest</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">information related to the situation in the field not only gives the impression of readiness of the Tourism Destination to accept visitors, it also builds trust for visitors to visit a destination.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Effectiveness of Strategy Implementation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In this research, the effectiveness of implementing strategies by Sanur Tourism Actors will be explained using the concept of sustainable tourism or Sustainable Tourism.
