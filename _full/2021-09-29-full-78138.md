<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract -- </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The covid-19 pandemic has influenced all human life worldwide. This pandemic affects all life in the world, including in Indonesia. Covid-19 had destroyed all aspects of life in Indonesia. One of the most devastating sectors affected is the tourism industry. In order to boost economic sustainability, the Indonesian government, through the Health Ministry, had issued a circular letter no. HK.02.01/MENKES/335/2020 about Protokol Pencegahan Penularan Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) di Tempat Kerja Sektor Jasa dan Perdagangan (Area Publik) dalam Mendukung Keberlangsungan Usaha [Protocol for Prevention of Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) Transmission in the Workplace of the Service and Trade Sector (Public Area) in Supporting Business Continuity]. This study is aimed to investigate the implementation of the Covid-19 protocol as an adaptation of New Normal life in Kuta village, Bali, Indonesia. It is chosen as the research area since Kuta is one of the international tourist destinations in Bali that mostly rely on the tourism industry. The data of this study is taken from any outdoor sign representing New Normal protocol in the area. The documentation method and note-taking technique were applied in collecting the data. The analysis is based on linguistics landscapes theory. The result showed that there are 199 outdoors signs found in 10 groups of most tourism facilities. The language of the sign is dominated by the Indonesian language with 84 signs, followed by the combination of English and Indonesian language with 55 signs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Coronavirus diseases (Covid-19), formerly known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a new strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 that was believed to be transmitted from bat to human (Liu Y-C., et al., 2020; Shareen, 2020). It was labelled as ‘19’ disease since it was initially discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. On March 11<sup>th</sup>, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak as a world pandemic. This status has made Covid-19 the fifth global pandemic since Spanish Flu in 1918, Asian Flu in 157, Hongkong Flu in 1968, and SARS in 2009 (Liu Y-C., et al., 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Covid-19 pandemic has destroyed the world economy because many countries have imposed lockdown regulations or regional quarantines on a national scale by closing all access in and out of the country. Therefore, many companies are closed, including airline companies. This lockdown, of course, has an impact on the world tourism sector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the context of handling this outbreak, the Indonesian government imposed a large-scale social restriction regulation as stipulated in Presidential Regulation number 21/2020 about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar Dalam Rangka Percepatan Penanganan Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) </span><span class="font2">[Large-Scale Social Restrictions in the Context of Accelerating Handling of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Covid-19)]. The issuance of this regulation caused the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vol. 28 No.2</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">paralysis of the economy in Indonesia, especially in the domestic tourism sector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In particular, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on the tourism sector in Bali, whose economy is almost entirely dependent on this sector. Bali has become a dead city, especially seen in the Kuta village area, where almost all hotels, restaurants and souvenir shops are closed due to the absence of foreign and domestic tourists visiting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Responding to these economic problems, the Ministry of Health issued a Circular Letter number HK.02.01/MENKES/335/2020 about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Protokol Pencegahan Penularan Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) di Tempat Kerja Sektor Jasa dan Perdagangan (Area Publik) dalam Mendukung Keberlangsungan Usaha</span><span class="font2"> [Protocol for Prevention of Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) Transmission in the Workplace of the Service and Trade Sector (Public Area) in Supporting Business Continuity].. This circular focuses on adapting a new life protocol (New Normal) in business activities for consumers and workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With the issuance of this circular, tourism activities in Bali, especially in Kuta village, have begun to improve to welcome tourism through the new life protocol (New Normal). The representation of the implementation of this protocol can be seen clearly through various outdoor signs installed/posted in front of business premises and in the business environment, which aim to increase awareness and suppress the spread of Covid-19 in each business environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This study is aimed to investigate the use of the outdoor sign in Kuta as part of New Normal life protocol in conducting their business. Furthermore, it is analysing the use of language in the outdoor signs.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Material and Method</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This study has a very high urgency because the results of this study are expected to provide a definite picture regarding the readiness of the tourism world in Kuta village in welcoming the new normal life protocol for the sustainability of the community's economy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The data sources in this study were all outdoor signs in the village of Kuta. The outdoor signs include traffic signs, government building/office signs, private building/office signs, announcement signs and billboards. In contrast, the population data in this study</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">are various outdoor signs that have a representational relationship related to the new life protocol in the Kuta village area. In this study, the research study area was focused on six main roads in Kuta village, which represented the entire main tourism area in Kuta village. The six roads are Jl. Raya Kuta, Jl. Pantai Kuta, Jl. Legian, Jl. Bakung Sari, Jl. Buni Sari and Jl. Kartika Plaza.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Methods and techniques of data collection in this study using direct documentation techniques from the study area through photographic technique. The data collected is obtained in the Kuta village area, especially in various hotels and restaurants and other public/tourism facilities with a New Normal representation. The data collection was carried out in June 2021 along six main roads in the study area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Methods and techniques of data analysis in this study is a combination of quantitative methods and qualitative methods. The quantitative method is used as a method of quantification analysis and identification of data related to the representation of the language used. The qualitative method is used to explain the analysis in word narration.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical Basis</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Research studies related to outdoor signs known as Linguistic Landscapes (LL) were first initiated by Landry and Bourhis (1997). This study is a derivative form of sociolinguistic studies that discusses communication in society through mass communication which is represented through various signs in public spaces such as various commercial signs, billboards, government building signs, announcement signs and traffic signs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Akindele (2011) discusses LL as a public communication in Gaborone, Botswana. In his article, Akindele tries to examine the influence of LL in the formation and development of the Gabarone Botswana language as a form of language use, linguistic policy among the local community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“ ..... LL can provide valuable insight</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">into the linguistic situation of Gabarone Batswana, including a common pattern of language usage,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vol. 28 No.2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">official language policies, prevalent language attitudes, and the long-term consequences of language contact, among others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ben-Rafael E. et al. (2006) examined the LL in Israel as a symbolic construction in a public place. They analysed the use of the three main languages in Israel in outdoor signs. The results of the study show that the combination of language use in the public domain shows community grouping in the LL environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“... study reveals essentially different</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">LL patterns in Israel's various communities: Hebrew-English signs prevail in Jewish communities;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Arabic-Hebrew in Israeli-Palestinian communities; Arabic-English in East Jerusalem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Huebner (2006) investigated code-mixing and language change in LL in Bangkok. The results of the analysis show that the diversity of language use in the Bangkok metropolitan area has many changes in language use from Chinese to English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“...reveals the extent of linguistic diversity in a large metropolitan area like Bangkok,..... offers evidence of a shift from Chinese to English as the major language....”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The LL research for the Bali area has been previously carried out by Mulyawan. In this study, Mulyawan (2017: 8) focused his analysis on</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">outdoor commercial advertisements in the Kuta area, concluding that the existence of LL in Kuta is a reflection of facility support for the development of the Kuta area as a tourist destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Commercial outdoor sign in Kuta is a reflection of what is needed and vital as the result of global development as a tourist destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The study showed that all Commercial outdoor sign are part of facilities that support the development and sustainability of Kuta as an international tourist destination.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So far, the study of outdoor signs that has been carried out has focused more on linguistic studies related to commercialisation, the strength of language, the influence of power and the status of the language used. The study of multimodality analysis of linguistic landscapes related to the relationship of outdoor signs with the tourism and health sectors has not yet been studied in depth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Result and Discussion</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This study is qualitative research related to the representation of the New Normal adaptation in the world of tourism in Bali, especially in the village of Kuta. This representation is examined through various placements of outdoor signs on various tourism/public facilities. As explained in the research method, the data in this study focused on various New Normal representational signs along six main roads in Kuta village, including Jl. Raya Kuta, Jl. Pantai Kuta, Jl. Legian, Jl. Bakung Sari, Jl. Buni Sari and Jl. Kartika Plaza. The data collection process was carried out for six days, from June 14th, 2021, to June 19th, 2021. Every day, the team collected data on foot along the main road in the study area.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/78138-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:240pt;height:142pt;">
<p><span class="font3">Figure 1. The Current Condition in Kuta</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vol. 28 No.2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A sad fact was obtained in the data collection process, where the conditions along the main road in the study area were still relatively quiet and deserted (see Figure 1). Most hotels, restaurants and various other tourism facilities are still closed and not operating. Likewise, almost no clothing and souvenir shops are open along the main road in Kuta village, especially on Jl. Pantai, Jl. Bakung Sari, Jalan Buni Sari, Jl. Kartika Plaza and Jl. Legian. Slightly different scenery seen on Jl. Raya Kuta (the main traffic lane), which is also the location of Kuta Traditional Market. Along the road, especially along the route to Kuta Traditional Market, economic activity looks quite busy, where almost all the food shops are still open and operating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the results of data collection (see Table 1), 199 outdoor signs were obtained that represent health protocols in the new life order or New Normal. The following are the results of data collection from each of the main roads that are the focus of the study area:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Based on the data collection results, as shown in Table 2 above, the most New Normal signs are found on three main roads: Jl. Kartika Plaza, Jl. Legian and Jl. Pantai Kuta. Those are the centres of entertainment and tourist accommodation. Fifty-three signs (26.63%) were</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">found on Jalan Kartika Plaza, followed by Jalan Legian with 52 signs (26.13%) and Jalan Pantai Kuta with 46 signs (23.11%). Furthermore, the analysis of the New Normal representation on outdoor signs in Kuta village shows that there are 10 groups of New Normal signs based on the location of the signs, which are as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Besides the representation of New Normal signs, this study also analysed the language representations used in various new normal signs in the village of Kuta. Based on the results of the analysis, there are two languages used, namely Indonesian and English. In addition, there are also many visual/non-verbal signs in the form of hand sanitisers, sinks or handwashing facilities without writing in front of each facility location. The results of the analysis found four groups of language combinations used, namely:</span></p>
