<p><span class="font2">also be instrumental in providing sand beach, and the brunt of the waves as a barrier to coastal erosion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Biorock technology is a process of electro mineral deposits that took place in the sea, usually referred as mineral accretion technology. This technology was developed by Prof. Wolf H. Hilbetz a marine scientist from Germany in 1974. Furthermore, since 1988, Prof. Wolf H. Hilbetz with Dr. Thomas J. Goreau (AS), a reef ecologist conducting research to develop longer biorock technologies with a focus on cultivation, maintenance and restoration of coral reefs and coastal protection structures. The scientists research has been done in the world, including Indonesia. Biorock has a structure in the form of low-voltage electrified iron, chemical mekananisme occurs when the electrical flow electrolityc cause a reaction that encourages the formation of natural minerals in sea water, such as calcium carbonate and magnesium hidroxyde. At the same time, electro-chemical changes encourage the growth of organisms around the structure. Consequently, when the coral seed paste on the metal structure, the growth will occur more quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The traces of coral reef restoration in Pemuteran village was started in 1990 by Karang Lestari Fondation.

Chairman of the Foundation chaired by I Gusti Agung Prana secretary I Nyoman Vienna, SH, and Treasurer I Gusti Agung Mantra and Mrs. Rani (a German) (Pitana et al, 2013).</span></p>

The first and most strenuous efforts perceived by a pioneer of environmental leaders who joined the Karang Lestari Foundation is to develop and tranfor the culture of community who crushers ecosystems become the savior of coral reef ecosystems. The approach used by Karang Lestari fondation in the preservation of coral reefs in Pemuteran village is through traditional approaches, cultural, and religious.

In 1996 the growth of coral reefs are naturally good enough that reflects that the work done quite successfully. In fact, corals grow very rich in variety, so some say as one of the locations of the richest coral reefs in the world. Stepping in 2001, a year since the introduction of technology biorock in the village of Pemuteran, Pemuteran Bay area reborn and transformed into a marine park with a rich coral reefs. The growth of coral reefs with biorock technology was able to accelerate the growth of coral reefs three to six times faster and produce coral reefs more resistant to the effects of climate change and contamination of various water pollution, when compared with coral reefs that grow naturally. Marine life is back to normal invited the fish colonies and the coral reefs become it home.</span></p>

Trash on the high seas, if not addressed could lead to a threat to the habitats and marine ecosystems in Pemuteran village.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ease of access and the increasingly short time and distance to Buleleng.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limited access and transport technologies.
