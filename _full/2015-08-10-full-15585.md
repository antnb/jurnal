<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstrak</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pembahasan dalam studi ini mencangkup klasifikasi tipe-tipe atas item-item leksikal dari istilah-istilah budaya Bali sebagai kata utama apabila dimasukkan ke dalam sebuah kamus. Untuk menjelaskan pembahasan tersebut digunakan teori leksikografi yang dikembangkan oleh Atkins dan Rundell (2008). Selain itu, studi ini juga membahas tentang cara-cara yang digunakan dalam membentuk frasa-frasa yang menjelaskan istilah-istilah budaya Bali (eksplikasi) tersebut yang terdapat langsung dalam sumber dat, dimana frasa-frasa ini berada setelah istilah-istilah budaya Bali diletakkan di dalam tanda kurung ataupun mengikuti istilah setelah tanda koma dan garis. Dalam pembahasan ini, teori yang digunakan adalah teori penerjemahan dikembangkan oleh Larson (1998) dikarenakan teori ini merupakan teori yang tepat untuk menjelaskan frasa-frasa tersebut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hasil yang didapat setelah proses analisis data mencangkup dua tipe atas itemitem leksikal dari istilah-istilah budaya bali yang menjadi kata utama apabila dimasukkan ke dalam sebuah kamus yaitu “common word” dan “proper names” sesuai dalam teori yang dikembangakan oleh Atkins dan Rundell (2008). Selain itu, cara-cara yang digunakan untuk membetuk frasa-frasa yang menjelaskan istilah-istilah budaya Bali (eksplikasi) adalah dengan memodifikasi sebuah kata umum, dimodifikasi dari segi bentuk, pernyataan tentang fungsi dan mencangkup keduanya antara bentuk dan fungsi. Cara lainnya adalah “cultural substitute” sesuai teori penerjemahan yang dikembangkan oleh Larson (1998).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kata kunci : istilah-istilah budaya Bali, tipe-tipe atas item-item leksikal, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">eksplikasi</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of the Study</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Bali as a tourism destination offers its unique culture including way of life, customs, beliefs, as well as the language to attract people from all over the world to come visiting Bali. The people who come definitely want to get much information about Balinese culture in which it can be conducted by searching on the internet, reading newspapers, magazines and so forth. In those media, particular terms whose concepts are unknown in English exist. These terms belong to Balinese culture known as Balinese cultural terms. When the terms could not be understood by the reader, it is appropriate to provide the meaning of the terms. Simply, consulting dictionary is also the best way to find the meaning</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of the terms. This study is conducted to identify and classify Balinese cultural terms according to their types as the headwords when presented in dictionary. Further, in case of the meaning of the terms through explications are also important to be considered whether it uses particular ways in establishing those explications.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">There are two problems of this study formulated here which are related to each other, as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What types of lexical items of Balinese cultural terms are found in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bali Daily newspaper</span><span class="font1">?, and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What ways are used in establishing the explications of Balinese cultural terms in English?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aims</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Related to the problems mentioned previously, the aims of the study are formulated as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To identify and classify the types of lexical items of Balinese cultural terms found in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bali Daily</span><span class="font1"> newspaper, and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To analyze and explain the ways used in establishing the explications of Balinese cultural terms in English.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The data in this study were taken from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bali Daily</span><span class="font1"> newspaper that is an English newspaper as one of the editions of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Jakarta Post</span><span class="font1"> founded by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">PT Bina Media Tenggara</span><span class="font1">. In the newspaper, there are many Balinese cultural terms followed by the explications in bracket and after the coma. The data were found in 18 published newspapers in January, February and March 2014. The data were collected by library research through documentation method using reading and note taking technique. Besides, the data were analyzed by qualitative method in which the data were elaborated descriptively. Since this is a study of lexicography, the data were analyzed according to alphabetical order in which the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">data is structured from letter “A” to “letter “Z”. From the data source, it was found some Balinese cultural terms in letter “B”, letter “C”, letter “J”, letter “P” and letter “T”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Result and Discussion</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">According to the theory of lexicography developed by Atkins and Rundell (2008), there are two types of lexical items which become the headwords presented in dictionary in which both of the types are indicated through the data. The types are labelled as “common words” and “proper names”. In term of common word, there are three aspects to be considered, they are word class, lexical form including variant forms, variant spelling, inflections, and derived form, and lexical structure including simple words, abbreviation and contractions, partial words, multiword expression consists of transparent collocations, fixed and semi-fixed phrase and other phrasal idioms with the additional compounds and phrasal verbs. Whereas, the second type is proper names including place names, personal names and other names.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The theory of translation developed by Larson (1998), which is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lexical Equivalents when Concepts are Unknown,</span><span class="font1"> reveals that there are three ways used to establish the lexical equivalents of terms of concepts are known due to difference of culture, world view, geography, and so on. The ways are; first is “equivalence by modifying a generic word” with four modifications, they are “modified with feature of form”, modified with a statement of function”, modified with both form and function”, and “modified by a comparison”. The second way is “equivalence by modifying a loan word” with two modifications, those are “modified by a classifier” and “modified with a description of form, function, or both”. The third way is “equivalence by cultural substitute” which uses a certain word in the receptor language that is not exactly the same however it occurs in the receptor culture.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Analysis description:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The term “bhuta kala” is one of Balinese cultural terms related to religious belief. The term “bhuta kala” comes from Sanskrit that is composed of two words; “bhuta” which means “part of body that is the gross one” and “kala” which means “time”. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bhuta kala</span><span class="font1"> can be said as the evil spirits that can make human getting many problems in life. However, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bhuta kala</span><span class="font1"> can also be controlled by various kinds of rituals and offerings (Bali: Sekala &amp;&nbsp;Niskala, 1990:227). In term of lexical item, the word “bhuta kala” can be categorized as common word which according to Quirk (1985) about the subclasses of noun, it is classified as abstract mass noun because it is a thing that is not observable and the number cannot be counted. It is a compound word from “bhuta” and “kala.” The way used in establishing the explication is by modifying a generic word and modified with feature of form. The generic word is “beings” and the feature of form is indicated by the phrase “supernatural and often malevolent”. This means that it is a being in form of supernatural and malevolent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The term “canang” is a Balinese cultural term related to religious object. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Canang</span><span class="font1"> is a kind of offerings. It is the simplest offering used by Balinese people to do worship daily. The form of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">canang</span><span class="font1"> is beautiful with various colorful flowers. The most basic form of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">canang</span><span class="font1"> is in square shape, the hole in bottom is filled in with banana leaf. After resembling such a container, it is filled by colored leaves, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">porosan</span><span class="font1"> and various kinds of flowers representing five directions of gods (Bali: Sekala &amp;&nbsp;Niskala, 1990:219). The term “canang” as the lexical item can be categorized as common word, specifically simple word. According to Quirk (1985) about the subclasses of noun, it is classified as concrete countable noun because the form of “canang” is observable and it is a thing easily to be counted. The explication is established by modifying a generic word and modified with a statement of function. “Offerings” indicates the generic words, while “spiritual” is the statement of function. It means that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">canang</span><span class="font1"> is offerings for spiritual purpose.</span></p>

According to Quirk (1985) about the subclasses of noun, it is classified as concrete countable noun since the form of “pecalang” is observable and it is a thing that can easily be counted. The explication of this term is established by modifying a generic word that is “guards” and modified with both form which is indicated by phrase “traditional Balinese” and function, signified by word “safety.” This means that the guard is in form of traditionally a Balinese guard purposed for safety.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Analysis description:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The term “Tri Hita Karana” is one of Balinese cultural term related to Hindu belief. This is a philosophy that lives in the way of thinking of Hindu people particularly in Bali. This term is composed of three words; “tri” means three, “hita” means cause and “karana” means the harmonious relationship, therefore </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Hita Karana</span><span class="font1"> means three causes for the harmonious relationship between living creatures. The relationships are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Parhyangan</span><span class="font1"> (the relationships between human and God), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pawongan</span><span class="font1"> (the relationships between human and other humans) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">palemahan</span><span class="font1"> (the relationships between human and its surroundings). It becomes lexical item that is categorized as proper name classified as the part of belief. The explication of this term is established by modifying a generic word “philosophy” modified with both form that is “the Balinese Hindu” and function which is indicated by phrase “that embodies the belief that physical and spiritual wellbeing is achieved through a balanced existence.” This means that the philosophy is in the form of Balinese Hindu philosophy whose function is embodies the belief that physical and spiritual well-beings is achieved through a balance existence.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">According to the analysis data, it can be concluded that, the data that is the lexical items as the headword when presented in dictionary can be divided into</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">two types; they are common words and proper names including part of belief and semi-historical personal name. From the data in the classification of common words, most of the data are classified as noun; variously from abstract to concrete noun and from count to mass noun. In the lexical form of the data, there are some data that are derived form such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pecalang.</span><span class="font1"> And the lexical structure indicated by the data is simple words and compounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides, the data in establishing the explications uses the first way which is modifying a generic word, with three modifications, which are; modified with feature of form, modified with a statement of function, and modified with both form and function. None of the data uses the second way that is modifying a loan word. Yet, the third way of establishing the explications of Balinese cultural terms by cultural substitute is also applied.</span></p>
