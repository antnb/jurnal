<p><span class="font3">As one of the most popular destinations for international tourists, Bali has attracted a sizeable and growing labor force in the tourism sector of the economy. This fact has triggered Balinese labor force to participate in such service industry. As a supplier of tourism labor force Bali has been increasingly successful in promoting the number of workers to be employed on cruise ships. The participation rate of Balinese women in cruise industry over the last four years has dramatically increased. The Balinese womenâ€™s participation in cruise ship employment has brought major implications for their life and culture. Generally, the present study aimed to provide an overview of Balinese women employed on board of a cruise ship. More specifically, it examined (1) the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats faced by Balinese women working in cruise industry, (2) factors influencing them to work in the industry, and (3) the implications brought by such employment for their life and society. The present study used quantitative and qualitative data collected through economic, social, and cultural approach. The sample was comprised of 200 respondents selected using accidental sampling method. To answer the research questions, data collection was conducted through observation, interviews, as well as focus group discussion (FGD). The data on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats faced by Balinese women on board of a cruise ship were analyzed using SWOT analysis, whereas the data on the factors influencing them to work in the cruise industry were analyzed using factor analysis. Finally, qualitative analysis was employed to analyze the data on the economic, social, and cultural implications for their life. The analysis showed that: (1) Balinese women were employed on board of a cruise linerpredominantly as support staff. The strengths of Balinese women cruise ship workers included being friendly, always smiling, being honest, being loyal, being responsible, and being highly skilled. Their weaknesses included having low motivation to get a high position, having low English proficiency level, and having insufficient self-confidence. The job opportunities were still high since women were generally reluctant to work in the cruise industry. The threats they faced included the lack of concern on the part of the government, agents providing poor services and unjustly treating applicants. (2) The factors influencing Balinese women to work in the cruise industry were of economic, social, and cultural. (3) The implications brought by the cruise ship employment for Balinese women were divided into three: economic implication, social implication, and cultural implication. Economic implication refers to their ability to help increase their family income. (b) Social implication refers to the fact that through employment in the cruise industry they could elevate their and their family social status. (3) cultural implication refers to their contribution to the preservation of their own culture (i.e. Balinese culture).</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Introduction</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Background</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Working in a cruise ship is a trend today for the people of Bali. Balinese people have seen the fact that workers who work in the cruise ships have changed their standard of living and that of their families. This is evidenced by the fact that working in a cruise ship, they could meet their primary, secondary and tertiary needs more feasibly by building a more permanent home or buying a car. They realize that working in a cruise ship in addition to getting greater income than working in home country, they can travel out of the country, and are able to open their horizons. This fact motivates other Balinese workforce to be able to also work in cruise ships. This is in line with the research by Sunarsa (2010) which states that working in cruise ships has a promising prospect as long as they are able to do it because the salary received is greater than working in home country. However, lately there have been some cases causing concerns that struck Balinese workers who work in cruise ships such as the cases of abuse and rape, as well as the death of a Balinese labor while working in a cruise ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bali as a tourism workforce producer has managed to increase the sending of Bali labors to cruises in 2010-2013. In terms of percentage, the level of participation of Balinese women who work in the cruise tourism industry from year to year has increased, although the level of participation is still less than 10%, when compared to the male workforce (BP3TKI, 2014). Balinese women's involvement in the cruise tourism industry certainly gives implications to the advancement of tourism and environment of life both in terms of economy, social, and culture. The involvement of women in the cruise ship industry is an interesting phenomenon, because generally this tourism sector belongs to the male domain. The participation of Balinese women to work in the cruise tourism industry is influenced by social and economic factors. Social factors include age group, marital status, and education. Economic factors that can affect the motivation of women to work in the cruise tourism industry, for example, among others are due to the fact that women are forced to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">work out of economic necessities of their families or they want to help their husbands to supplement the family income. Even with the success of the family in achieving economic establishment of the family can cause the exit of women from the field of employment (Soedjono, 1986).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Empowerment of women in the cruise tourism industry is an interesting case because culturally tourism sector is in the public sector, which is based on the traditional division of labor (gender) a public sector is male-domain working area. The working area of women is in domestic sectors such as managing the household, washing, and cooking. Sukeni (2006) stated that although there is division of labor in the conventional way, but in reality especially for women, Bali is a lot different because since modern tourism is developed in Bali, Balinese women have participated in the public sector, such as working in the tourism industry. It is therefore interesting to study in depth about the implications of Balinese women who work in the cruise tourism industry to the environment in terms of economy, social, and culture.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Research Objectives</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">In general, this study aimed to give a general idea of the existence of Balinese women who work in the cruise tourism industry. Specifically, the purposes of this research are to:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assess the presence of Balinese women who work in the cruise tourism industry from the aspects of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats they face,</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assess the economic, social, and cultural implications of Balinese women who work in the cruise tourism industry to tourism and life environment.</span></p></li></ul>
<h1><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Literature Review</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Balinese women's studies in the cruise ship industry interesting to discuss because of the involvement of women in the tourism sector is influenced by economic, social, and cultural factors. Several studies related to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">issues discussed in the study include: Wilkinson and Pratiwi (1995) entitled &quot;Gender and Tourism in an Indonesian Village&quot;; Kalpika (1999), entitled &quot;Women in Tourism Industry: A Case Study in the tourism area of Kuta, Ubud and Kintamani&quot; explained that tourism has shifted the pattern of household labor in society Kuta, Ubud and Kintamani; Sari (2008), entitled Motivation of Balinese Women Workers in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Melati</span><span class="font3"> Hotels in Ubud Tourism Area, Gianyar, Bali which examine the motivation of Balinese female workers working on jasmine hotels, as well as the influence of age, education, household income, marital status, asset ownership and working conditions of the motivation Balinese women in melati hotels in Ubud tourism area; as well as in research by Sadia and Oka (2012) entitled &quot;Working motivation of Balinese workforce working in Mediterranean Shipping Company Cruise&quot; it is argued that the working motivation of Balinese workforce to work in Mediterranean Shipping Company Cruise is dominant because of the economic motivation amounting to 91.58%, while the non-economic motivation is equal to 8.42%. In details, it is mentioned that labor Bali working in Mediterranean Shipping Company Cruise for reasons of family economic necessity of 72.79%, to increase family income amounting to 15.79%, to improve the self social status and family 6.32%, and they work to continue their hobbies amounting to 2.11%.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Concepts</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">In assessing the existence of Balinese women in the cruise tourism industry, it describes some of the concepts related to the research namely tourism industry, cruise ships (floating hotel), gender equality, and Balinese women.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Tourism Industry</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The understanding of tourism industry in this study is a collection of diverse companies, either directly or indirectly required by tourists during travel. Companies that include the tourism industry, according to Leiper (in Pitana and Diarta, 2009: 63-65) consists of seven sectors, namely the marketing sector, transportation sector (the carrier sector), the accommodation sector, the attraction sector, the tour operator sector, the miscellaneous sector, and the coordinator sector.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Cruise (Floating Hotel)</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Cruise ship (floating hotel) is a property that uses boat/ship which is commercially managed, providing facilities and lodging services, eating and drinking, as well as other services for tourists who stay within a certain period. Cruise is a luxury hotel that can be found in the sea / ocean, which is often referred to as a cruiser or a floating hotel. Perwani (1993) states that floating hotel is a form of accommodation that is contained in the local river, canal or ocean with special characteristics, such as using boats or ships that sail from one place to another, and have a certain number of guests during the trip which has been specified. (Bagyono, 2012). mentions cruise ship (marine hotel) is a floating hotel providing room facilities, restaurants and bars which are similar to five-star hotels.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Gender Equality</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Gender equality in the context of tourism is to achieve justice and equality dimension role in everyday life between women and men in the cruise tourism industry in positions, wages and others. The concept of gender is different from sex which refers to the difference between the sexes, which in turn makes the natural differences between men and women, based on their gender, universally applicable and cannot be changed. But the division of labor between men and women in society is not determined by biological factors, but rather constructed by social and cultural factors, namely power relations that are hereditarily maintained by men. These values define the roles of women and men in private life and areas of life in community (Marhumah, 2012).</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Balinese Women</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Balinese women in this study were women of Hindu Balinese ethnics who used to work/are still working in the cruise tourism industry. They now continue to fight for justice and role equality in everyday dimension of life in the field of tourism. Triguna (2011) states that the struggle for justice and role equality in the field of tourism is a challenge for Bali Hindu women in the future. Arniati (2012) refers to injustice in the social structure, and then manifested through</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">economic, social, political and cultural life of the society. Injustice suffered by women in society ultimately stimulates the birth of emancipatory movements, hereinafter referred to as feminism movement.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Theory of Motivation</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Motivation is the result of processes that are internal or external to an individual who raises enthusiastic attitude and persistence to follow the direction of certain actions. Factors in a person can be in the form of personality, attitude, experience and education or the expectations / aspirations that reach out into the future. Factors outside a person may include their neighborhood (Winardi, 2001). Maslow (1943) states that job needs and satisfactions are synonymous with biological and psychological needs, in the form of material and non-material. The basic theory is that humans are creatures who have unlimited or endless desires. The motivation tool is the unfulfiled satisfaction and tiered needs, these levels can be drawn from the lowest to the highest needs, namely: (1) physiological needs; (2) safety needs; (3) Social needs; (4) the need for respect (esteem needs); and (5) heightening the need for self-actualization (self actualization needs).</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Theory of Feminism</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Feminism according to various scholars is a theory that aims to fight for women to gain their rights in accordance with their functions in modern society, especially in the field of tourism. Feminist theory according to Ritzer and Goodman (2012: 403-404) is a generalization of the various systems of ideas about social life and human experience developed from the perspective centered on women. Feminist theory is developed by critical thinkers of activists or â€˜fightersâ€™ for the sake of women who tried to create a better life for women, hence according to critical thinkers, the struggle is for humanity.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Theory of Deconstruction</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Experts claim that deconstruction is a theory that leads to humans that there is no absolute or eternal truth, the truth will be amended in accordance with circumstances and changing times. Derrida (in Lubis, 2006)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">through deconstruction is looking for basis of a truth in accordance with the circumstances that occurred in people's lives. Derrida is posmodernist &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hard &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liner, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;strong</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">posmodernist&quot;, who is trying to overhaul the modern world view of meaning, truth, knowledge and language in a novel way. With regard to the concept of deconstruction, Derrida (in Sutrisno and Putranto, 2005) once again makes changes to something that he can produce himself; something that is not just taking from what is already available from a tradition of thought to be criticized. To fight arbitrariness way of thinking that has always tried to find the single meaning of a text, Derrida argues that the concept of thought as a starting point of thought and effort to think of modern times should be changed totally, destroyed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deconstructed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">deconstruction of the thought building brings a new nuance.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Theory of Strategic Planning</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Strategic planning is planning a business strategy to cope with the possibility of external threats and seize every existing opportunity. Strategic planning is done so that the tourism operators can see objectively the internal and external conditions, so that managers can anticipate changes in the external environment. Rangkuti (1998) states the analysis of strategic planning is one of the subject areas studied seriously in the academic field. This is done because every time there is a change. These changes can be seen from the increasingly tight competition, increasingly sophisticated technological changes, and changes in demographic conditions, which result in changes in consumer tastes rapidly. A good understanding of the concept of strategy and other related concepts largely determine the success of the strategy developed by the company (David, 2011). These concepts include: &nbsp;&nbsp;(1) distinctive</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">competence: actions taken by the managers of tourism in order to perform the activities better than their competitors, (2) competitive advantage: the specific activities developed by tourism operators to be more superior compared to their competitors.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Research Model</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The research model used in to discuss the presence of Balinese women in the cruise tourism industry is sketched in Figure 1.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Methodology</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Research Location</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The research location was Bali province, the research subjects were women who used to or were still working in the cruise tourism industry.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Type and Source of Data</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Type of data collected in this study is quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data is data that is in the form of figures such as data on the number of migrant workers of Bali Province, migrant workers who work in the cruise tourism industry as well as other related data. Qualitative data are obtained under a variety of information from respondents stated in the research dimension as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of Balinese women, as well as economic, social, and cultural factors that affect the motivations of Balinese women to work in a cruise ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The data sources used are primary sources and secondary sources. From the primary sources, secondary data is obtained, that is, the data obtained from the first source is used as a sample, such as data resulting from the questionnaire about the respondents. Then, the results of the tabulated data would be displayed in tabular format. From secondary sources, secondary data was obtained, that is, the data was obtained from the competent authority such as Disparda Bali, BPS, and BP3TKI Bali which were related to the research topic.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Data Collection Methods</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Methods of data collection conducted in the research were: observation, interviews, documentation, and FGD.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Population and Sample Research</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">To examine the factors that motivate women Bali to work in cruise tourism industry used factor analysis. The total sample was 200 women respondents out of a population of women who work in the cruise tourism industry in 2013 totaling 901 people. Determination of the number of samples used Solimun (2002) who revealed that the sample which is eligible to study through the analysis of factors is minimally as many as five times the number of variables. This study uses 21 variables of study, to be more representative, the sample of 200 respondents was used. Kusmayadi (2000) said that in making the number of samples studied, the accidental sampling method is used, that is, the respondents asked for information are completely encountered by chance when doing research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In assessing the existence of Balinese woman, it is seen from the aspect of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats faced and the economic, social, and cultural implications in the cruise tourism industry in tourism and environment of life in depth, informants whose amount are not completely specified will be sought. The data collection began from one of the women having got the experience of working on a cruise ship and then spread to the other women. Data collection was considered sufficient after the information / data obtained was saturated. According to Nasution (2003), initially, the indepth study does not specify the number of informants. Selection of informants was initially done purposively, and then it was selected by means of snowball technique.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Types and Variable Measurement</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Determination of variables is important to do. These research variables can describe the problems to be addressed in the object of research. Variable serves as a differentiator in order to clear in each item under study and also serves to illustrate the interconnections or have a relationship between one variable and other variables and give an overview of aligned relationship with the theory used, in this case, the theory of factors motivating Balinese women to work in the cruise tourism industry. Variables motivating Balinese women working in the cruise tourism industry are classified into three categories: economic factors as many as 7 variables (X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7), social factors 7 variables (X8, X9, X10, X11, X12, X13, X14), and cultural factors 7 variables (X15, X16, X17, X18, x19, X20, X21).</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Data Analysis</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Descriptive Analysis</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">To assess Balinese women who work in the cruise tourism industry from the aspects of the position of women working in the cruise tourism industry used descriptive statistical analysis. The position of Balinese women who work in the cruise tourism industry is described descriptively in the form of tables. Description of the levels of management positions in the industry according to Fayol (in Handayaningrat, 1990). consists of crew</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">positions, lower manager, midle manager, and top manager. The data obtained were then described systematically with the aim of making it easier to understand Balinese women who work in the cruise tourism industry.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Analysis of Factors</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">In analyzing the problems of the factors that motivate Balinese women working in cruise tourism industry, the research model has been described, that is, the analysis used for this study employs confirmatory factor analysis. The use of confirmatory factor analysis aims to confirm the factors that motivate Balinese women working in cruise tourism industry in terms of economic, social and cultural aspects. In the data analysis a constructs model framework described in Figure 3.1 is expressed in an equation through factor analysis process by following a few stages as disclosed by Solimun (2002) as follows:</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Formulation of the problem to be a model</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Making the correlation matrix. To see whether or not there is a correlation, then do some testing among others Test Kaiser Meyer Olkin (KMO) to determine the the adequacy of the sample or measuring sample feasibility. Analysis of the factors is considered feasible if the amount of KMO&gt; 0.05 and Barlett's test of Spericity used to test that the variables in the sample vary. Determining the accuracy of the model. Preparation of a variable is based on the results of the process on the correlation matrix above. From the results of the matrix it will appear related variables based on root characteristic (eigen value) owned. Factors that will be considered significant when eigen value of the factor is more than one (Î»&gt; = 0,600). Interpretation of factors. At this stage, it is performed by grouping variables that have a loading factor (correlation between variables and the factors that shaped) high into the factor. For the interpretation of the factors in this study were assigned loading factor is minimally 0.05. Variables that have a loading factor of less than 0.05 will be excluded from this model because it has no effect on these factors. Results of the data test are then analyzed using factor analysis. Factor analysis used in this study is confirmatory factor</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">analysis. As revealed by Solimun (2002) that the confirmatory factor analysis is a priori based on theories and concepts that have been made against some of the factors that will be established, as well as latent variables included in these factors.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Qualitative Analysis</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">In analyzing the data of economic, social, and cultural implications of Balinese women who work in the cruise tourism industry in the environment of life, it is done through the processing and interpretation of the data which is a series of periodic review, grouping, systematization, interpretation and reification of data so that a phenomenon has social academic and scientific value. The data analysis step according to Suprayogo (2001) is an entity that is intertwined at the time before, during and after the collection of data in a form that should be to establish a general insight called &quot;analysis&quot;. The data analysis was conducted to find the hidden reasons behind the actions of the perpetrators of social action or geared towards social significance (social meaning) of social phenomena. The focus is to find what kind of mindset that glows behind a social phenomenon or to find the rationality that lies behind the social phenomena (Bungin, 2001).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In assessing the opportunities and threats faced by women Bali in cruises, they are analyzed using SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis. Referring to Rangkuti (1998), SWOT analysis is a way to identify the various factors systematically in order to formulate the company's strategy. This analysis based on logic can maximize the strengths and opportunities, but can simultaneously minimize the weaknesses and threats. SWOT analysis considers and compares between external factors, in the form of opportunities and threats to internal factors, such as the strengths and weaknesses, so that the results of the analysis can take a strategic decision in the empowerment of women in the cruise tourism industry.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Presentation of Results of Data Analysis Techniques</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The results of data analysis used in this study combine formal and informal methods. Formal data obtained will be presented either in the form of tables, graphs, or photographs. Informal data will be presented in the form of a narrative or description.

<p><span class="font3">women workers, among others: labor protection is still less from the government, the labor agencies seem to work like civil servants who tend to lack in services involving TKI documents, and the agencies often provide the unfair treatment of workers who want to work on a cruise ship.</span></p>
