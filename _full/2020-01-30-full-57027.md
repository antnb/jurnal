<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract*</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">This study concerns with the use of Appraisal Theory developed by Martin &amp;&nbsp;White (2005), under subsumed of engagement system domain. The engagement system deals with dialogic perspective between speakers and listeners, which is influenced by the approach of Bakhtin/ Voloshinov, called heteroglossia. Heteroglossic backdrop reveals the proposition lies behind what is stated. In this study, a verbal interaction between speaker and listener is presented in the form of press conference release. Currently serving Head Commissioner of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Filippo Grandi, held a press conference release containing of his visiting report to the camp shelter of Rohingya refugee in Bangladesh. The press conference release is a recorded-video type one, which has approximately 27:30” in length. It is led by a moderator, reported by the Head Commissioner and joined by 6 followup questions. Regarding to engagement system used, the utterances are then transcribed into a transcript, thus it gains approximately 395 clauses, moreover, only the utterances spoken by the Head Commissioner taken as the engagement locution realizations. The objectives of this research fall into three: a) to find out the most predominant heteroglossic backdrop Grandi encodes; b) to recognize the values and viewpoint Grandi intends to convey in his report; and c) to identify the authorial voice Grandi uses in addressing his beliefs of the Rohingya refugee crisis to the audiences. The qualitative descriptive method is applied. It is found that contract-disclaim-counter dominates the report by accounts of 55 realizations. It implies that the facts, Grandi reports may against audiences’ expectation, yet in another clause, he describes the situation which can reform audiences’ different viewpoints toward the crisis.</span><span class="font2">)</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The world’s eyes must have been confronted to the fact that persecution of certain tribes and ethnical violence remain to happen. Indeed, the modern colonization is still there in several parts of earth. Thus, the people who suffer from the colonization keep on trying to flee and find safer shelter for themselves. Therefore, the refugee issues emerge day by day. The issues could never be stopped as long as injustice humanity problems and wars remain to happen. One of the ongoing issues comes up from Rohingya refugee, a group of people who originates from the northern area of Rakhine state, Myanmar. The Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic minority group in Rakhine, are considered among the most persecuted, vulnerable, and oppressed minorities in the world. Recently, the persecution on the Rohingya Muslims has increased due to Buddhist nationalism in Myanmar. They are victims of various forms of oppression, such as arbitrary taxation, land confiscation, destruction of mosques, torture and ill-treatment, extrajudicial executions, restrictions on movements, forced eviction and house destruction, forced laborers on roads and at military camps, and financial restrictions on marriage (Mohajan, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Buddhists of Myanmar claim that the Rohingya are economically developed, and their culture is under siege than the Rohingya. The Rohingya are confronted with a deeply entrenched Islam phobia with Rakhine in Myanmar. Myanmar is surrounded by some Islamic countries, such as Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The Buddhists think that if any Islamic country attacks Myanmar, the Rohingya will fight against Myanmar..Therefore, they are culturally discriminated, economically exploited, and politically sidelined by the Government of Myanmar (GoM) (Wolf, 2017).The oppression of the Rohingya people resulted in repeated population movements within Myanmar and to other countries, culminating in the mass displacement of Rohingya to Bangladesh in the second half of 2017. In August 2017, a major humanitarian crisis in the Rakhine State of Myanmar triggered a mass exodus of around three-quarters of a million stateless Rohingya refugees into neighboring Bangladesh, adding to the estimated 200,000–300,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh who had fled Myanmar earlier and the estimated 73,000 Rohingya refugees in Malaysia (UNHCR, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning this matter, United Nations, under the role of the United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has taken its parts in controlling and organizing the issues of refugee as well. Filippo Grandi, who currently serves as the 11<sup>th</sup> United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, elected by the UN General Assembly on 1 January 2016 to serve a five-year term, until 31 December 2020. He has been engaged in refugee and humanitarian work for more than 30 years. Grandi holds a degree in modern history from the State University in Milan, a BA in Philosophy from the Gregorian University in Rome and an honorary doctorate from the University of Coventry (UNHCR, 2016). Therefore, there is no doubt anymore in his dedication for humanitarian work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The mandates which Grandi holds, allow him to be responsible of any existing refugee issues. Along with his boards in UNHCR, Grandi have always been projected to the enormous number of refugee issues and what comes up within it. In line with the Rohingya refugee issue, UNHCR has taken its role as well. Moreover, Grandi’s visit to Bangladesh back in the day has been being worlds’ center of attention. For his report of visit becomes the awaited news of world citizen. Why is it awaited? The question has come to appear. Definitely, the world citizen needs to hear about the condition and status of Rohingya refugee directly from the Head of UNHCR. As the information of it, from him, considerably is the most accurate and factual rather than the issues spread out there in the society, which doesn’t expose valid report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As any colleagues of his in UN boards have done after visiting a refugee site, Grandi also reports his observation by holding a press conference at the headquarters of UNHCR in Geneva.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the view that whenever speakers or writers say anything, they encode their point of view towards it (Stubbs, 1996).Therefore, Grandi delivers, obviously could influence people’s point of view towards the Ronghiya refugee issue. His interpersonal style of speaking such as; the way he delivers speech, the way he reports his observation, the way he elaborates the condition of Rohingya refugee, the way he describes the camp site situation in Bangladesh, the way he responses to the follow-up questions, and which diction he uses rather than the others, they are being essential entities analyzed in this study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Analyzing interpersonal style is the workplace of Systemic Functional Linguistic (Halliday and Matthiessen, 1994/2004), but in way more specific functions, called Appraisal Theory. Appraisal is realized as discourse semantic since it emphasizes the meaning beyond the clause. As a tool of language of evaluation, appraisal, by presenting the material, reveals the speaker/writer negotiation of feelings and values to whom they communicate (Dinamika, 2016).Martin &amp;&nbsp;White in 2005 has developed appraisal theory as one of the extension of interpersonal systems at the level of discourse semantics, besides negotiation and involvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Appraisal deals with three major domains, namely ‘attitude’, ’engagement’, and ‘graduation’. Attitude plays its role in concerning emotional reactions and evaluation of things. Then, engagement construes the play of voices around opinions in discourse. Meanwhile, graduation deals with grading phenomena (Martin and White, 2005).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several studies on appraisal under subsumed of engagement system done within written form as the sources. It implicates that it hasn’t completely reflected Voloshinov’s ideas which states that verbal communication is the basic reality of language (Voloshinov, 1995). Depart from that ideas, for Grandi’s report on Rohingya refugee in Bangladesh released in a recorded press conference, therefore, in this study, the engagement one is the most appropriate resource applied, asit construes the “dialogic perspective”. By analyzing Grandi’s report using engagement evaluation, it, perhaps, can be figure out, in which position Grandi takes stances and in which value or belief he intends to convey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus, this study engages to explore the engagement system found in Filippo Grandi’s press conference report on Rohingya Refugee in Bangladesh camp shelter. Moreover, the objectives of this study fall into three: a) to find out the most predominant heteroglossic backdrop Grandi encodes; b) to recognize the values and viewpoint Grandi intends to convey in his report;and c) to identify the authorial voice Grandi uses in addressing his beliefs of the Rohingya refugee crisis to the audiences.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">A recorded press conference video release of Filippo Grandi – UNHCR Head Commissioner, entitled “Rohingya Refugee Emergency in Bangladesh, Geneva, 27/09/2017” is accessible on United Nation official webpage, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">please visit</span><span class="font3"> </span><a href="http://webtv.un.org/watch/filippo-grandi-unhcr-press-conference-rohingya-refugee-"><span class="font3">(</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">http://webtv.un.org/watch/filippo-grandi-unhcr-</span></a><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"></span><a href="http://webtv.un.org/watch/filippo-grandi-unhcr-press-conference-rohingya-refugee-"><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">press-conference-rohingya-refugee</span><span class="font3">)</span></a><span class="font3">. Length of the video is approximately 27 minutes and 30 seconds. The press conference is led by a moderator, reported by Filippo Grandi – the UNHCR Head commissioner as the keynote speaker, and followed by six follow-up questions which come up from the audiences in that press conference room. Moreover only the utterances uttered by Filippo Grandi taken as the data. The oral utterances are transcribed into text form, in order to easier the process of analysis, without omitting even a word he utters, which then obtaining approximately 395 clauses.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/57027-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:194pt;height:109pt;">

<p><span class="font3">Qualitative descriptive method is applied due to its necessity to explore the engagement ‘realization locutions’ found in the transcribed report and to describe or to categorize the types and subtypes of the locution. There is also a quantification applied, but, it’s by means of, counting the distributions and frequencies of each subtype.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Literature Review</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">In these recent years, numbers of research on appraisal have been done to prove that the language of evaluation existing in the form of written and spoken language. Any languages and its form of language can be evaluated or even analyzed through the occurrence of this theory, called appraisal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 2006, a study on evaluation of engagement in journalistic and news reportage in two languages, English and Spanish has been held by Arrese and Perucha. The student found that the presence and patterning of the various linguistic resources for the expression of evaluation in these subgenres of journalistic discourse, establishes comparisons across languages (Arrese and Perucha, 2006). Meanwhile, Zhang (2015) examines the appraisal resources of two earthquake reports from China Daily – China’s most influential national English newspaper, in 1998 about Shangyi earthquake and 2008 about Wenchuan earthquake. Then, it is found that there are great changes in disaster reporting within over 10 years. The changes between attitudinal and engagement research implicate a development in the disaster reports of China daily, which also influence the reader’s feeling and viewpoint of the disaster reports (Zhang, 2015).</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Engagement in Appraisal Theory</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Under subsumed of appraisal theory as described in Martin &amp;&nbsp;White (2005), engagement system concerns with the means for the authorial voice to position itself with respect to, and hence to ‘engage’ with, the other voices and alternative positions construed as being in play in the current communicative context (Martin and White, 2005).Engagement is much influenced by dialogic perspective informed by the Bakhtin’s/Voloshinov’s notion of dialogism and heteroglossia. In which they state that all verbal communication, whether written or spoken, is ‘dialogic’ in that to speak or to write is always to reveal the influence of, refer to, or take up in some way, what has been said/written before, and simultaneously to anticipate the responses of actual, potential or imagined readers/ listeners (Bakhtin, 1981; Voloshinov, 1995).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Engagement system takes account of dialogic perspective which then falls into two types of communicative environment or in other terms called dialogistic status, namely monoglossic and heteroglossic. ‘Monogloss’ uses categorical assertions to build shared values with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">receiver by presenting an idea as being commonsense and having no alternative. ‘Heterogloss’, by contrast, acknowledges the possibility of alternative viewpoints, responses and/or truth values. Heterogloss itself may be either ‘dialogically expansive’ (opening up to other voices) or ‘dialogically contractive’ (restricting possible responses) (Munday, 2015). In other words, utterances are considered to be categorized as monoglossic when they make no reference to other voices and viewpoints. Meanwhile, when they do invoke or allow for dialogic alternatives, categorized as heteroglossic. As stated in Martin &amp;&nbsp;White (2005) that category of engagement construes for the text a heteroglossic backdrop of prior utterances, alternative viewpoints and anticipated responses, thus, this study will only focus on outlining the heteroglossic resource. It can be divided into two broad categories – dialogic contraction and dialogic expansion.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Heteroglossic: dialogic contraction</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Dialogic contraction acts to contract the dialogic space rather than to open it up. Its contractive meanings fall into two categories as followings;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclaim – voice position of rejecting, supplanting or some contrary position. It is then subtyped into disclaim ‘deny (negation)’ and disclaim ‘counter’. Deny is realized in such locutions, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">no, not, never, nothing, wrong</span><span class="font3"> and any other denial words. While, counter is conveyed by conjunctions such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">although, however, yet</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">but,</span><span class="font3"> by adjuncts such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">even, only, just, surprisingly, still.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proclaim – voice position of as highly warrantable (compelling, valid, plausible, well-founded, agreed, reliable, etc). This contractive meaning can be sub-typed into concur, pronounce and endorse. Concur is conveyed by such locutions, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of course, naturally, admittedly, obviously, etc.</span><span class="font3"> Pronounce involves authorial emphases or explicit authorial interventions, such as these locutions, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I contend, the facts of matter, in fact, indeed,</span><span class="font3"> etc. Endorsement is realized in the use of verbal processes, such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">show, prove, demonstrate, find,</span><span class="font3"> etc.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Heteroglossic: dialogic expansion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Dialogic expansion acts to open up the dialogic space for alternative position. It is categorized into two expansive meanings;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entertain –voice position stands on range of possible position whether to greater or lesser degree. It is conveyed as the assessment of likelihood via modal auxiliaries, such as, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">may, might, could, must, have to, need to;</span><span class="font3"> via modal adjuncts such as, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">perhaps, probably, definitely;</span><span class="font3"> via modal attributes such as, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">it’s possible, it’s likely;</span><span class="font3"> via mental verb such as, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">think, believe, convinced, doubt,</span><span class="font3"> etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attribute –voice positions of some external voice. This can be sub-typed into two; acknowledge and distance. Acknowledge is conveyed by reporting verbs such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">say, report, state, declare, argue, announce, believe</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">think.</span><span class="font3"> Meanwhile, distance is realized rather narrowly locutions, such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">claim</span><span class="font3"> and certain uses of ‘scare’ quotes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">To give the clear view of the system of engagement particularly in terms of heteroglossic resources as discussed in this section, figure below is presented.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Those heteroglossic resources which realized in the form of utterances are aimed to figure out the propositions a speaker/writer intend to address the reader/ listener, also the backdrop lies on it as well. Engagement system also appears to provide a systematic account of characterizing a speaker/writer’s interpersonal style and their rhetorical strategies according to what sort of heteroglossic backdrop or of alternative viewpoints they construct for their text and how they engage to that backdrop. As heteroglossic resource also concerns with value positions in which, in this regard, when speakers/writers announce their attitudinal positions, thus they not only express themselves, but also simultaneously invite the addressee into a place where the feeling, value and belief is shared.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">This section provides the process of engagement system analysis and its finding results. First the data obtained from the transcribed text of Grandi’s press conference is presented by few instances. Then, it is categorized according to its heteroglossic resources whether dialogic expansion or dialogic contraction. Afterward, it is respectively categorized according to its dialogic/ value position, which then put into the table of frequency form to easier the process of quantification of each categories and to make a clear vision of the analysis process. At last, the final data is obtained and the description is made to correlate the result of findings and the theory of engagement system developed by Martin &amp;&nbsp;White in 2005. As the variety of heteroglossic resources may cause confusion in terms, hence this study applies words abbreviations. Firstly, presented here the analysis of heteroglossic contract resources, followed by expansion one.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">It is obtained that the heteroglossic resources construe in the text for 211 realizations, with account of 133 contractions locutions and 78 expansion locutions. Contraction is dominated by disclaim – counter, with account of 55 locutions. Meanwhile, entertain value dominates the expansion meanings with 53 locutions. Therefore, contraction exceeds the expansion for 63% occurrences in the transcribed text uttered by Grandi, while the expansion gives a small percentage in his report for only 37%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Moreover, it is found here that in his press conference release, Grandi takes his stance by heteroglossic resource with predominant contract (63%) - disclaim dialogic position and counter authorial voice. Hence, through the vast number of contraction found, also can be construed that in his report, Filippo Grandi, closes down the space for dialogic alternative, or in other words related to engagement system definition of dialogic contraction, he acts to challenge, fend off or</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">restrict the scope of such propositions and utterances. What can be inferred here as well is that Grandi contracts the chance for another open dialog of the Rohingya refugee crisis in the Bangladesh camp shelter. It implies that what he experiences in person while visiting that camp site appears to be the only source of information that needs to be trusted and unquestioned by the audiences. Yet, the analysis also figures out that the contraction dialogic position is majorly dominated by disclaim voice, not the proclaim one. Take a glance at disclaim definition related to engagement system as the textual voice positions as rejecting, replacing, holding unsustainability and holding not to apply such propositions, construes that Grandi takes stances as most likely to stand across certain propositions of this crisis. The propositions, he stands across of, can be found in the marked transcript of his related press conference release, this study reveals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The most predominant authorial voice found is the counter one. Counter deals with a proposition which would have been expected in its place (Martin and White, 2005). In a clause uttered:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“I was actually in New York at the General Assembly </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">but </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I cut short my visit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That Grandi cut short his visit in New York is presented as defeating his normal activity whose existence necessary needed particularly at the General Assembly required him to be in New York for a few longer time. Another clause of disclaim – counter is uttered as followings; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">But</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">, clearly you know if </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">only </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the people with papers can go back.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The audiences expect that the Head Commissioner could do something to return the refugees with nationalities to Myanmar, but Grandi stands across that expectation for he emphasize that only the refugees with papers (official nationality identification license) who could return back to Myanmar. Besides emphasizing the GoM regulation of refugee to the audience, Grandi also, throughout this statement tells the audience that he couldn’t do any further favor to help the refugee who doesn’t have official papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I spoke to many children that with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shockingly </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">absence of almost emotions, because they were so traumatized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The clause above shows that counter takes role as a set of comment adjuncts/ adverbials. It is commonly and normally believed that children are the creatures who have variety of emotions and is expected to have pleasant experience in their childhood, as this kind of experience may form their complex emotions which also may form their personal characteristic. But, Grandi’s observation speaks oppositely toward that expectation. He finds out through his observation, the emotional condition of the children of Rohingya are totally different with normal expectation. It causes a shocking impact to the reality which happens in the middle of the refugees’ camp shelter. The children there are severely traumatized with any violence they witness, for instance, they witness their mothers and sisters being raped, their house burnt down, and their fathers killed by the military of GoM. Thus, countering clauses found reflects the real belief and value of crisis Grandi intends to inform to his audiences the most. Disclaim – counter is also realized in such utterance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“And the flow has declined although the information we got from various governmental agencies in Bangladesh was that there are displaced people </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">still </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">inside Myanmar, some of whom maybe trying to find their way across the border into Bangladesh.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">still</span><span class="font3"> in the clause above construes Grandi expectation that the refugee flow are not inside Myanmar anymore, but somehow it counters the expectation that there are refugee flows still inside Myanmar. Grandi expects that those displaced people could flee from Myanmar to seek for shelter by crossing the border into Bangladesh. He tries to share his expectation towards it to his audiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus, by seeing the evaluative results of engagement found in Grandi’s press conference</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">release, he tends to share the information about the Rohingya refugee with rather countering position. He presents the report with expected propositions as well as presenting it with the real propositions happen. He tries to tell the world that what they expect to happen in the Bangladesh’ camp shelter may not happen and what the world doesn’t expect to happen there happens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nevertheless, there is still a big number of authorial voice in this study, expansion – entertain takes the second position and occurs for 53 realizations. Entertain makes dialogic space for the possibilities. The authorial voice entertains those dialogic alternatives (Martin and White, 2005). Take a look at the clause below which is presenting the entertain realization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“And the government has made available, as you </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">probably </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">have read, an area of two thousand takers that is going to be destined to professional accommodations for the refugees, and many are already moving there. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">It is suggestion </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to an existing camp that has been managed by UNICEF for many years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Grandi employs </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">probably</span><span class="font3"> in the prior clause in order to mark that there may be some audiences who don’t share the same viewpoint as his on this accommodation for refugee. Before stating that there will be professional accommodation for the refugees, Grandi makes an anticipating position or making space between him and the audiences, in order that the audiences could give him a chance to explain his viewpoints further later on. Then, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">it is suggestion</span><span class="font3"> is such locution which perhaps, may entertain the audiences, regarding that the real situation may cause inconvenience feelings to the audiences. There Grandi also employs entertaining voice in which he give constructive suggestion to the stakeholder of existing camp, which may not do so before. Throughout this entertain voice, Grandi tries to implies that there are a lot of possibilities remain can be happened at the refugee camp shelter in Bangladesh, whether the good ones or even not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The engagement system is quite appropriate to apply in this study, as it concerns with the dialogic perspective. The press conference release reported by Filippo Grandi has taken the audiences to sorts of assumptions and thoughts. People may assume differently in responding to every single clause the Head Commissioner has uttered, but perhaps it affects the audiences with the good effect instead. Related to interpersonal style, engagement system may present one proposition with quite a lot of spoken style, for people with different background and under certain conditions may produce different viewpoint toward it. Therefore, evaluating the language is evidently a field which ultimately interesting to be discussed. It has always taken parts in any era, as long as people communicate. People’s interpretation and assumption toward the finding of the study may also differ. Nonetheless, it is very resourceful entity to enrich the study of language, particularly for language of evaluation field. Though, in this study, the engagement system is being the only domain evaluated, it is still open for doing so for another rest domains, attitude and graduation. This source of appraisal also can be expanded to any other form, such as, printed/ online media, news article, oral/ written speech, presentation, debate or discussion text, artistic masterpiece like, plays and movie script or song lyric, and so forth. This study, by no means, avoids the writers’ personal assumptions and viewpoints about the Rohingya crisis and Grandi’s report on it. The writers have tried their best to put themselves into such a fair and neutral position in evaluating the content of the press release. They also have used the Language of Evaluation (Martin &amp;&nbsp;White, 2005) book as the guidance in evaluating the interpersonal style and engagement system in this study. Therefore, the writers expect that this study’s findings, hopefully, will not cause any offend to any sides. The way of evaluation is also excluded from any political ideology and political intervention and moreover is purely for the language object use. Therefore, to sum up this evaluation, it can be stated that the results of evaluation may vary due to the objects of evaluation, appraisal system domains which is used, certain conditions the objects of propositions are made of, the interpersonal style of the addresser and the addressee in</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The findings show that within the appraisal theory developed by Martin &amp;&nbsp;White in 2005, under subsumed of engagement system domain, the press conference release on Rohingya Refugee Crisis in Bangladesh (2017) reported by Filippo Grandi – the Head Commissioner of UNHCR encodes a predominant heteroglossic backdrop called, dialogic contraction.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This dialogic contraction is construed by a predominantly disclaim value position, in which it is subtypes into deny and counter. Yet, the counter authorial voice has confronted to be the most realization found, for 55 locutions. Therefore, it can be inferred that heteroglossic – contraction backdrop implies Grandi to close down the space for dialogic alternative in his report. Related to disclaim value position, it implies that Grandi takes stance for himself to stand across certain propositions or conditions of the crisis situation in Bangladesh camp shelter. The stances he stands at are realized in the report he utters which convey the counter authorial voice. It reflects the realest crisis condition which Grandi truly intends to inform the audiences. He reports the fact that may against audiences’ expectation, in any other clauses, he describes the situation which can reform audiences’ different viewpoints toward the crisis. This study, perhaps, may attract other linguists to conduct evaluation of language on many kinds of language form. In which, it is expected to shape the new pattern or even theory for certain propositions, particularly in language as communication medium. Yet, humanitarian workers are also expected to involve in language research, as the humanitarian work is not only focusing on humanitarian issue, but also, later on, may be focusing on language use issue.</span></p>
