<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">— </span><span class="font5">The L1 influence causes difficulties for Dayaknese-speaking leaners (hereinafter referred to as learners) of English in producing English sounds. In English, pronunciation plays important role to understand the communication. The purposes of learning English pronunciation for learners are (1) able to communicate in English clearly and intelligibly, (2) able to get the meaning of information conveyed in real life situations, (3) able to improve self-confidence while communicating oral English, and (4) able to monitor the use of English (able to listen, understand, and produce). The teaching of English subject in Indonesian schools includes four skills, namely listening, speaking, reading, and writing. While linguistic elements, such as vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and cultural patterns of discourse are the supporters of these four skills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This current research aimed to describe the implementation of behaviorism learning method and communicative approach as an attempt to improve English pronunciation for learners. This current research was conducted by means of Research and Development (R &amp;&nbsp;D) design, employing the stages as follows: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. Testing was done with experiment, which compares the effectiveness between the old (conventional) learning method and the new method (behaviorism learning method with a communicative approach). The indicators of the effectiveness of new method were the speed of the learners’ understanding, the learners’ creativity, and the learners’ learning outcomes. Experiment was carried out by comparing with previous condition and after using a new learning method (before-after) or also called one group pretest-posttest. Based on statistical count, t count = -34.37 and t table = 1.67, the value of t count falls on Ha acceptance area (new learning method was more effective than conventional learning method) or Ha was accepted and Ho was rejected.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Language learning is essentially an attempt to acquire oral communication skill with an emphasis on acquiring speaking skill and habituation in using language to communicate. Only by</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">290</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/49639-2.png" alt="" style="width:68pt;height:37pt;">
<p><span class="font5">having good communication skill, speakers can express themselves and learn to follow the prevailing social and cultural rules (Kayi, 2006). Relation to language discussion as a tool for communication,there are two methods for mastering the language. Both methods are (1) language acquisition and (2) language learning. Language acquisition is related to the naturalistic type and occurs in the child's subconsciousness, whereas language learning is related to the formal type or the learning process in the classroom (Krashen, 2009; Odisho et al, 2008; Fernandez et al, 2011). Learning process that takes place in the classroom deals with components such as curriculum, syllabus, teachers, students, materials, and media, and learning resources that are prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Referring to the explanation above, the discussion in this article is to master the language through teaching-learning in the formal classroom. The language learning chosen is English pronunciation. Some related studies, Elmaksoud (2013) explained that communicative approach is the effective way for developing EFL learners’ pronunciation of English. Fraser (2001), communicative approach is the appropriate way for teacher and trainer in increasing EFL learners’ pronunciation of English. Therefore, this current research formulated the following statement of the problem: “How is the effectiveness of learning method as an attempt to improve the English pronunciation for learners?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The purpose of this study offers a solution to the problem that occurs in English pronunciation learning using linguistic theories combined with language learning method and technique. Practically, the result of this study can be used by English teachers to address problems in English pronunciation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Language study is a way to expressing various language phenomena based on macrolinguistics and micro-linguistics point of view. The study of macro-linguistics aspects focuses on language relating to other disciplines. On the contrary, micro-linguistics study focuses on language structure, such as phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics (Masreng, 2019:32). Pronunciation is a way of producing sound, which includes sounds, words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs (dialog) (Fraser, 2001; Richards &amp;&nbsp;Schmidt, 2008). Study of pronunciation is</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">291</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/49639-3.png" alt="" style="width:68pt;height:37pt;">
<p><span class="font5">included into two fields. They are phonetics and phonology (Ladefoged, 2011; Kelly, 2006). Phonetics refers to the study of speech sounds produced by human speech organ and phonology refers to the system and pattern of the sounds which exist in particular language (Kelly, 2006; Davenport &amp;&nbsp;Hannahs, 2005; Roach, 2008; Rugg, 2010).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The teaching of English subject in Indonesian schools includes four skills, namely listening, speaking, reading, and writing. While linguistic elements, such as vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and cultural patterns of discourse are the supporters of these four skills (Kirkpatrick, 2007). In English, pronunciation plays important role to understand communication (Carson, 2012; Nelson, 2010).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Behaviorism Learning Method and Communicative Approach</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Teaching English as a foreign language in Indonesia requires an intensive attention to make learners euphoric and excited to learn and must be fully oriented to maintain their English mastery (Sabilah, 2018:5). In line with Sabilah’s idea, the strategy used to improve the mastery of pronunciation is behaviorism learning method and communicative approach. In behaviorism learning theory, learning is a result of the interaction between stimulus and response, learner is able to show changes in behavior. Behaviorism learning theory explains that input in the form of stimulus and output in the form of response. What is meant by stimulus is everything that the teacher gives to the learner, while the response is in the form of a reaction or learner's response to the stimulus given by the teacher. In addition to stimulus and response, other important factors in the flow of behaviorism are reinforcement and punishment factors. Strengthening is a consequence that increases the probability that a behavior will occur. Conversely, punishment is a consequence that decreases the probability of a behavior occurring (Els et al (1991:26).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To overcome and reduce the level of difficulty of the students in learning English, teachers should really pay attention and apply the appropriate approach in teaching English pronunciation (Abreu, Ortage, and Flores, 2013). The communicative approach emphasizes the use of target language (English) in communicating during the learning process takes place and helps learners not only practice the pronunciation but also understand the meaning of the information conveyed (Celce-Murcia, 2008: 7).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">292</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/49639-4.png" alt="" style="width:68pt;height:37pt;">
<p><span class="font5">The purpose of communicative approach is to improve the students’ ability to master second language or foreign language not only the structure but also be able to use the language to communicate in real-life situations and contextually (Richards, 2006). Techniques in learning with communicative approach are game, role play, simulation, drama, storytelling, songs, dictation, tongue twisters, listening discrimination sounds, minimal pairs, and problem solving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are several points to consider in applying communicative approach: (1) classroom learning is emphasized in real communication and focuses on target language learning, (2) teachers as facilitators and provide many opportunities for learners to make experiment or try out to what they know, (3) tolerance with mistakes made by learners during the teaching-learning process in the classroom, because learners can learn from mistakes to get the truth, (4) provide opportunities for learners to develop accuracy and accurately in communicating using the target language, (5) the skills of both productive and receptive language are interrelated and learners are able to apply in real life, and (6) the rules of the target language are obtained directly through communication (Brown, 2010; Richards, 2011: Larsen-Freeman, 2008).</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This study uses the Research and Development (R &amp;&nbsp;D) method with the design of Exploratory Mixed Method. The exploratory mixed method design aims to examine phenomena, identify English segemental sounds and supra-segmental features that are difficult for learners to pronounce, design instrument, and test the instrument (Creswell, 2009: 211). The Exploratory Mixed Method </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">QUAL</span><span class="font8">÷ </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">quan </span><span class="font5">model is chosen because this study uses a combination of two types of data, namely qualitative (QUAL) and quantitative (quan) data. Qualitative data are collected and analyzed first as the main data while quantitative data are collected and analyzed later as supporting data ((Dӧrnyei, 2007: 171). The research method used follows the ADDIE model (Branch and Dousay, 2015) which includes five stages, namely analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To know the effectiveness of the new method, there are three indicators, namely (1) the speed of learners’ understanding, (2) learners’ creativity, and (3) learners’ learning outcomes. The way used to determine the effectiveness of the new method is to compare the results of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">293</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/49639-5.png" alt="" style="width:68pt;height:37pt;">
<p><span class="font5">pre-test and post-test of the XI grade learners of SMA PGRI and SMAN-3 Palangka Raya, which are then analyzed using the t-test formula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The main instrument in this study is the researcher herself and then assisted by other supporting instruments, such as observation sheet, interview sheet, test, validation sheet, Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary 3rd Edition electronic dictionary, recording device, documentation result, scoring sheet, speech analyzer, and audio-visual aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Data collection methods and techniques are the methods used are observation methods with recording, see and note techniques. In the analysis phase, qualitative data is carried out by the intra-lingual equivalent method and the extra-lingual equivalent method with the comparative connection technique equates to the same data, differentiates for different data and excludes other group of data that are similar but not the same (Mahsun, 2007: 117-121). Specifically data relating to interference uses the intra-lingual equivalent method. While the extra-lingual equivalent method is used to analyze the sounds that are pronounced by learners with articulation tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sounds of spoken language associated with acoustics are analyzed by a speech analyzer (Suparwa, Putra, and Malini, 2015). Speech analyzer is a tool that is able to provide accurate calculations on the frequency, intensity, and duration and is able to accurately describe the final intonation pattern (up, down, partially down) at the sentence level. Supra-segmental features that accompany segmental sounds are analyzed using a speech analyzer. Quantitative data analysis from the results of the pre-test, post-test, and questionnaire are carried out by percentage formula.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The research method used follows the ADDIE model which includes five stages, namely analysis design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The procedures followed ADDIE model which were simplified based on the needs of this research. The performed procedures consisting of the followings:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis Phase</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The first stage of the study carried out contrastive analysis between the Dayak Ngaju language, Indonesian, and English to collect data on the same sounds (positive transfer) and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">294</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">S 772442 758009</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">different sounds (negative transfer / interference). Based on the hypothesis in contrastive analysis, the cause of the difficulty of learners in learning the target language is interference. At this stage a pre-test was given to measure learners' initial knowledge of English pronunciation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design Phase</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The second stage was the design stage carried out with the Research Library which was a study of syllabus and teaching material to be adjusted to learning needs.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development Phase</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The third stage was the stage for developing the learning method design based on the results of validation and revision and suggestions from expert judges.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation Phase</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The fourth stage was the implementation of learning method that had been developed in the previous stage at the research location. The selection of samples in qualitative research was more precisely done intentionally (purposive sampling).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Phase</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The fifth stage was the stage of measuring the effectiveness of the new learning method after it had been applied to class XI students, amounting to 50 learners at the study site. The way used to determine the effectiveness of the new method was to compare the results of the students’ pre-test and post-test, which were then analyzed using the t-test formula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following is the value explanation of the comparison between pre-test and post-test. </span><span class="font5">After obtaining the pre-test (O1) results of 49% and post-test (O2) of 85.5%, the next step was to test the new method using the t-test formula. The calculation was done using the SPSS program. Testing with a correlated t-test used the right-hand test because the alternative hypothesis read &quot;better&quot;. If the value of t falls in the Ha acceptance area, Ha which states that &quot;the effectiveness of the behaviorism learning method with the communicative approach is better than the old method (conventional).&quot; Based on statistical calculation, the value of t count was -34, 37 and t table was 1.67, then Ha was accepted and Ho was rejected.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicative practice</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The design of the learning method can be explained briefly as follows. Contrative analysis that produces positive transfer theory and negative transfer (interference) becomes the background for the creation of a learning model design. The chosen approach is a communicative approach that is equipped with aspects (1) language theory, (2) learning theory (behaviorism theory), (3) learning objectives, (4) syllabus, (5) types of activities, (6) the role of teachers, (7) the role of students, and (8) the role of teaching materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The learning method chosen is a method of variation, namely lecture, discussion, demonstration, drill &amp;&nbsp;practice, simulation etc. The procedures applied are communicative learning method which consists of five stages described below.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explanation and Demonstration</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">At this stage the teacher gives an explanation both verbal and written ways about how the sounds of language produced by human speech organ when communicating verbally. The</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">296</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/49639-10.png" alt="" style="width:68pt;height:37pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">teacher demonstrates how to pronounce segmental sounds and supra-segmental features using his/her own voice and mouth as a model. In order for the learning process to run smoothly and the material to be easily remembered by learners, the teacher has to use media such as video and visual symbols (phonetic symbols). The use of phonetic symbols is adjusted to the age of learners. In this study phonetic symbols had to be presented in each learning process considering the XI-class learners were in the ages ranging from 15-22 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In starting the learning process, the teacher can use deductive or inductive techniques. In deductive techniques the teacher can start an explanation and be followed by an example. While inductive techniques, the teacher can begin learning by giving examples of variations in accordance with the rules and patterns in the explanation given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the pronunciation learning process, the teacher should teach sound gradually, because the pronunciation learning process requires a lot of time to practice. The training model can be done with the Explanation-Practice-Explanation-Practice pattern.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening Practice</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">At this stage students practice distinguishing similar segmental sounds. Learners have difficulty in distinguishing similar sounds, examples of distinguishing fricative +voiced [ð] and plosive +voiced [d]; distinguish the fricative -voiceless [θ] and plosive –voiceless [t]; distinguish fricative sound +voiced [ð] and the sound of the fricative - sound [θ]. Exercises can be given in minimal pairs and &quot;same or different&quot;: Learners listen to two words and explain whether the two words are the same or different. Example: the sound [ð] in the words “they” and the plosive sound +voiced [d] in the word “day”. Exercises in other forms are matching words that are pronounced with words written or pictures (Matching words to written words or pictures). Example: long vowel sound [i:] in “sheep” and short vowel [</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ɪ</span><span class="font5">] in “ship”. Students listen to the words pronounced by the teacher or friend and then match the available writing or image.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this stage, learners practice not only on segmental sounds but also on suprasegmental features, such as pressure and intonation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlled Practice</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Controlled practice is a structured exercise. At this stage, the teacher gives time for students to train the organ of speech in reciting segmental sounds and supra-segmental features that are taught in the form of sentences and short dialogues prepared by the teacher. Exercise</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">297</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/49639-11.png" alt="" style="width:68pt;height:37pt;">
<p><span class="font5">models can be done by doing short conversations (short conversations), listen and repeat, minimal pairs in words and sentences. Another example, pronunciation of English consonant clusters that are on the onset position, is an example of the word “strength” [streɳθ], “modern” [ɒmɒdn], and “standard” [ʹstændǝd] in the coda position. The pronunciation of ‘strength” and “modern” without insertion of neutral vowel sounds [ə]. Whereas the pronunciation “standard” without pronouncing the plosive +voiced [-d]. To help learners in improving pronunciation of consonant clusters, the teacher explains the patterns of the English syllable structure and provides varied examples, such as pronunciation of suffixes -s [-s, -z, -ɪz, -t, -d, -ɪd].</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guided Practice</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Guided practice is structured exercises. Teacher provides training in a higher level form than controlled exercise. For example, the teacher asks learners to practice reciting the consonant sounds of fricative -voiced [θ]. Training techniques can be in the form of conversations, story telling, reading aloud, dictation, and games.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicative Practice</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">At this level, practice has already included into speaking skill. Teacher only provides a framework. learners are expected to be able to improve their creative thinking skill in developing what is given by the teacher and be able to determine their own training techniques to be used. Students are expected to be able to communicate using English with pronunciation that is intelligibility. Training techniques can be drama, role play, storytelling, song, game, poem, and conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The second novelty is methodological analysis of acoustic phonetic data by using tool named speech analyzer. This tool is able to accurately measure the frequency, intensity, and duration of supra-segmental features pronounced by learners. In addition to providing accurate measurements, the speech analyzer is also able to accurately describe the final tone pattern of sentences, such as the final tone up, down, and partially down.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusions and Recommendations</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">In an effort to improve English pronunciation learning abilities, this study designed a learning model called behaviorism learning method with a communicative approach. This learning model was developed based on the related aspects, namely language theory, learning theory (behaviorism and CLT), learning objectives (identifying and reciting segmental sounds and suprasegmental English features, English syllabus (even semester XI syllabus ), types of activities (listen and repeat, phonetic training, minimal pairs drill, games, tongue twisters, contextualized reading aloud, role play, and song), the role of the teacher, the role of students, and the role of teaching material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By looking at the advantages of the new method, it is recommended for English teacher to apply this learning method in teaching English pronunciation. Here are some advantages of the new learning model.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behaviorism learning model with a communicative approach is very suitable to be applied in English pronunciation learning which emphasizes drill &amp;&nbsp;practice.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behaviorism learning model with a communicative approach implements learning activities that are in accordance with Minister of National Education Regulation No. 41 in 2007 year concerning standard processes, namely the existence of preliminary activities, core activities, and closing activities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behaviorism learning method with a communicative approach implements learning steps based on communicative approaches, namely (1) explanation and demonstration, (2) listening practice to distinguish similar sounds, (3) controlled practice (exercises in examples are simple), (4) guided practice, and (5) communicative practice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behaviorism learning method with a communicative approach applying a tool. It is named speech analyzer. This tool used to analyze supra-segmental features.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behaviorism learning model with a communicative approach provides assessment rubrics in the form of performance criteria that can help teachers assess the level of learners’ understanding, learners’ creativity, and learners’ learning outcomes in large classes.</span></p></li></ul>
