<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Indonesian tourism is well known. However, developments continue to be made to improve the quality and tourists, both local and foreign. One particular interest in tourism that has garnered special attention is travel related to sports tourism. The World Tourism Organization and the </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></a><span class="font1">74</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">International Olympic Committee held an international conference on sport and tourism in February 2001 in Barcelona. This conference presented the link between sport and tourism by leading global organizations of sport and tourism (Hinch and Higham, 2004).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tourism is one of the recreational experiences that has a positive impact on the economy in various countries; this is</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">e-ISSN 2407-392X. p-ISSN 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">based on the research of the International World Tourism Organization (WTO) in 2001, which shows that the contribution of sports to the domestic product of the country's gross industry ITAS BA is between 12%, causing the contribution of tourism between 4-6% (Ritchie and Adair, 2004). Gammon and Robinson (2003) divide the classification of sports and tourism consumers into 2 (two) definitions, namely Sports tourism and Tourism sports. Sports tourism analyzes individuals and groups actively and passively participating in competitive or recreational sports while travelling or living in their usual environment. The main criterion of sport tourism is that sport is the primary purpose of travelling (travelling). At the same time, sports tourism is intended for tourists who travel and live in places outside their usual environment. Therefore, it can be actively and passively involved, competitive sports or recreation with a secondary purpose of travel. In other words, involvement in sports activities is not the primary purpose of travelling (travelling).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In its development, now there are many events defined as an activity or events intentionally created to build interaction with visitors to provide an exciting and impressive experience directly. The event is an activity held to commemorate important things throughout human life, either individually or in groups bound by custom, culture, tradition, and religion. It fits a specific purpose and involves the community environment, which is held at a particular time. (Noor, 2009) The successful implementation of an event must have the support of good planning and preparation and meet the standard event indicators. Related to event planning, Joe Goldblatt (2002) divides planning in organizing an event into several stages, namely research, design, planning, coordination, and evaluation. Meanwhile, this study only uses 3 (three) phases, namely research, strategy and planning, because </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></a><span class="font1">75</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">this research is a proposal and recommendation material to the local government, which can be helpful to see how event management is carried out in Hambalang Village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The tourism sector has the potential for developing sports tourism, namely in the Tourism Village, which has some potential for developing sports tourism and competitive events. One is located in Ham-balang Village, Citeureup District, Bogor Regency. Hambalang village is situated in a hilly area with an altitude of 300-450 meters above sea level, between the Jonggol-Hambalang mountain range. Hambalang Village has been designated as a tourist village through a decree issued by the village head. The development of tourism potential in Hambalang Village based on nature and religion that explores diversity, uniqueness and uniqueness makes this village worthy of being developed into a tourist village. Its location, which is not far from the centre of Bogor City and the capital city, makes the village development so fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hambalang village has a lot of potential and adequate accessibility, namely a large area for vehicle parking and trekking routes that can be used for competitive activities or competitions such as Motocross, cycling, running and others to serve as sports events. Several small activities that have been carried out in Hambalang Village are the Nusantara Village League and Hambalang Village Sports Week (Pordes). Utilization of the potential and accessibility that is owned is still limited, so it is necessary to plan a more significant event aimed at improving the quality of tourism in Hambalang Village, Bogor Regency, and increasing regional competitiveness, including in the field of sport tourism. This sports tourism owned by Hambalang Village requires special attention and sustainable management. The presence of the government through its various policy strategies becomes a strategic thing in </span><span class="font1">e-ISSN 2407-392X. p-ISSN 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">making tourism a mainstay sector in raising the standard of living of the community, especially local communities in the tourist village development area (Rahu, 2021).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Optimizing tourism planning and management requires various elements to collaborate with stakeholders; this strategy is an idea inspired by several tourism managers (Lumintuarso, 2005). These five strategies are known as the pentahelix model. The Pentahelix model for tourism in Indonesia is known as the ABCGM strategy, which stands for. This research is a series of Scientific Research in 2021 with a village research scheme from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology, Directorate General of Higher Education, Research and Technology. From some of the explanations above, the results of this study will produce new things or new findings that can be used as recommendations to local governments in the pentahelix model in Hambalang Village, Bogor Regency. There for it is necessary to research tourism planning and management in the industrial sector of Hamba-lang Village, Bogor Regency, to serve as sports tourism and events that can improve the regional economy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hambalang village has a lot of potential related to nature and religious tourism that can be developed and managed further. This pentahelix model approach is very much needed for managing and developing facilities and infrastructure in Ham-balang Village by involving participation and various parties to realise tourism progress in Hambalang Village. In planning sports tourism and the event itself, it is necessary to collaborate between stakeholders and elements of the government who have political power on how to formulate a policy through quick decisions of the community or community, which is called social power. This collaboration is expected to increase productivity, innovation, creativity, and Regional Original Income (PAD) in </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></a><span class="font1">76</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hambalang Village, Bogor Regency. Based on the problems mentioned above, the researchers conducted a study entitled &quot;Pentahelix Model in Planning Sport Tourism and Events in Hambalang Village, Bogor Regency&quot; from (Academic, Business, Community, Government and Media).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The research was conducted in Hambalang Village, Sentul-Bogor, Citeureup District, Bogor Regency. Data were collected through observation, interviews, Focus Group Discussion (FGD), and documentation studies. Comments were made in Hambalang Village, Bogor Regency, to find out physically available tourism so that they can identify and make a point of view about how much the regional government and village communities contribute to planning and managing sports tourism and events in Hambalang Village. Interviews were conducted with the local government consisting of the village head of Hambalang and the sub-district head of citeureup, Bogor district. The community consists of the Head of Tourism Village, Youth Organization, BUM-Des, Hambalang Village Community and MSMEs. In the academic field, the Faculty of Tourism, Pancasila University.

<p><span class="font2">In addition to collecting primary data, secondary data is also collected. The information is the profile of &quot;Hambalang Village&quot;, regional data in general, and tourism data in search locations from books and other literature sources, as well as searches for various information published in both electronic and print media. Researchers also collect visual data in the form of photos and videos. Data validity was obtained through source triangulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The data analysis of this study used descriptive qualitative research, which was</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">analyzed with an emphasis on interactive data analysis Miles and Huberman (1984) said in Lisa (2010) that the analysis consisted of 3 (three) flows of activities that co-occurred, namely: data reduction, data presentation, and conclusion drawing/veri-fication.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Hambalang Village, located in the highlands makes Hambalang Village have various natural tourism potentials, including hills where every tourist who visits can enjoy beautiful natural scenery along the road to Hambalang Village. In addition, residents' green clove plantations and gardens, plus a relaxed atmosphere, can also be used as a tourist attraction in Hamba-lang Village. The number of residents in Hambalang Village every year has increased. This is influenced because investors have also ogled Hambalang Village; in this area, there are buildings owned by residents from outside the village; even in the future, it will be developed as a tourist area, making it possible for many migrants to reside and settle in the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This Communities in the Hamba-lang Village area mostly have several livelihood sectors: agriculture, plantation, animal husbandry, fisheries, forestry, small industry or household crafts, medium and large industries, trade and services. Land in the Hambalang Village area is prioritized for use in the plantation sector. The plantation products cultivated by the Hambalang Village community include Cloves, Pineapple, Salak, Jackfruit and Oranges. The dominance of livelihoods in the plantation sector shows that the Hambalang Village community highly depends on land resources.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Sports Tourism and Tourism Sport in Hambalang Village</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Sports tourism is devoted to analyzing individuals and/or groups of people who actively and passively participate in competitive or recreational sports while travelling or living in their usual environment. The main criterion of sport tourism is that sport is the primary purpose of travel (Gammon and Robinson, 2003). Sports tourism is one type of tourism activity that is developing quite rapidly because more and more tourists are interested in sports. Hambalang village has characteristics in the development of sports tourism, namely, Hambalang mini stadium, trekking paths, accessibility, and a large parking area. It can be used as an alternative to sports tourism for sports lovers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sports tourism is currently developing because it has a positive influence on other sectors. in addition to its natural and religious tourist attractions, it also has the potential for sports tourism, namely having several attractions, namely trekking and paragliding. Hambalang Village is also expected to be a place for sports events, especially soccer, arrows, paragliding, and Motocross, at the regional level so that it can become a tourist attraction to attract more tourists visiting Hambalang Village. Before the construction of the mini stadium was carried out, Hambalang Village had hosted sporting events, such as the Nusantara Village League, which was attended by representatives of football groups from 12 sub-districts in Bogor Regency and PARDES or Hambalang Village Sports Week, which 8 RW and 28 RT attended. Several types of sport tourism in Hamba-lang Village can be developed and provide a significant tourism contribution to the community. The following are the potential and attractions of sport tourism in Hambalang Village:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trekking</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Physical potential in the form of natural conditions of trekking routes or paths and specific locations can be a tourist attraction for trekking (DPO Prasiasa, 2019). Trekking is a long journey that is carried out by walking from one place to another, such as for expeditions and others; trekking is usually carried out in the interior of an area that has not been touched by urban communities, with travel routes that are in areas with minimal facilities and infrastructure or not even there yet. (Paseban Consortium, 2022) Hambalang Village has hosted a sporting activity, the &quot;Grass track&quot;, a small-scale competition activity carried out by the Hambalang trail community. This activity was carried out in 2014.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragliding</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the observations of Ham-balang Village, the development of Ham-balang Village into a Tourism Village now has a new attraction, namely paragliding. This paragliding is a collaboration between Agrotourism Villa Bukit Hambalang and ATS (Atang Sanjaya). The purpose of the partnership is for members to do paragliding exercises in the air. In November 2021, a para-gliding trial was carried out by taking off from the top of the Hambalang hill and landing on the field at Villa Bukit Hambalang Agrotourism. But for now, it cannot be opened 100% in general. But if visitors are interested in paragliding in Hambalang Village, it can be done in tandem. In addition, visitors can also see paragliding activities around Villa Bukit Hambalang Agrotourism or go up to the top of the hill to see how flying paragliding takes place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the interviews and observations above, the touch of sport tourism brings many benefits to the community's economy through sports tourism in the form of trekking and paragliding. Moreover, the area can promote according to its </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></a><span class="font1">78</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">potential so that a good marketing effect appears to invite investors or tourists in that direction through several events that have been held, such as the Nusantara Village League, PARDES, and tribal affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sports activities cannot be separated from other activities and people's daily lives. Sports activities have become a need humans must meet because they can make the body fitter than before. Currently, sports activities have undergone many changes in progress. Namely, it is not enough in sports aimed at physical fitness; recreational sports are developing very rapidly. More and more sports are becoming tourist destinations, especially sports that take advantage of natural facilities such as mountains, lakes, rivers, and oceans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tourism sport is intended for tourists who travel or live in places outside their usual environment. It can be actively and passively involved in competitive or recreational sports by making it a secondary destination of tourist travel (Gammon and Robinson 2003). In other words, tourists whose travels are partly involved in some form of sport or recreation on a purely incidental basis. Currently, sports activities have undergone many changes in progress. Namely, it is not enough for jokes aimed at physical fitness, but recreational sports are developing rapidly. As a result, more and more sports are becoming tourist destinations, especially sports that take advantage of natural facilities such as mountains, lakes, rivers, and oceans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the results of research through direct observation of Hambalang Village, Citeureup District, it can be concluded that in its development into a tourist village, Hambalang Village continues to bring in many tourists from outside the area to outside the city to visit tourist attractions owned by Hambalang Village, especially in sport tourism activities or recreational sports. In addition, Hambalang Village also has facilities like a mini </span><span class="font1">e-ISSN 2407-392X. p-ISSN 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hambalang stadium and trekking trails. Some of the findings of recreational sports facilities and activities from researchers during observations made by tourists in Hambalang Village are as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hambalang Mini Stadium</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the results of secondary data obtained through the article Radar Bogor Rany Sinaga (2021), the construction of the Hambalang mini stadium is a manifestation of the tagline &quot;The City of Sport and Tourism&quot; in Bogor Regency, especially in Hambalang Village. As for the management of the mini stadium, it is handed over to BUMDes by involving village institutions such as youth organizations and other youth organizations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trekking Path</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The trekking path before as it is now is still only a small road that is usually used for the activities of cassava farmers carrying their harvests on their shoulders. This makes this road widening to facilitate the accessibility of the community; cassava farmers are no longer accepted but can use a car or motorbike. The trekking route has been operating for a long time and is often used for small-scale sporting events. These activities are usually carried out and organized by outside parties, namely the communities who want to hold a Motocross sport event in Hambalang Village.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bicycle</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Cycling has become an active trend in this decade with the increasing sales of bicycles globally. Cycling is defined by tourists as an integral part of excursions or holidays, a profitable way to improve the quality of vacation time (Lumsdon, 2000 in Wirawan, 2016). Based on the results of interviews that have been carried out, tourists coming to Hamba-lang Village not only aim to have fun or travel to see the natural scenery of Hambalang Village but for sports while recreational, pampering the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">hobby of cycling with obstacles and also the stunning natural scenery that Hamba-lang Village has. They come to Hambalang Village not only on holidays but on weekdays they cycle in Hambalang.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hambalang Trail Bike</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Dirt bike sport is one of the most popular sports for extreme sports lovers. A sport that uses a dirt bike as the main component that is carried out in nature for an adventure through a trajectory that flows from Region A to Region B and C in the form of roads, forest areas, slopes, hills, and others (Otosia Editor, 2019). Based on the results of interviews, in addition to cycling and para-gliding, tourists also come to do Trabas at the top of Hambalang to try the trail path at the top of Hambalang. Furthermore, the Ghalib Garage community and many other communities visit Hamba-lang to experience the trails in the area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the results of interviews that have been carried out, it can be concluded that tourism sport is one type of tourism activity that is developing quite rapidly, including in Hambalang Village. Hambalang Village, which has quite good geographical characteristics, namely its location on high land, has good natural and sport potential, becomes an alternative for recreational sports for some sports lovers such as cycling, trekking and tribal, as well as the availability of sports facilities that support activities such as stadiums. Mini Hambalang and trekking trails. Seeing the natural conditions in Hambalang Village with various tourist activities, this sport tourism is indeed intended for tourists with great adrenaline because paragliding and trail bikes are sports that can be considered quite extreme.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Sport Event Planning in Hambalang Village</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The successful implementation of an event must have the support of good</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">planning and preparation and meet standard sport event indicators starting from the formulation of goals and setting of the concept to how the efforts are made to achieve victory in the event bidding process successfully and when it reaches the implementation stage. First, activities can run according to what has been previously determined, then proceed with an evaluation to analyze whether everything is going according to expectations, at least going through a good planning process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All planning stages are running and well understood by all stakeholders. The researcher refers to an Event Management planning model by Joe Goldblatt (2002), which consists of 5 (five) stages, namely research, design, planning, coordination, and evaluation. However, this study only uses 3 (three) phases, namely research, strategy, and planning, because this research is a proposal and recommendation material to the local government, which can be helpful to see how event management is carried out during events in Ham-balang Village.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1.</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The formulation of the research process carried out by Hambalang Village is related to determining the needs, desires, and expectations of the target market based on the also research conducted by external parties. What is meant by internal parties is human resources in Hambalang Village, and what is meant by external is relationships with audience parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the results of interviews conducted that the research process carried out by Hambalang Village in determining a concept at the beginning was comprehensive research and tended to be more objective rather than subjective as seen from the current market needs, namely, the research process that refers to market needs, in this case, is the audience of the event to be held.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">2.</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Through the research process that has been carried out, the next step is the theme and material about the event concept that will be used as event packaging. In this case, it refers to a theory about the design process in which it explains about doing brainstorming related to concepts and themes or ideas about organizing events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the results of interviews, determining themes and concepts in an event organization in Hambalang Village does not take too long. However, from the EO's point of view, explaining the process of determining the concept that takes a long time refers to market needs, in this case, the event's audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So, it can be concluded that the ideas or ideas about the concept of the event that resulted from the research process that occurred at the beginning were very diverse from some research results, which will then become the process of forming it into ideas or ideas that are generated.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">3.</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the results of interviews conducted through the research and design processes that have been carried out, then the following method of supporting planning and preparation is suitable and meets standard event indicators starting from the formulation of goals, and setting concepts, to how efforts or strategies are to be successful in achieving the goals set. Desired. We are planning an event is how to formulate strategies which are then ready to be implemented to support the success of an event. Such as determining the target market, venue, and risk management scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following event activities can be considered for making event activities in Hambalang Village based on event planning indicators, namely research, design and planning.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">At the stage of the Penatahelix model in planning sports tourism and events in Hambalang Village, what is seen is the involvement or role of various actors to work together in developing the Hamba-lang Village Tourism Village planning sports tourism and events.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Academics on the Penta helix model act as drafters. At this stage, the role of socialization and training in planning and managing sports tourism and events in Hambalang Village through the first stage, namely seeing the readiness of the community by taking approaches such as efforts to introduce tourism and other forms of sport</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">tourism and events in Hambalang Village and training on how to organize events.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Private business/industry in the pentahelix model acts as an enabler or facilitator. At this stage, the Agrotourism Villa Bukit Hambalang has played a direct role in the activities of the Hambalang Village community, especially in sport tourism and event activities, including in terms of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">budget and providing sports facilities. However, it has not been maximized in building infrastructure for Hambalang Village.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The community in the pentahelix model acts as an accelerator. Hambalang Village is in the process of being developed into a Tourism Village, forming a community, namely MSMEs. This community was created to strengthen coordination between MSME actors and make it easier for them to develop their businesses. In addition, the existence of MSMEs has become a supporting facility in sport tourism and events in Hambalang village. The role of MSMEs in the community in sport tourism and event activities in Hambalang Village is instrumental in supporting facilities such as food stalls, toilets, and resting places that are quite supportive for sport tourism activities and events in Hambalang Village.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The government in the pentahelix model acts as a regulator and controller with regulations and responsibilities in developing businesses. The role of the Regional Government in developing Hamba-lang Village into a tourist village by creating the potential for sports tourism in Hamba-lang Village by realizing the tagline &quot;Bogor Sport and Tourism&quot;. In addition, the Hambalang Village government also acts as a facilitator by creating conducive conditions for the implementation of development to bridge various kinds of community interests in optimizing sports tourism and event planning in Hambalang Village. As a facilitator, the village government is engaged in providing facilities and licensing the use of places during the 2022 Focus Group Discussion (FGD) activity organized by the Faculty of Tourism, Pancasila University and will support</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">subsequent mentoring activities through training, education and skills improvement. The Hambalang Village Government, in planning sports tourism and events, also acts as a facilitator related to funding or capital through providing capital assistance to empowered communities. The form of contribution and support made to Hambalang Village regards security, order, and comfort to the village community in activities organized by Hambalang Village.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Media</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Media serves as a provider of information, education, entertainment, and social controller. In developing Hambalang Village into a tourist village, Tribunnews acts as a media that publishes through online media related to the readiness of Hambalang Village to become a nature, religion, and sport tourism-based tourism village. For example, an article published on April 2, 2022, entitled &quot;Hambalang Ready to be Developed as a Nature-Based Tourism Village, Religion and Sport Tourism&quot;, contains the readiness of Hambalang Village to become a nature-based tourism village, religion, and sports tourism through Focus Group Discussion activities (FGD).</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/93013-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:205pt;height:180pt;">

<p><span class="font2">In addition, the purpose of tribunnews is to inform the general public about Hambalang Village. Tribunnews is suitable for Hambalang Village because Tribunnews has a humanist writing angle. A Humanist is meant to be able to react to an article or an object that many people can consume. So, the angle is an angle for expanding people to read the news. With the ease of accessing social media by anyone, anytime and anywhere, people are starting to leave conventional promotional methods such as print and electronic media and switch to social media, which is considered adequate.</span></p>
