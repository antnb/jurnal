<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the current era, the biggest issue that is often discussed in tourism development is technological progress. There is no denying that tourism depends on technological advances that affect the industry in its operations, Technology systems empower consumers to customize the way they buy tourism products and support the globalization of the industry by providing tools to develop, and distribute offerings worldwide. Increasingly, technological systems are playing an important role for organizational competitiveness and for tourism purposes (Buhalis 1998; Poon 1993; Sheldon 1995). This can be seen in the tourism industry, especially travel agents in computerized reservation systems and ticket systems that have faced major changes in global distribution. Technological developments have made it easier for customers or tourists to make their own reservations and buy products directly via the internet in the Online Travel Agent (OTA) industry. Tourists no longer need to move from their place, simply by operating the application that has been provided by OTA, travel schedules, places to stay to payment methods can be arranged according to their wishes (Lintong, 2015). This model is more acceptable to the current lifestyle of the community (Pradiatiningtyas, 2015). The impact, broadly, is that tens to hundreds of conventional travel agents who rely on traditional models have to compete until they are out of business due to the shift of travelers using OTA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In particular, the presence of technological advances has brought great changes to the travel industry, especially in terms of connecting and interacting with customers in terms of tourist travel activities. As a result, the travel industry has to adapt their business activities based on various technology sources to improve operational efficiency and meet customer expectations. Lohman &amp;&nbsp;Schmucker (2009:32) argue that the internet has a growing influence in various tourism markets, this is related to consumer information and their booking behavior has changed dramatically since online services and bookings were introduced, so the growth of the travel industry requires information technology. to manage the increasing volume and quality of tourism (Law et al.</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font12"> 2004). This is a big challenge for the travel industry in providing sustainable investment in order to change its business activities in accordance with current technological advances. The travel industry as a company in the travel service business is a company that also carries out its function in management where we know that aspects of planning, organizing, and directing are very important functions in management. In a travel industry there must be Human Resources (HR) which is the most valuable asset in driving the success of a company but so far there are still some weaknesses from Indonesian HR such as low productivity, low level of education and mastery of foreign languages, as well as skills and expertise. that is not adequate, for that serious attention is needed to improve the quality of Indonesian human resources (Pramudyo, 2014). HR in a travel industry plays a role as a workforce which of course must have ideal competencies and has an important role in the travel industry's operational system, namely as the spearhead in carrying out management functions. Success in achieving the vision and mission of the travel industry is the main goal in building a business. To be able to meet these goals, we need someone who is able to push the company towards a better direction by creating new strategies that will meet the company's goals, namely the achievement of the company's vision and mission. This figure can be a leader who is able to work effectively and efficiently in a company. The more reliable a leader is in carrying out his role, the faster the company's performance will be seen which will later become work performance for all human resources working in the travel industry company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To realize the ideal conditions mentioned above, the travel industry must always be able to make changes to the work system commonly known as work culture in an organization. Organizational culture is able to influence the work atmosphere which is expected to change</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">the old system into a more effective work system, because organizational culture plays an important role in an organization, especially in terms of determining the policies taken by an organization. Culture is not only about how interactions are created in society, but culture can also be developed in a company whose system is in accordance with work habits that have been set by a company. Culture can be said as a basic understanding that is understood by the workforce in the company which has elements of norms, values and habits that affect the way of thinking, communication and daily work behavior of employees in the company, all of which will result in quality performance. company. Organizational culture is formed from a group of people who are organized by motivation, and the culture within the organization which has an important impact on improving a performance (Gultom, 2014). The role of employees in changing the work culture system to be more effective and efficient in accordance with technological developments in the current 4.0 era can only be achieved if they have strong support from top management whose leadership style is top-down. Top management, in this case company leaders, can formulate clear standard operating procedures in the process of changing work systems that are more effective and efficient in accordance with technological developments in the 4.0 era, besides that, leaders in the travel industry can also develop technology-based HR development strategies, by implementing talent mapping and requires every workforce or employee in the travel industry to be able to adapt to the progress and development of the work culture system within the company through the use of technology. In addition to the role of business strategy in organizational culture that affects the relationship between technology and performance (Ellitan, 2002), another issue that develops is 'will the relationship between technology and performance be the same in different environmental conditions?' The environmental conditions that will be discussed here are focused on environmental conditions. based on the availability-scarcity of human resources in the travel industry. Related to this issue, previous studies have found inconsistent results, namely the availability of resources can strengthen and weaken the relationship between technology and performance. Meyer &amp;&nbsp;Goes (1988); Schroeder &amp;&nbsp;Sohal (1999) have found that the relationship between technological innovation and performance will be stronger for large organizations that have abundant resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The travel industry in Indonesia is quite developed in its operational business, one of which is the travel industry in South Sulawesi Province. As we know that South Sulawesi is a transit city in eastern Indonesia where tourism is also quite developed in this area, even South Sulawesi is currently being used as a model for the concept of tourism in the marine tourism sector, it is not surprising to see many tourist travel industries building their businesses in the marine tourism sector. South Sulawesi. Today the travel industry in South Sulawesi is faced with the challenge of rapidly developing technology, where the tourism travel industry in South Sulawesi must be more observant of the challenges and opportunities in the 4.0 era where technology and human resources must be directly proportional so that business development can be more accurate and directive. on the trend in accordance with the wishes of the market. The phenomenon that occurs is that there are many tourist travel industries in South Sulawesi which are less able to compete and must be willing to close their businesses, is a concern because it not only causes great losses but also involves human welfare. In response to this, the ability and performance of HR in the travel industry must be prepared in advance in the face of technological developments in the industrial era 4.0 in order to be able to compete and have the ability and competitive strategy in the travel industry. Human resources that are declared superior, especially in the field of travel, must have their own parameters so that the capacity of human resources in the field of tourism can be measured clearly and on target. So far there</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">has been no specific research in assessing Human Resources in the travel industry, especially in the South Sulawesi area in relation to the impact of technological developments in the 4.0 era.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/75058-4.png" alt="" style="width:453pt;height:507pt;">
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Fig. 1. Research Model</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Technology Development and Organizational Culture. Based on the results of research conducted by Budhi (2018), stated that after conducting the analysis the conclusion was that the use of technology had an effect on employee performance and organizational culture where the percentage produced was 78% organizational culture was influenced by technology, as well as technology affects employee performance by 95%. The mission, involvement and</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">inconsistency in organizational culture positively affect the accounting information system of small and medium-sized firms in Vietnam (Dung, 2020). Hypothesis 1: The development of information technology systems has a positive and significant effect on organizational culture</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Technology Development and Employee Performance. Technological progress is the process of combining and rearranging knowledge to generate new ideas. Technological developments have an impact on company performance (Mumford, 2007). Technological progress comes from internal progress (Pavitt, 1990), and internal progress comes from the capabilities of employees. So there is a close relationship between technological progress and employee performance (Huselid, 1995). Technology can only lead to increased productivity or increased performance when combined with other resources effectively by human resources or when it is done effectively, and using technology productively and ethically (Ojo et al., 2020; Dauda &amp;&nbsp;Akingbade, 2011</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font12"> 2009). Employee performance is closely related to technological advances. Technological advances can be managed effectively through employees. Resourcebased theory shows that company resources are very important for the development of the company, and that human resources are the main resource of the company. The function of these resources depends on the ability and enthusiasm of employees, and on efficient human resource management (Harsh &amp;&nbsp;Prasad, 2021; Mumford, 2007). Technological progress has a major influence on employee performance (Ratna et al., 2020; Nohria &amp;&nbsp;Gulati, 1996). Technological progress is an important factor to influence performance improvement (Hitt et al., 1997). Most research results indicate a positive relationship between technological progress and employee performance, and conclude that technological developments are important for employee performance (Foster, 1986).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hypothesis 2: The development of information technology systems has a positive and significant effect on employee performance</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Leadership style and organizational culture. Often research is conducted that the behavior of transformational leaders has a significant effect on organizational culture. According to Bass &amp;&nbsp;Avolio (1993), organizational culture is often the creation of its founders. Suhana (2007) examined the relationship between leadership style, organizational culture, commitment and performance. Significant relationships were found between leadership style and organizational culture, leadership style and commitment, and between organizational culture and performance. According to Schein (2004) Culture is created by leaders, while leaders are created by culture. Yukl (2005) argues that organizational leaders have strong talents in strengthening and instilling aspects of organizational culture with 5 (five) main systems, namely, attention, reaction to crises, role modeling, reward allocation and selection criteria and dismissal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hypothesis 3: Leadership style has a positive and significant effect on organizational culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Leadership Style and Employee Performance. Research by Humphreys (2002) proves the critical role of transformational leadership in improving employee performance. Bono &amp;&nbsp;Judge (2003) also found transformational leadership affects employee performance. Performance in Bono &amp;&nbsp;Judge (2003) study is measured from several aspects, so they conclude that transformational leadership will affect employee performance under any circumstances. Bass et al., (2003) showed a strong influence between transformational leadership on employee performance compared to transactional leadership. Bass et al., (2003) explain that transformational leadership focuses on employee self-development, motivates employees to act and think innovatively in solving problems and achieving organizational goals and objectives, encouraging enthusiasm and optimism for a job so that employee performance often exceeds expectations. This condition is contrary to the transactional leadership style which is</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">more concerned with targets based on the principle of exchange which may actually have a negative impact in the long term. Research by Shea (1999) states that leadership style has a positive effect on performance. produce a strong contribution in providing influence between leadership styles on employee performance. The results of research by Yammarino et al., (1993) proved that transformational leadership has a strong influence on employee performance compared to transactional leadership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hypothesis 4: Leadership style has a positive and significant effect on employee performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Organizational Culture and Employee Performances. Many studies have shown that there is a relationship between organizational culture and employee performance, one of which is research conducted by Syardiansah, et al. (2020), his research concluded that organizational culture has a positive and significant influence on employee performance. Furthermore, research conducted by Marsono (2015) stated that the results of statistical analysis indicate that organizational culture has a significant influence on employee performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hypothesis 5: Organizational culture has a positive and significant effect on employee performance.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>RESEARCH METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">Research to be conducted on the influence of the variables of information systems technology development, leadership style, organizational culture and employee performance in some of the largest tourism travel industries in Indonesia, where research is focused on one of the major provinces in Indonesia, namely South Sulawesi. The author uses this type of quantitative research based on several considerations, including in terms of the objective, namely to test the concept of theory, build a fact, prove the relationship and influence between variables, explain statistical descriptions, interpret and predict the results. In addition, in terms of data used by researchers, the data are statistical numbers or quantifiable data coding. This data is in the form of a variable and is operationalized with a size scale, namely the interval scale. The population in this study are all employees who work in the travel industry in South Sulawesi. From the detailed indicators on each variable will be added up to get a total of 28 (twenty eight) indicators which will be used by researchers in this study, then the number of samples which will be obtained is 28 multiplied by 5 which results in a total of 140 samples, so that the sample that the researcher will use in the data collection process through a questionnaire is 140 respondents. Data collection tools or research instruments that researchers will use in collecting data in the field are questionnaires. In this study, the analysis technique will be used Structural Equation Model or commonly known as SEM acronym.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">This finding is supported by the results of research conducted Budhi (2018) stated that after conducting the analysis the conclusion was that the use of technology had an effect on employee performance and organizational culture where the percentage produced was 78% organizational culture was influenced by technology, as well as technology affects employee performance by 95%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The results of this research are also in line with the research conducted by Ulva (2018) stated the influence of organizational culture on the success rate of implementing HRIS information systems is seen from the results of the t test, which is 3.237 where t is greater than t table 1.96, it can be said that organizational culture has a positive influence on the success of implementing HRIS information technology systems because organizational culture is now more oriented. on the results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The leadership style in this study as the independent variable (X2) consists of 4 (four) indicators, namely: Increasing employee confidence, creativity in fostering employees, motivating employees, personal attention to employees. The results of data analysis that were processed statistically showed that there was a positive and significant influence between leadership style on organizational culture. This shows that, the higher the influence of the leadership style applied by each tourism travel industry, the higher the role of organizational culture that applies in every travel industry in South Sulawesi, and vice versa if the influence of the leadership style applied in a travel industry company is low. , then automatically the organizational culture applied by the employees will also be lower. The results of this study are also consistent with research conducted by Suhana (2007) which examines the relationship between leadership style, organizational culture, commitment and performance. A significant relationship was found between leadership style and organizational culture, leadership style with commitment, and between organizational culture and performance. According to Schein (2004) Culture is created by leaders, while leaders are created by culture. Often research is conducted that the behavior of transformational leaders has a significant effect on organizational culture. According to Bass &amp;&nbsp;Avolio (1993), organizational culture is often the creation of its founders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The results of data analysis research by statistical means show that the development of information technology systems is significant and has a positive effect on employee performance in the travel industry in South Sulawesi. This can show that the more optimal the use of information technology systems in each tourism travel industry in South Sulawesi, the higher the performance of its employees, and vice versa, the worse the quality of the use of information technology systems, the lower the performance of employees in the travel industry in Sulawesi. South. The results of this study are reinforced by the opinion of expert researchers Nohria &amp;&nbsp;Gulati (1996) which states that technological progress has a close relationship with</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">employee performance. Likewise, the responses from Hitt et al., (1997) stated that technological progress is an important factor in influencing employee performance improvement. Most of the existing research results often show a positive relationship with technological advances with employee performance, and provide results that the development of information systems technology is important for employee performance (Foster, 1986).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In an international journal written by Imran (2014) states the technological advances, employees tend to be motivated to do their jobs by conducting more skills training and employee knowledge of more specific technology. In addition, the technological progress was designated as an independent variable and employee performance was the dependent variable and found that there was a significant relationship between the development of information systems technology and employee performance, meaning that when technology tended to advance, employee performance increased.</span></p>

This can show that the greater the influence of the leadership style applied to the travel industry in South Sulawesi, the higher the performance of the employees, and vice versa, the worse the effect of the transformational leadership style applied to the travel industry, the lower the employee performance. in the travel industry in South Sulawesi. The results of this study are in line with the results of research by Humphreys (2002) which proved the critical role of transformational leadership in improving employee performance. Bono &amp;&nbsp;Judge (2003) also found transformational leadership affects employee performance. Performance in Bono &amp;&nbsp;Judge (2003) study is measured from several aspects, so they conclude that transformational leadership will affect employee performance under any circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Bass et al., (2003) showed a strong influence between transformational leadership on employee performance compared to transactional leadership. Bass et al., (2003) explain that transformational leadership focuses on employee self-development, motivates employees to act and think innovatively in solving problems and achieving organizational goals and objectives, encouraging enthusiasm and optimism for a job so that employee performance often exceeds expectations. This condition is contrary to the transactional leadership style which is more concerned with targets based on the principle of exchange, which may actually have a negative impact in the long term.

The results of research by Yammarino et al., (1993) proved that transformational leadership has a strong influence on employee performance compared to transactional leadership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Organizational culture in this study as an independent variable (X3) consists of 5 (five) indicators, namely: Dare to innovate and take risks, Attention to work security procedures, Achievement of company vision and mission and career paths of employees and a compact work team. The results of the data analysis processed statistically show that there is a positive and significant influence between organizational culture on employee performance in the travel industry. This shows that, the higher the influence of organizational culture in each travel industry, the higher the employee's performance in each travel industry in South Sulawesi. Many studies have shown that there is a relationship between organizational culture and employee performance, one of which is research conducted by Porwani (2010) states organizational culture has a positive and significant influence on employee performance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Managerial advice in managing the travel industry business in South Sulawesi is that the quality of electronic services related to technological developments in the travel industry should get more serious attention from any management of the travel industry, because it affects not only customer decisions but also on employee performance, where these two things are the main goal of the company to be able to survive and exist in the midst of increasingly fierce competition in the world of the travel industry. The transformational leadership style adopted by the travel industry should be reviewed more seriously in its application in every travel industry, because it affects not only work culture but also employee performance, where these two things are the main goals of the company to survive and exist in the midst of competition. which is getting tougher in the world of the travel industry. The development of the information technology system that runs in every tourism travel industry should be optimized for its application in the travel company, because the benefits are not only for the work culture within the organization but also for future employee performance, where these two things are the main goals of the company to survive and exist amidst competition. which is getting tougher in the world of the travel industry. The leadership style applied by each travel industry in achieving goals so that employee performance can be improved should be evaluated better so that company goals can be achieved, namely improving employee performance, because the effect is not only on work culture but also on the satisfaction of customers who use services. From the travel industry, where these two things are the main goals of the company to be able to survive and exist in the midst of increasingly fierce competition in the world of the travel industry. The organizational culture applied by the travel industry should be the center of attention in its application in every tourism travel industry, because its influence is not only on work culture but also on employee performance, where these two things are the main goals of the company to be able to survive and exist amid increasingly competition. strict in the world of the travel industry.</span></p>
