<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Abstract</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The enactment of Presidential Regulation Number 20 of 2018 concerning the Use of Foreign Workers and Job Creation Law has triggered pros and cons. On the one hand, these arrangements define as advanced approach to increase investment in Indonesia and assist transfer knowledge that can be obtained from equipped foreign workers with their skills and technologies. There are substantial arrangements to ease foreign workers access under growth investment idea, facilitating business licensing through deregulation, and scrutinize legal provisions for foreign workers to be able to work in Indonesia. This article was aimed to analyze, and finding analysis of policy dynamics regulating the use of Foreign Workers in Indonesia, as well as the gaps of the use of Foreign Workers arrangement in the Job Creation Law. This article was normative legal research using statutory approach, and conceptual approach. The study indicated that the dynamics of regulation in various legal policies on the use of Foreign Workers especially between Law on Employment and Law on Job Creation, even though there are fields and types of work that are also required to prioritize Indonesian Workers, along with the use of Foreign Workers to a certain time limit to adopt Foreign Workers skills. The prospective policy direction through this article is expected to be more selective policy in the context of utilization of foreign workers, state protection, and adequate improvement quality/standard of competence for Indonesian workers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The essence of state intervention to protect their local workers, as derivate from welfare state concept grounded with opportunity equality, wealth distribution, and public responsibility to the poor people for access to the adequate life standard,<sup>1</sup> as well as</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">social welfare, economic welfare, and state welfare.<sup>2</sup> Based on this concept, Indonesia also considers welfare state as inseparable part of national purpose that regulates in the Fourth Paragraph of the 1945 Indonesia Constitution Preamble. This arrangement was recognize welfare state as a state fundamental instrument,<sup>3</sup> people prosperous consideration,<sup>4</sup> and legal ground for national development with active role from state to implement national development agenda,<sup>5</sup> also in government protection and their partiality to the Indonesia workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Legal protection for Indonesia workers is considered as constitutional obligation,<sup>6 </sup>especially in the Article 27 Paragraph (2) the 1945 Indonesia Constitution that recognize state to ensure right for citizen to their works and adequate life within humanity values. Recently, globalization and the 4.0 Industrial Revolution shift and accelerate investment, labor migration, and free trade between states causes rapid foreign workers employed by any companies around world.<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Global development demands any countries in the world, both developed or developing countries to compete for their competitiveness in global arena, several approaches was implemented by any countries, especially developing countries deregulate and tackle any obstacles to the ease of foreign workers employ with aims to accelerate national development. It means that manpower issues have importance and fundamentally affected any national development schemes towards welfare and prosperity.<sup>8</sup> The use of foreign workers as critical issues that facing by any countries in the world, including Indonesia, as the consequences became international trade community members, like World Trade Organization (WTO), ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA) and ASEAN Economic Community (MEA), every countries should ease of foreign workers access to national job fields, and create free competition between local workers with foreign workers to any job positions. This issue was raises and agreed in regional level, ASEAN has been declared the Cebu Declaration on the Acceleration of the Establishment of an ASEAN Community in 2015, ASEAN state members should be implementing ASEAN Economic Community framework into four pillars of AEC blueprint, in this context, the ease of foreign workers in ASEAN territories following first pillars called as Single Market and Production, in the Core</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Elements A.5., every ASEAN members should be ensuring free flows of skilled labor, including to facilitate movement of skilled labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on several data that compiled by civil society organization and government data showing that the number of foreign workers in Indonesia reach 92.058 workers until May 2021,<sup>9</sup> if compared with 2020, there is decreasing caused by Covid-19 pandemic, in 2020, foreign workers number in Indonesia reach 98.902 workers from any countries, with the five largest number was contributed by China (35.781 workers or equal with 36,17%), Japan (12.823 workers), South Korea (9.097 workers), India (7.356 workers), and Malaysia (4.816 workers).<sup>10</sup> According to these data, it determines almost foreign workers in Indonesia were employed with higher position that local workers like professional, manager, commissioner, consultant, and technician.<sup>11</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Regarding foreign workers employ arrangement, the Indonesia Government was regulating this matters starting with Law on Foreign Workers Placement 1958, Law on Employment 1997, and Law on Employment (Law Number 13 of 2003) with specific regulations as derivation from the Law on Employment 2003. This Law was enacted as the part of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reformasi,</span><span class="font2"> with aims to recognize workers role in national development, and their important role or position to accelerate national agenda.<sup>12</sup> The local workers protection is to ensure basic rights of workers, equality work opportunities, non-discriminative act in any forms to themselves and their families prosperity, while still encourage business and industries interest.<sup>13</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Law on Employment 2003, especially in the Chapter III concerning Equal Opportunities and Treatment, in Article 5 and 6 regulates that every Indonesian has equal opportunities to gain their job and equal treatment in their job.<sup>14</sup> The Elucidation of the Law on Employment 2003 also stresses these arrangements, in relations with non-discriminatory treatment to everyone in workers recruitments, because Indonesia as diversity nations should be strengthened based on unity and respect diversity. This principle is cannot to be apply for foreign workers, because there is obligations both government and business sector prioritizing local workers to work in Indonesia and prosper their country.<sup>15</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Foreign workers arrangement was regulates since enactment of Law on Foreign Workers Placement (Law Number 3 of 1958), then it was revoked and regulates in further with special chapter in Law on Employment 2003 (Chapter VIII concerning the Use of Foreign Workers, in the Article 42 until Article 49). The Article 42 Paragraph (1) Law on Employment 2003 specifically arranged that every employer who employed foreign workers shall have written permit from Minister or appointed officers. This arrangement was requirement for employer, when foreign workers was employed should not cause negative impact especially in security and reduced work opportunity for Indonesian workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The use of foreign workers implicated new capital flows, new investment opportunity,<sup>16</sup> and sharing or transfer of knowledge with their developed know how and skills.<sup>17</sup> The work fields or types also should prioritize Indonesia workers and use foreign workers until certain time limit until Indonesia workers could adopt their skills or any knowledge, and the use of foreign workers should be selective in terms of Indonesian workers empowerment</span><span class="font1"><sup>18</sup></span><span class="font2">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Previous researches that conducted by others just specifically focus on one terms or substance in arrangement of foreign workers, Jazuli Ahmad explained that the foreign workers existence in Indonesia shift social polemic especially after enactment of Presidential Regulation Number 20 of 2018 concerning the Use of Foreign Workers, that philosophically to ease investment flows in Indonesia caused by rapid foreign workers flows in Indonesia after enactment of this Presidential Regulation.<sup>19</sup> Djazuli revealed that foreign worker permit was scrutinized by the arrangement Article 9, Article 10 Paragraph (1), Article 19, and Article 26 of this Presidential Regulation with aims to ease foreign workers access to Indonesia job fields and it is contrary with Law on Employment 2003.<sup>20</sup> While this Law also paid attention and criticized by any social holders worrying, as explained by Pottag, the foreign workers could reduce significantly job fields for Indonesia workers.<sup>21</sup> Djulius also revealed it was widely spread new gap between local and foreign workers caused by investment and transfer of technology flows.<sup>22</sup> Hence, these controversial arrangements was strengthened with Minister of Manpower Regulation Number 10 of 2018 concerning the Procedure of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Use of Foreign Workers that also widely criticized, that there is unclear mechanism to supervise foreign workers both in their numbers and existence in Indonesia.<sup>23</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The debate to justifying ease of foreign workers access in Indonesia could be determined starting from statutory laws validity, as the consequence of arrangement Article 1 Paragraph (3) the 1945 Indonesia Constitution, that Indonesia as the rule of law state, the written regulations should be used to regulate and create social order.<sup>24 </sup>This is in line with Gustav Radbruch as quoted by Mawar and Bohlander, validity is the main principles for any regulations to be enter into force,<sup>25</sup> it is should be reflects justice, legal benefits </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(zweckmaszigkeit</span><span class="font2">), and legal certainty as basic values of law,<sup>26</sup> that reflected in statutory laws considerations.<sup>27</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By referring to the applicability of the law essence, this article contributes to be argumentative analytical frameworks related with legal policy dynamics of the use of foreign workers, since the enactment Law on Employment 2003, Presidential Regulation Number 20 of 2018, and drastic reformulation by enactment of Law on Job Creation (Law Number 11 of 2020), that enacted to create widely investment in Indonesia, with revoking several articles in the Law on Employment that shift ease of foreign workers in Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on legal background that explained earlier, this article focus on two legal issues that study, analyze, and find argumentation related with </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">first, </span><span class="font2">how legal policy arrangement dynamics regarding the use of foreign workers in Indonesia?, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">second, </span><span class="font2">how about consideration and reformulation of the use of foreign workers in the Law on Employment after enactment of the Law on Job Creation?</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">This article was researched with portraying itself as a legal research, based on normative legal research or doctrinal legal research that placing law as prescriptive discipline<sup>28</sup> and also focusing on law as norms system or statutory laws.<sup>29</sup> It is strengthened with primary and secondary legal materials and informative legal materials. The discussion on two main issues in this article based on three approaches that used including statutory law approach, and conceptual approach. The legal materials collected with literature and documents study, and it is analyzed to create</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">problem solving description, legal materials systematization, interpretation, evaluation of research results, and legal argumentation towards two main issues that carried in this article, the results of this research was created into argumentative analytic descriptive article.<sup>30</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The study of legal policy arrangement in this article cannot be separated with stage that provided to evaluate public policy.<sup>31</sup> It is related with public policy making process that recognized by any academicians and practitioner as a complex process that including some processes and related variable, and it should be analyzed in comprehensive manner</span><span class="font1"><sup>32</sup></span><span class="font2">. William N. Dunn revealed that there are five main stages in public policy making process, are agenda arrangement stage, policy formulation stage, policy adoption stage, policy implementation stage, and policy evaluation stage.<sup>33</sup> In this article, the legal policy arrangement dynamics was examined with policy evaluation stage, that any implemented policy are evaluate to showing policy impact with goals or agenda setting, solving problem that faced by peoples cause by policy implementation with any measurements or criteria as the ground to examine the policy is impacting or not based fixed government goals.<sup>34</sup> In this context, the evaluation is conducted to the any public policy making process stages, so policy evaluation including policy substance, policy implementation and policy impact, and further government action that should be taken, whether postponement, revoking, reformulation or amending any policies.<sup>35</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The foreign workers policy evaluation could be examined starting from </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">first, </span><span class="font2">the specification as an important sub-activity regarding the way to examine or deciding “benefit” from any policies. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Second, </span><span class="font2">the measurement including collecting relevant and valid information for evaluation purpose, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">third, </span><span class="font2">the analysis as the sub-activity that focusing to the information adsorption and usage that collected to create conclusion that reflected government openness, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">fourth, </span><span class="font2">the recommendation as the final sub-activity to determine further action that should be taken and also reflects</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">government openness.<sup>36</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In broader context, the policy evaluation that used in this article to examine the dynamics of legal policy regarding the use of foreign workers in Indonesia, that used as analysis and procedural tools to the problematic issues regarding foreign workers access in Indonesia. It also determine with evaluative research that investigate policy program and anything behind policy problems to collect information and examine policy both in process and results, and policy cycle that supported information report that used in policy making process.<sup>37</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The use of foreign workers arrangement in Indonesia cannot be separated with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">wetgeving</span><span class="font2"> as explained by A. Hamid S. Attamimi with quoting Legal Dictionary </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fockema Andreae</span><span class="font2">, that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">wetgeving</span><span class="font2"> as (a) the act to making state regulations in central or regional level based on the statutory law making procedures; and (b) all of state regulations in the central and regional level, that called as statutory laws, that reflected as (a) legal norms (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rechtsnormen</span><span class="font2">); (b) externally in scope (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">naar buiten werken</span><span class="font2">); and (c) general in broader context (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">algemeenheid in ruime zin</span><span class="font2">).<sup>38</sup> However, in this article, the legal policy arrangement dynamics regarding the use of foreign workers in Indonesia should be understood as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">wetgeving</span><span class="font2"> with statutory laws context related with the use of foreign workers in Indonesia.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consideration and Problem in the Use of Foreign Workers Arrangement after enactment Law on Job Creation</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Article 28D paragraph (2) of the 1945 Indonesia Constitution has been affirmed constitutional rights for everyone both in the context right to work (non-discriminatory treatment based on religion, ethnicity, and others), and rights in work (concretization and implementation of normative rights for workers)</span><span class="font1"><sup>45</sup></span><span class="font2">, with aims to be legal framework for state and business sector obligation to provide further access and to protect Indonesia workers. Recently, also there are dynamics and debate after enactment Law on Job Creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Law on Job Creation enactment understood as legal breakthrough and controversial Law caused by any formal and material problem that raises due the legislative process of this Law, including minimum efforts by People Representative Council (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">DPR</span><span class="font2">) to socialize all relevant documents and minutes due drafting process or final draft of the Law on Job Creation. Both Parliament and President partially</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">evaluate omnibus method to be implemented in the national statutory law making, and there is general thought that Parliament and President suspended all legislative agenda cause the failure to create maximum public participation during Covid-19 pandemic,<sup>46</sup> and these process could be determined as spontaneous,<sup>47</sup> to draft and discuss legal substance of the Law on Job Creation that discussed and passed by Parliament,<sup>48</sup> until enter into force in early November 2020<sup>49</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the most crucial issues raise after enactment the Law on Job Creation is related with manpower issues, including the use of foreign workers. However, there is need to examine any considerations that raises to rearrange the use of foreign workers with main idea to ease foreign workers access to be employed by Employer in any work fields in Indonesia, accelerate investment, and tackling any problem to implement ease of doing business. It can be examined based on legal political perspective,<sup>50</sup> both from policy stratification in the statutory laws or considerations, general explanation, authentic minutes, authentic documents during law making process was held. These sources could be used to determined basic policy and enactment policy from the Law on Job Creation. This is cannot be separated with fundamental position of the five principles “Pancasila” as the national legal ideas to implement national development goals,<sup>51</sup> as well as revoking old laws and creating new laws that reflected Pancasila values,<sup>52</sup> and establish strong foundation for national law system could be optimized implemented national ideas.<sup>53</sup> In this context, the use of foreign workers as stipulates in the Law on Job Creation could be determined based on legal political behind the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">norms arrangements of this issue,<sup>54</sup> especially in the Article 42 to Article 49 Law on Employment 2003 that amended in the Law on Job Creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">First, </span><span class="font2">the Article 42 of the Law on Employment 2003 amendment as stipulates in the Article 81 number (4) Law on Job Creation, philosophically, it is arranged with aims to create legal certainty to Employer who employing foreign workers in the context of accelerate ease of doing business, ease of permit to use foreign workers, including for any Risk Based Activity Cluster (Sector Permits).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Second, </span><span class="font2">the rearrangement of the Article 42 Law on Employment 2003 in broader context by the Article 81 number (4) Law on Job Creation is based on the previous regulation (Presidential Regulation Number 20 of 2018), for example, the Article 7 paragraph (1) regulating the Employer who employing foreign workers should have approved and valid Plan/RPTKA, Article 17 paragraph (1) that revoke the Permit for the Use of Foreign Workers (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">IMTA</span><span class="font2">), every foreign workers should have Temporary Permit (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">VITAS</span><span class="font2">), and the Employer should have the Plan (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">RPTKA</span><span class="font2">), with exception for shareholders, diplomatic and consular officers, and special job fields that needed by Government. In this Law, there is amendment to the delegating norms for further arrangement of the use of foreign workers, from Presidential Regulation became Government Regulation, and the affirmation for positive contribution to boost investment growth, and create new job fields for Indonesia workers.<sup>55</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Third, </span><span class="font2">the recognition towards Employer obligation as regulates in the Article 45 Law on Employment 2003 after amended in the Article 81 number (7) Law on Job Creation, interestingly, this provision was changing from previous version until enacted version, especially debate that raises with arrangement administrative sanctions for any violations conducted by Employer as regulates in the Article 6 paragraph (1)-(3), Article 7 paragraph (1)-(2), Article 8 paragraph (1)-(2), Article 9, Article 10, and Article 11 paragraph (1)-(2) Government Regulation Number 34 of 2021. It is also strengthened with Chapter VII concerning Administrative Sanctions and Article 19 paragraph (6), Article 23 paragraph (1), Article 32 paragraph (1)-(3) Government Regulation Number 34 of 2021, with penalty form; temporary suspension from approval application process; and revoking the Approval of the Use of Foreign Workers Plan (Article 36 paragraph (1)-(3); Article 37 paragraph (1)-(5); Article 38 paragraph (1)-(4); Article 39 paragraph (1)-(4); Article 40 and Article 41).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Fourth, </span><span class="font2">related with further arrangement as derivation of the Law on Job Creation, in the previous bill,<sup>56</sup> the government still defending the use Presidential Regulation, in this context, the Presidential Regulation Number 20 of 2018 concerning the Use of Foreign Workers. According to statutory law theories, the use of Presidential Regulation raise legal problem. The Presidential Regulation has “rule” character to shaping “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">regeling</span><span class="font2">” with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dauerhaftig</span><span class="font2"> character, and according to the Article 4 Paragraph</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the 1945 Indonesia Constitution, this form is related with Presidential authorities within governance context. Hence, the Presidential Regulation has legal substance to implement delegating norm from higher statutory law or conducting government activities in the Presidential domain, as practiced with Presidential Decree in other countries, like US and others.<sup>57</sup> The Presidential Regulation was created both in the context </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">concentration of power and responsibility upon the President</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">delegated legislation </span><span class="font2">according to the higher statutory laws including the 1945 Indonesia Constitution, Laws, or Government Regulation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Based on theoretical framework as explained earlier, the Article 49 Law on Employment 2003 as amended by the Article 81 number Law on Job Creation that regulates further arrangement or delegated regulation with Government Regulation Number 34 of 2021 that enter into force in April, 1<sup>st</sup>, 2021 (Article 48), and revoking Presidential Regulation Number 20 of 2018 (Article 46). Theoretically, this arrangement with Government Regulation form was justified because it cannot be separated with the Article 5 paragraph (2) the 1945 Indonesia Constitution that the President could enact Government Regulation as derivation of the Laws or conducting government activities. It is also related with basic substances of Government Regulation, including </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">first, </span><span class="font2">the Government Regulation cannot be enacted before the primary arrangement in the Law forms was enter into force; </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">second, </span><span class="font2">the Government Regulation cannot regulates criminal sanctions if the Law does not regulates this sanctions; </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">third, </span><span class="font2">the Government Regulation cannot amended or revoking any provisions that stipulates in the Law; </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">fourth, </span><span class="font2">the Government Regulation can be arranged to regulates government activities while there is none Law clearly delegates it; and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">fifth, </span><span class="font2">the Government Regulation substances including </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">regeling</span><span class="font2"> or combination of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">regeling</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">beschikking</span><span class="font2">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In fact, the use of foreign workers arrangement in the Law on Employment 2003 that amended by the Law on Job Creation, in the one hand, follows rapid globalization in recent decades that shift any countries to integrate global market and increasing global leadership role. It is also similarly with any other Southeastern Asia countries, besides Indonesia, these countries also facing the needs to increase economic strategy with light export industrialization, shift strategic role of workers number with low salaries, increasing investment,<sup>58</sup> while any global obstacles to boost domestic market, none countries could prevent rapid flows of foreign workers as residual effects from theses condition.<sup>59</sup> The ease of foreign workers to gain broader opportunity in Indonesia raise serious problem for Indonesia workers, and it seems losing justice for local workers with pragmatism attempts by Government under business-friendly-flexible orientation.<sup>60</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Law on Job Creation just normatively calling for Indonesian workers protection, however, it is not reflect any essence to implement Government attempts to protect local workers, with more liberally to diminish market obstacles, open new foreign workers flows, while in partial context, any minimum attempts to equipping local workers was realized, and in philosophical context, the purpose to boost transfer of technology and knowledge and gain effective national rapid development just not more than legalistic perspective from Government and Parliament after Law on Job Creation enactment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is need in future to create new Manpower legal framework that strictly protect Indonesia worker rights, while the opportunity for foreign workers still be defended, the broader job fields for Indonesian should be fulfilled both in regulations and business treatment. In further, the implementation of Law on Job Creation should be prevented from unequal condition between local workers and foreign workers, the rapid flows of investment should be respecting local workers, especially for broader opportunity for transfer of knowledge/skills/knowledge, permitted job fields or exception job fields for foreign workers, and implementation of education and training for Indonesia workers to increase their competences according to the work field needs.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the abovementioned, it can be concluded that the dynamics legal policy regarding the use of foreign workers should be understood with arrangement context of statutory laws products. There is reframing and rearrangement with enactment Law on Employment 2003, Presidential Regulation Number 20 of 2018, Minister of Manpower Regulation Number 10 of 2018, that became controversial and debatable regulations cause any provisions was contrary with the Law on Employment 2003. The recent problem also raises caused by the enactment the Law on Job Creation 2020 that revised and revoked any provisions of the Law on Employment 2003, and Government Regulation Number 34 of 2021 enactment also became more radical arrangement to ease foreign workers access to the Indonesia job fields. Furthermore, Law on Job Creation that amending Article 42 until Article 49 Law on Employment 2003 into Article 81 number (4) Law on Job Creation, that revoking any provisions of the Article 43, Article 44, Article 46, and Article 48 Law on Employment 2003 by the Article 81 number (5), Article 81 number (6), Article 81 number (8), and Article 81 number (10) Law on Job Creation. This rearrangement was created to implement legal certainty for Employer in the context to boost ease doing business, ease of permit to use foreign workers including Risk-based Business Activity cluster (Sector Permit), and lead positive contribution in accelerating investment growth, including create new and expanded job fields and opportunities for Indonesia workers</span></p>
