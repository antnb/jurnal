<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstrak</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Studi ini berjudul “The Types of Idiom and Their Meaning in Maroon 5’s Hands All Over Album”. Data dari studi ini diambil dari album Maroon 5 yang berjudul “hands All Over”. Studi ini menganalisis dan menentukan jenis-jenis idiom beserta makna dari masing-masing idiom tersebut. Pemilihan studi tentang idiom ini didasarkan karena penentuan makna dari tiap ungkapan tidak bisa hanya mengartikan ungkapan tersebut secara harfiah, melainkan membutuhkan penalaran makna secara menyeluruh dari isi lagu tersebut. Ada dua teori yang digunakan dalam studi ini, yakni teori jenis-jenis ungkapan oleh Palmer yang diambil dari ‘Semantic: a New Outline” (1976) dan juga teori makna oleh Leech, Meaning and English Verb (1985). Ditemukan 2 jenis idiom di dalam album yang telah di analisis, mereka adalah prepositional verb dan partial idiom, sedangkan jenis makna yang ditemukan hanya conceptual meaning, affective meaning dan connotative meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kata kunci: bahasa figuratif, idiom, ekspresi ungkapan</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of The Study</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Many people are often confused when they are listening to song in English expression; there are some expressions whose meanings are not easy to be interpreted. Even though they understand every single of the words, but it is still difficult to grasp what the sentence means. Those expressions could be idioms. Idioms are expressions of at least two words which cannot be understood literally and which function as a semantic (Larson: 1984). It means an idiom is a number of words which are joined together, which means something different from the meaning of the separate words that make them up. In general, idioms can be classified into phrasal verb, prepositional phrase and partial idiom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Being interested in the study of idioms especially the idioms that can be found in the song lyrics, this study analyzes the idioms used particularly in the song lyrics of Maroon 5, the song was taken from their album “</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hands All Over”</span><span class="font0">. The theme of the song written by Maroon 5 is about love. In writing a song, Maroon 5 used many figurative languages including the idiom to express his feeling about pain and love around him, and some of his song is to express admiration to legendary Mick Jagger.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The analysis in this study starts with the types of idiom first and then followed by the analysis of their meaning. The analysis of idioms found in this album are hoped to answer the problems about the types of idioms and the meaning of idiomatic expressions found in the song lyrics of this album.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Analysis of The Types of Idioms Found in Maroon </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">5’s Hands All Over</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Album</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">According to Palmer in his book: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Semantic: A New Outline</span><span class="font0"> (1976), idioms could be divided into three types: phrasal verb, prepositional verb, and partial idiom. But in this analysis, only two types of idioms are analyzed since they are the most common idioms occurs in this study. They are prepositional verbs and partial idioms. The idioms below were taken from the selected song lyrics of Maroon 5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepositional Verb</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">A prepositional verb is a group of multi-word verbs composed from a verb plus another word or words. Many people refer to all multi-word verbs as phrasal verbs.. It’s the sequences of verb plus adverb and there are also the sequences of verb plus preposition, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">go for</span><span class="font0"> which means attack and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">look after</span><span class="font0"> which means care. The examples of verb, adverb and preposition are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">‘put up with’</span><span class="font0"> which means tolerate and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">‘do away’</span><span class="font0"> which mean killing. Those words are not fixed collocation idioms so that they cannot stand alone, they need to be followed by a complete sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are several prepositional verbs found in this album, as follows: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">falling in, walking down, go ahead, looking for, look in, knock on, laying in, turn around, get along, move on,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">look into.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partial Idiom</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Partial idiom is an idiom in which one of the words has its usual meaning; the other has a meaning that is peculiar to the particular sequence. We can find an example in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">red hair</span><span class="font0"> which refers to hair, but not hair that is red in strict color terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There were thirtteen partial idioms found in this album, such as : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">your faith is shakin’</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">you were wrong for turning me on</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a fantasy girl</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hard time in proving you right</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">perfection on your face</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the bitter chill of winter, put your hands all over me</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cut out all the noise, your whisper so clear</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lying in the dark no sunshine</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">at 4am when the sweats set in</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">storm brewing in his eyes</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">take me by the tongue</span><span class="font0">.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>5. 2 The Analysis of Meaning of Each Idiom Found in Maroon 5’s Hands All Over Album.</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">After the types of idiom have been analyzed, the analysis would be continued to their meaning. The theory used is the theory of meaning proposed by Leech (1974) which is conceptual meaning, connotative meaning, stylistic meaning, affective meaning, reflective meaning, collocative meaning, and thematic meaning. But there were only three</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">idioms that are applicable in this study, such as : conceptual meaning, connotative meaning, and affective meaning.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conceptual Meaning</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">The Conceptual meaning (sometimes called ‘denotative’ or ‘cognitive’ meaning) is widely assumed to be the central factor in linguistic communication. Conceptual meaning deals with the core meaning of expression. It is the denotative or literal meaning. It is essential for the functional language. For example, a part of the conceptual meaning of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Needle” may be “thin”, “sharp” or “instrument”</span><span class="font0">. The conceptual meaning is the base for all the other types of meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are seven expression that could be classified as conceptual meaning, they were : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">look into, waiting for, falling in, turn around, laying on, get in, and look in.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affective Meaning</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Affective meaning is a sort of meaning which can reflect the personal feelings of the speakers, including his attitude to the listener, or his attitude to something he is talking about. For example </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">You’re a vicious tyrant and villainous reprobate, and I hate you for it!</span><span class="font0"> (Leech, 1974:18). Someone who is addressed with the previous example, without much doubt, understand about the feeling of the speaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is only one expression that suit affective meaning, that is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">put your hands all over me.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connotative Meaning</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Connotative meaning is the communicative value an expression has by virtue of what it </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">refers to</span><span class="font0">, over and above its purely conceptual content. It is something that goes beyond mere referent of a word and hints at its attributes in the real world. Thus purely conceptual content of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">‘woman’ is + human + female + adult </span><span class="font0">but the psychological connotations could be </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">‘gregarious’, having maternal instinct’ </span><span class="font0">or typical attributes of</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark31"></a>womanhood such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">‘babbling’, ‘experienced in cookery’, ‘skirt or dress wearing’</span><span class="font0">, etc.</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">Connotative meaning is the most common type of meaning that occured, since most idioms cannot be predicted by looking up the literal meaning, such as: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">your faith is shakin’</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">you were wrong for turning me on</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a fantasy girl</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hard time in proving you right</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">perfection on your face</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the bitter chill of winter, out all the noise, your whisper so clear</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lying in the dark no sunshine</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">at 4am when the sweats set in</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">storm brewing in his eyes</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">take me by the tongue, etc.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Based on the analysis in the previous chapter, it could be concluded that Maroon 5’s album entitled “Hands All Over” have been composed using some idioms. Among the thirteen songs in the album, there are some idioms which could be found in each single song. There are two types of idiom found after analyzing data. They are prepositional verb and partial idiom. Preposotional verb includes the combination of verb plus preposition which was found in each of this album songs except in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Never Gonna Leave This Bed.</span><span class="font0"> The prepositional verbs found in the song lyrics totaled thirteen prepositional verbs, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">laying on, falling in, walking down, go ahead, looking for, fall into, look in, laying in, turn around, get along, move on, look into,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">get in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The second type of idiom is partial idiom. Partial idiom is an idiom in which one has its usual meaning, while the other has the meaning that is peculiar to a particular sequence. The partial idiom found in the song lyrics totaled thirteen partial idioms, such as : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">your faith is shakin’</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">you were wrong for turning me on</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a fantasy girl</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hard time in proving you right</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">perfection on your face</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the bitter chill of winter, put your hands all over me</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cut out all the noise, your whisper so clear</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lying in the dark no sunshine</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">at 4am when the sweats set in</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">storm brewing in his eyes</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">take me by the tongue</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Maroon 5’s song lyrics, based on the theory of meaning, there were only three meanings of idioms applicable in this study; They are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">conceptual meaning, affective meaning, and connotative meaning.</span><span class="font0"> There were eight expressions that could be classified as conceptual meaning, they are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">: look into, waiting for, falling in, knock on, turn around, laying on, get in,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">look in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">According to the meaning analysis, there is only one expression that suit affective meaning, that is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">put your hands all over me</span><span class="font0">. The connotative meaning is the most common type of meaning that occurs, since most of idiomatic expressions cannot be predicted by looking up the literal meaning of the words into the dictionary. For example: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">your faith is shakin’</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">you were wrong for turning me on</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a fantasy girl</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hard time in proving you right</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">perfection on your face</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the bitter chill of winter, out all the noise, your whisper so clear</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lying in the dark no sunshine</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">at 4am when the sweats set in</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">storm brewing in his eyes</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">take me by the tongue, etc.</span></p>
