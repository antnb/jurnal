<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Penelitian ini berjudul The Psycholgical Comparisons between Protagonist and Antagonist to Affect the Plot of Christie’s Novel “Curtain”. Permasalahan dalam penelitian ini adalah membahas tentang perbedaan secara psikologi antara tokoh protagonis dan antagonis dan bagaimana hal tersebut mempengaruhi alur cerita dari novel tersebut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Metode penelitian yang digunakan untuk mengumpulkan data adalah metode dokumentasi yang berarti data dikumpulkan melalui membaca dan mencatat data yang akan dianalisis. Metode ini terdiri dari beberapa teknik, diantaranya adalah membaca novel secara keseluruhan, kemudian mengumpulkan data yang termasuk dalam aspek secara psikologis, lalu mencatatnya, setelah itu data yang terkumpul digolongkan sesuai dengan jenis-jenisnya. Teori yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah teori dari Allport (1921) yang mengklasifikasikan sifat menjadi tiga jenis yaitu cardinal, central dan secondary. Sifat Cardinal disini adalah sifat yang dianggap paling mendominasi kepribadian seseorang, sifat central adalah sifat yang membentuk kepribadian seseorang secara umum, sifat secondary adalah sifat yang dapat mengikuti atau beradaptasi dengan pengaruh lingkungan dan situasi sekeliling. Selain teori Allport, teori dari Stanton (1965), Ephron (2012) dan Rusell dan Winterbottom (2008) juga digunakan dalam menganalisa pengaruh terhadap alur cerita. Stanton menyatakan bahwa alur cerita merupakan rangkaian dari beberapa kejadian. Kejadian-kejadian tersebut tidak hanya melibatkan fisik namun juga perubahan perilaku tokoh dan keputusan mereka. Ephron menjelaskan bahwa plot selalu terdiri atas tiga unsur penting, yaitu tujuan, rintangan dan jalan keluar. Sedangkan Rusell dan Winterbottom menjelaskan tentang alur cerita yang terbalik dan mengejutkan pada bagian akhir. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Known as the queen of mystery, Dame Agatha Christie successfully created Hercule</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Poirot as the well-known detective. Unlike the other detectives, Christie wants to show</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">that sometimes more psychological needed in order to reveal a case rather than a physical act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Poirot is a person who will prefer to sit down and think about all the facts he knows rather than moving around in undercover and looking for clues. And in the real life, police and detectives do know that they also need the psychological aspect in their job. The criminal nowdays do improve their ability, doing the crime calmly, try not to leave any clues and prints and sometimes, they one step ahead from the officers. In the last case of Poirot, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cu rtain</span><span class="font2"> , Christie gave our little belgian detective a very equally rival. Why he is an equally rival for Poirot for he is also a person who know how to use psychology in right way, especially in manipulating people. That is why it is very suitable to choose this title to be discussed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Hercule Poirot is the protagonist character in this novel because just like another protagonist character, Poirot is the hero who would save the day. Surely, as the protagonist character, he is always right and will always win.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Stephen Norton is the antagonist characters in this novel because he is the troublemaker and the one who against Poirot as the protagonist. Like what Dunne said: this antagonist character actually represents the protagonist’s greatest fear because the protagonist sees so much of himself in the antagonist and it scare and weakens him. (Dunne, 20017:29).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Though he is weak physically, he is confident enough that his mind is still in the same power as before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“But certainly I mean it. For what other reason did I urge you to join me? My limbs, they are no longer active, but my brains, as i told you, is unimpaired.” </span><span class="font2">(Curtain, 1998: 7)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Based on the Traits theory of Allport’s, the data was selected then be analyzed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cardinal trait: </span><span class="font2">Traits that dominate an individual’s whole life, often to the point that the person becomes known specifically for these traits. People with such personalities often become so known for these traits that their names are often synonymous with these qualities. Allport suggested that cardinal traits are rare and tend to develop later in life. The example for this trait such as: womanizer, sadism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Central trait: These general characteristics form the foundations of personality. These central traits, while not as dominating as cardinal traits, are the major characteristics you</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">might use to describe another person. Terms such as intelligent, honest, shy and anxious are considered as central traits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Secondary trait: These traits are sometimes related to attitudes or preferences and often appear only in certain situations or under specific circumstances. Some examples would be getting anxious when speaking to a group or impatient while waiting in line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Secondary trait are less important, more difficult to detect tarits, “aroused by a narrower range of equivalent stimuli and they issue into a narrower range of equivalent responses” (Allport, 1937:338).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Effects on the Plot</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Those traits above shaped the character and the way of thinking of Poirot and Norton. With the comparisons appeared, they showed the different response when they faced the problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are two cases of murder and two cases of attempting for murder where appeared in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Curtain</span><span class="font2">. The first was the death of Barbara Frankin and the seond was the death of Stephen Norton. In Barbara Franklin case, Norton did not take any part in it for it is actually an accidential death. As for the second case, it was Poirot who decided to kill Norton by himself. Here we can see how the trait affected Poirot behaviours, his mind and his decision. He has arrogant as he cardinal trait and all people who know Poirot would describe him as an arrogant old man. And this trait of arrogant led him to think that the only one who could stop Norton is he. This arrogant trait caused him to be a murderer at the last, very unpleasant ending for a famouse detective who appreciated humans life so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“I could do it – and I was probably the only person who could.”</span><span class="font2"> (Curtain, 1998 : 117) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“By taking Norton’s life, I have saved other lives – innocent lives.”</span><span class="font2">(Curtain, 1998 : 120) The modest, good listeners, and sympathyc personality of Norton made people liked him but without noticing him very much at the same time. This led him to believe that he would never been caught, for he was unguilty before the law. There were no proves to prove that he was guilty and responsible for the murders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is just like what stated by Stanton, that the events may include not only physical occurrence, but also a character’s change of attitude, a flash of insight, and a decision</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(1965:14). In this case, the events of the plot show how Poirot change his attitude and how he made his decision. Norton also decided to meet and talk with Poirot personaly. It is also like what Eprhon has stated about the three key elements in plot.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A goal: the goal of the story is to show the outstanding ability of Hercule Poirot for the last time before he died. To reach this goal, Christie show clearly the main trait or the cardinal trait of Poirot: his arrogancy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obstacle to be overcome: there are many obstacles for Poirot to overcome in this story in order to catch Norton. In this part, the traits of the protagonist and antagonist also affected the level of the obstacle. If Norton is the type of person who is arrogant and take much attention, it would not that hard for Poirot to recognize that he is the murderer in a glance. But Norton is someone modest and shy, people would not give too much attention on him and it made people easily forget about Norton,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An outcome: at the end he decided to meet and talked with Norton personaly. The confidence traits that belong to both of this character make this event possible. If Norton has no such confidence, he would find a reason so he would not talk to Poirot personally. It is not that hard for Norton to avoid Poirot if he wants, but he is confident enough to face Poirot face to face in Poirot’s room. If Poirot has no such confidence, he would not straightly point Norton as the murderer and invite him to have a private conversation with him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">It proves that it is true as Eprhon said that in the mystery genre, the plot would take the main character from puzzle to solution, from confusion to knowledge (Ephron, 2012). At the beginning Poirot still puzzles about Norton. The motive, the method to select the target, the way he think, everything is still confusing. There are pieces that Poirot know already, but he has to put it in the right place, just like playing the puzzle; put the pieces in the right place to see the big picture. But at the end, all the things became clear and perfectly fit in it place. No more confusing things, all the hanging question been answered, the case was solved and the plot complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is also a good example of how the recognition accompanied with peripeteia or twisted ending. Rusell and Winterbottom stated that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">...for recognition accompanied by peripeteia in this way will involve either pity or fear, and tragedy is by definition a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mimesis</span><span class="font2"> of action that rouse these emotion; it is moreover such recognition that lead to good or bad fortune. (Rusell &amp;&nbsp;Winterbottom, 2008: 65)</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">After analyizing the psychological comparison between Poirot and Norton, some of the statements below can be drawn as conclusion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The cardinal traits is the most infuencing traits in human life. Poirot ended his life and career as the murderer because his ego and arrogance did not allow him to believe that there is no one else but he himself could stop Norton. And Norton sadistic resulted him being addicted to keep influencing people for doing the things he wants them to do. The traits of the protagonist and antagonist affected the plot of the story because their traits affected their acts and their acts influence the whole plot in the story. The type of the mystery plot is always puzzling in the beginning and become clear at the end, no question left unaswered. Arrogant gives nothing good in life. Poirot is an honor and humane detective for all of his history, but his arrogance turns him into the creature he hates the most in his life, a murderer. This story showed how words can be dangerous enough , even because of words someone can kill another. It is more important to pay attention to how someone would end their lives rather than how they started it. Poirot started his life, his career in good way but ended it in tragedic way.</span></p>
