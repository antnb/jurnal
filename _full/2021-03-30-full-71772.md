This study aims to determine the quality of biocatalysts produced using lignocellulolytic bacteria singly and to determine the best bacterial biocatalysts This research study was conducted at the Sesetan Laboratory and Animal Nutrition and Forage Laboratory of the Faculty of Animal Husbandry Udayana University which was conducted from June to September 2019 The design used was a completely randomized design CRD consisting of 6 treatments namely biocatalysts without lignocellulolytic bacteria as control B0  biocatalysts use Bacillus substilis BR4LG B1"
