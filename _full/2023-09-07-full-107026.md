According to Emodi (2011), meaning is the association between a word and the idea it refers to in the outside world (referential or denotative meaning). In another, it refers to the speaker's emotional condition as revealed by a variety of personal overtones (affective or connotative meaning). The language of advertising is a specific topic of study due to the originality of the word choices. This essay offers a semantically-level analytic investigation of the language characteristics of English ads.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disney</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The first signifier of the poster was the word “Disney” and has a denotative meaning. This word was found in all of “Encanto” movie posters. According to The Walt Disney Studios’ official site, The Walt Disney Studios has served as the cornerstone on which The Walt Disney Company has been established for the past 100 years. Nowadays, it offers consumers all over the world high-quality films, episodic storytelling, and stage plays. Disney, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Lucasfilm, Marvel Studios, Searchlight Pictures, and 20th Century Studios are all included in the group known as The Walt Disney Studios. Disney Theatrical Group, a company that creates top-notch theatrical productions, is also based there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The designer put “Disney” in the movie poster to make the viewer know the movie was made by a famous studio company in the world. This text can also make the audience interested to watch the movie because “Encanto” was produced by The Walt Disney Studios. The viewer may want</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">to watch this movie because they have watched the other movie produced by The Walt Disney Studios.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encanto</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The second signifier was the sentence “ENCANTO”. The sentence has connotative meanings. This sign is placed at the bottom of the poster. Specifically, under the word “Disney”. According to Compton (2022), Encanto, which means &quot;charm&quot; in English when translated from Spanish, makes for a suitable wordplay throughout the movie. A location full of wonders, enchantment, and the strength of a loving family, Casita is charming on the surface (as is the movie). Another significant method that the filmmakers of Encanto enhance the film's attractiveness is by including metaphorical references to butterflies. The architecture of Casita features several butterflies as a representation of the way Encanto's enchanted, enigmatic home serves as a type of cocoon for the Madrigals, shielding them from perils outside of their town. They live in a fascinating, lovely world inside their Casita bubble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Encanto, the newest computer-animated musical success from Disney, is set in a wonderful and enchanted village full of wonder and amazement, and its English title is aptly descriptive. The matriarch of the multi-generational Madrigal family, Abuela Alma Madrigal (Maria Cecilia</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Butero), is the guardian of a magical candle and the mother of three magically gifted triplets. Casita, the family's sentient home, serves as both a literal and metaphorical glue that keeps the unit together. Since the patriarch, Abuelo Pedro Madrigal, was lost when the family was forced to evacuate their home due to an armed conflict, Casita has safeguarded and housed the Madrigal family for generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The word “ENCANTO” is the biggest word on the poster and is written in blue and yellow. The designer of the poster chose the blue with yellow as the colour of the verbal sign to make it easier to read and this sign gives important information to the viewers. This verbal sign can signify the title of the movie. This sign is the main text or main focus of the poster. This sign has an important role to attract the audience to watch the film.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;November 2021</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The third verbal sign found in this poster is “NOVEMBER 2021”. the signified of the sentence has denotative meanings. This verbal sign appears in all of the posters and is located at the bottom of the poster. NOVEMBER 2021, that signified that Encanto movie was released in November 2021. This sign gives the most important information to the audience about the movie released. This signifier is really important to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">viewer to know when the Encanto movie will premiere in the cinema.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in theaters nov. 24</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The fourth verbal sign found in this poster is “ONLY IN THEATERS NOV. 24”. the signified of the sentence has denotative meanings. This verbal sign appears in all of the posters and is located at the bottom of the poster. ONLY IN THEATERS NOV. 24, that signified that Encanto movie was released on 24th of November. This sign gives the most important information to the audience about the date of the movie released. This signifier is really important to the viewer to know when the Encanto movie will premiere in the cinema.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magical House, Magical Family</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The sixth verbal sign found in this poster is “Magical House, Magical Family”. The sentence has connotative meanings. It means, there is a house in this movie named the Casa Madrigal, often known as Casita, is a setting from the Disney movie Encanto. The candle also gave them the house, which is where the Madrigal family resides in addition to the miraculous gifts. In a sense, the building is a character in and of itself because it is also sentient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The movie Encanto is about families. The miraculous presents shed light on the Madrigal family's relationships with its members. The house itself crumbles under the weight of the family's combined anguish as</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the movie demonstrates how intergenerational trauma is harbored.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>3.2.2.2 The Meaning of Visual Signs</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">This part consists of the analysis of the meaning of the visual signs found in five movie posters that were analysed by using the theory of visual signs proposed by Dyer (1982) and the theory of colours by Olesen (2013). Similar to the verbal sign, a visual sign also has their own meaning and messages, as follow:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poster 1</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In this poster, there was a door of a room in a house in the “Encanto” movie, The house named the Casa Madrigal (mainly referred to as Casita) is a location from Disney's feature film, Encanto. It is the residence of the Madrigal family, and along with the magical gifts, the house was given to them by the candle. The building is also sentient, practically making it a character in itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The door gave off light from within. In this house there was a flower plant that grew around the house. There were also animals looking at the door. It means that there is something behind the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The setting of the poster above is only the background. And the background here is in a room of the house. The background in this poster is dominated by black and yellow colour. Olesen (2013) states, black is a very powerful colour that represents a variety of things, including power,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">formality, sophistication, elegance, mystery, fear, evil, anonymity, wealth,uunhappiness, depth, style, sadness, remorse, and anger. It also represents the technical, underworld, and underground, as well as grief and death, as well as class, elegance, and wealth. Blackkis associated with death, bad luck, and evil spirits. Black isn't often chosen because it has such unfavorable associations. In fact, most individuals steer clear of this evil hue for fear that it may steal their joy. Black doesn't mean to frighten, but its gloomy aura doesn't exactly encourage optimism. Black is a colour that is utterly misunderstood. Although it inspires gloomy and melancholy ideas, it is harmless. Though it has accepted its unfavorable reputation, it still yearns to be accepted. Black is much more than just a gloomy hue; it's also strong, eye-catching, and protective. And Olesen (2013) states that “Yellow is the cheerful and upbeat colour. Yellow is a happy, upbeat colour thatmmakes everything more funbband joyful. It influences the logical portion of the brain, increasing cognition and perception, which facilitates learning. It arouses interest and stimulates cognition while enhancing zeal and self-assurance”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poster 2</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In this second poster, the attention of the audience will be focused on one of the main characters in the Encanto movie. The character in</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">this poster is a girl named Mirabel. She is the youngest daughter of Julieta and Agustín Madrigal and youngest sister of Isabela and Luisa, who has the distinction of being the only Madrigal by birth without a magical gift. However, when the miracle begins to fade, Mirabel takes it upon herself to save the magic, learning about hidden familial troubles along the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The character in this poster wore a white t-shirt. According to Colour Term by Olesen (2013), “White is the colour of innocence and purity. All colours are truly balanced in white. It is related to perfection, simplicity, and cleanliness. White is frequently thought of as being good, fresh, and pure”. Based on that, it can be assumed that white colour was chosen as the main character t-shirt to present a good and pure character. She also wore a blue skirt. According to Colour Term by Olesen (2013), “The colour blue symbolizes loyalty and trust. Blue, which encourages calmness and a sense of security and assurance, calms and relaxes our psyches”. Based on it, it can be assumed that the character is also loyal and confident. She also used green sunglasses. Based on the Colour Term by Olesen in 2013, “The colour green is generous and calming, reviving our body and mind. It brings our emotions into harmony and makes us feel secure”. it can be assumed that the characters present calm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The setting of the poster above is only the background. The background in this poster is dominated by green colour. &quot;Green is the colour of peace and health,&quot; claims Olesen (2013). The colour green is generous and calming, reviving our body and mind. It brings our emotions into harmony and makes us feel secure. Along with promising development and prosperity, it also inspires hope in us and bestows a little bit of good fortune to support us on our journey. Green can help treat sadness, tension, and anxiety as well as provide relief and physical and mental relaxation. Green evokes feelings of rebirth, liberation, restraint, and harmony.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poster 3</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In this poster, there was a character in the “Encanto” movie but in a door, named Bruno Madrigal or better known as Bruno. He is Pedro and Alma Madrigal's only son and youngest child, and he has the ability to predict the future. Bruno had become the &quot;black sheep&quot; of the Madrigals due to his peculiar behavior, affection for rats, and frequent prophecies of doom. As a result, the family had grown distant from him. After Bruno vanished, talking about him was frowned upon; the locals despised him as a villain until they discovered his steadfast love for his family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The character in this poster only draws on the door. It mantion</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">that the character were loose or gone. And the door was locked by a wood. It means that nobody can not come to the room. Bruno's expression looks very scary. Her eyes were full of fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The setting of the poster above is only the background. The background in this poster is dominated by brown colour. According to Olesen in 2013, the colour brown symbolizes dependability and stability. It is trustworthy and reassuring. A wise buddy and excellent advisor. Brown is a force to be reckoned with, radiating intelligence, firmness, and strength. Brown offers brilliant insight that is in high demand. Because it provides support and guidance, Brown truly is a guardian. Brown is a colour of many values and places a high value on family, duty, and morals.</span></p>
