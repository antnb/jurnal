Cysticercosis is a parasitic disease caused by tapeworm larvae called Cysticercus Cysticercus found in pigs is Cysticercus cellulosae which is the larvae of the tapeworm Taenia solium The purpose of this study was to determine the levels and fractions of Crude protein antigen C cellulosae C cellulosae used is local isolates obtained from infected pigs originating from Karangasem  Bali Determination of protein content larvae were performed using an Invitroge
