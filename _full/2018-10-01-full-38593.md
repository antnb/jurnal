<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">This research is focused to identify and analyze the role of the expert information as evidence in the case of corruption. One of the criminal acts of corruption that often occurs in the government is the criminal act of corruption in goods and services procurement, in which the perpetrators have abused the social aid fund from the government. There was the case of criminal act of corruption in goods and services procurement for social aid fund that occurred in Tabanan -Bali, which committed by I Wayan Sukaja, who had corrupted the State’s financial or social aid fund. Within the process of verification in the trial, the public prosecutors submit 2 (two) experts who provided information to assist in terms of verification. This study uses normative research methods. The purpose of this study is to analyze the role of expert information as evidence in criminal act of corruption. The role of an expert cannot be ignored because it will help the judges, prosecutors and lawyers who have limited knowledge. If the expert’s information is contrary, it could be ruled out by the judges but the expert’s information that excluded must be based on clear reason, and the judges must have strong base in assess the role of the expert’s information.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1. Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Corruption is an example of the white collar crimes. Unlike any other conventional crimes which would involve violence </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(street crime, blue collar crime, blue jeans crime),</span><span class="font3"> the perpetrators of this white collar crime usually are those elites with high social status and highly educated. Its modus operandi is more likely to be done in a sophisticated way, and sometimes even include scientific theories of certain knowledge such as accounting and statistics<sup>1</sup>.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Criminal act of corruption is one of some special crimes which regulated outside The Criminal Code<sup>2</sup>. Corruption in a comprehensive context is a white collar crime which its modus operandi continues to grow in every aspect. White collar crime is also said to be “an invisible crime”, and often requires a system approach to eradicate it since it is quite hard to acquire its procedural verification. Generally, white collar crimes are not easily traceable<sup>3</sup>. Corruption is not only about criminalization, but also how the policy of criminal law facing the invisible crime<sup>4</sup>. Law No. 31 of 1999 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">juncto</span><span class="font3"> Law No. 20 of 2001 about Eradication of The Criminal Act of Corruption is actually emphasizing on both criminalization for the perpetrators of corruption and State’s financial loss due to the corruption. In the perspective of Law No. 31 of 1999 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">juncto</span><span class="font3"> Law No. 20 of 2001, State’s loss is something which is caused by an act against the law or abuse of power, authority, and opportunity related to his post or position<sup>5</sup>. Law of Eradication of The Criminal Act of Corruption was born in the atmosphere of Indonesian people who demand clean and good governance and also has a public accountability<sup>6</sup>. The cause of corruption is the lack of moral integrity which is also weakens the national discipline. In addition, the weak systems and mechanisms in various sectors of bureaucracy and law enforcement are also become one of the causes<sup>7</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some forms of corruption that often occur in Indonesia including embezzlement, budget mark ups, budget misuse, and misuse of social aid fund for the poor. Criminal Act of Corruption in Goods and Services Procurement is one of the frequent types among it, which has abused social aid funds from State and or Regional’s budgets. One of the cases that happened in Bali was the case from Tabanan which committed by I Wayan Sukaja as The Head of Regional House of Representatives for 2004-2009. There were irregularities carried out in this case which resulted in corruption of State’s financial budget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Verification holds an essential role in the investigation process at the trial. Through the verification the fate of defendant is determined. Verification as an activity is an attempt to prove something (an object that is proven), through evidence that may be used in certain ways to state whether what has been shown is proven by law or not. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">principle of minimum verification is a principle that regulates the limits that should be fulfilled to prove the defendant’s fault. In article 184, paragraph 1 of Criminal Code Procedures states that one of the legal evidence types which may be used to prove evidence is an expert’s information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The presence of an expert in providing information on an investigation into the occurrence of Criminal Law (in this case, the criminal act of corruption) becomes very important in all stages of investigation, both in the stage of investigation, action, even report delivery to public prosecutor<sup>8</sup>. The role of experts is needed because it will help the judges, prosecutors and lawyers who have limited knowledge</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font3"> The expert information is also necessary to convince the judge if the presented evidence is less optimal. In the case of Criminal Act of Corruption which committed by I Wayan Sukaja, in the matter of verification at the trial the public prosecutor presented 2 (two) experts to provide information in order to assist in the verification process<sup>9</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the description of the background mentioned above, it is clear that there is a large influence of evidence in terms of verification of proving the Criminal Act of Corruption in Goods and Services Procurement in the trial, especially at Denpasar Criminal Act of Corruption Court. Based on this background, the author is interested to conduct a research with the title “Expert Information as An Evidence of Criminal Act of Corruption in Goods and Services Procurement”. The focuses of the study to be discussed are as follows: First, why is the expert information necessary in the verification process of proving case of Criminal Act of Corruption? Second, what is the role of expert information as evidence in terms of proving case of Criminal Act of Corruption in Goods and Services Procurement, regarding the decision of the Corruption Court No: 01 / PID.SUS / 2013 / P.TIPIKOR DPS ?</span></p>

The specific objective of this study is to describe and analyze why expert information is needed in the process of proving the case of Criminal Act of Corruption, and to describe and analyze the role of expert information as evidence in the case of Criminal Act of Corruption in Goods and Services Procurement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The research method used in this study is normative legal research, in which according to Soerjono Soekanto, normative legal research is a legal research conducted by examining library materials which means that this study is done by examining norms, principles, philosophy and or doctrine and legal principles in materials literature<sup>13</sup>.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expert Information is Required in the Verification Process of Criminal</span><br><br><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Act of Corruption</span></h2></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Verification as an activity is an attempt to prove something (an object that is proven), through evidence that may be used in certain ways to state whether what has been shown could be proven according to law or not. The process of proving the activities carried out jointly by three parties, namely prosecutors, judges and defendants accompanied by lawyers, which all aspects have been determined and regulated by law.<sup>15</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Expert information is information given by someone who has special expertise about the things needed to make the light of a case for the purposes of the examination (Article 1 number 28 of the Criminal Procedure Code). What content must be explained by the expert, and what conditions must be fulfilled so that the expert's information has a value not stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Code, but it can be thought that based on Article 1 number 28 of the Criminal Procedure Code, specifically there are 2 (two) requirements of the expert information:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is explained must be about everything that falls within the scope of his expertise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is explained about his expertise was closely related to the case being examined.<sup>16</sup></span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The period of HIR (Herziene Indonesian Reglement) expert information is not categorized as evidence of criminal proceedings. HIR does not view expert information as a valid proof, but considers it as a statement that can be used as a judge to be his own opinion, if the judge considers that the expert’s information can be accepted. Article 184 paragraph (1) of the Criminal Code Procedure has stated expert information</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">as a legal evidence and is located in the second place after evidence of witness testimony. The value of verification strength of an expert is as the same as of the evidence of witness information. Therefore the value of verification that is attached to the evidence of expert information, namely having the value of a free verification force (vrij bewijskracht) means that there is no requirement for the judge to accept the truth of the expert information, but the judge must be truly responsible and in accordance with the minimum evidentiary principle regulated in Article 183 of the Criminal Code Procedure, an independent expert’s information without being supported by one of other evidences, is not sufficient to prove the defendant's guilt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The evidence used in proving Criminal Act of Corruption is the same with the one used in other general crimes as stated in Article 184 of the Criminal Code Procedure. To prove the occurrence of corruption, the role and position of evidence that is formed through the means of proof of information and documentary evidence must be added with at least one legal evidence, for example, supplemented with evidence of expert’s information. The need of an expert in a trial of criminal case is a logic consequence of law development in the society. Bismar Siregar assesses that improving people's lives also means increasing legal needs.<sup>17</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The existence of expert information in Criminal Code Procedure means that the role of an expert in a case investigation, both in scrutiny and trial level cannot be ignored. Expert information is very useful in the process of proving cases of corruption. Expert information is needed because both public prosecutors, lawyers, and judges have limited knowledge. Expert information is also useful to convince judges and defendants and lawyers that accompanies them when the evidence served is less optimal. Djoko Prakoso emphasizes that the Criminal Code Procedure has determined the expert's information as a legal evidence, that can’t be ignored by the judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The judge cannot ignore the expert's information but if the process of proving a criminal act requires a lot of expertise of experts who master science and technology, then the judge must adjust his assessment of the existence of expert information with the criminal case he handled, and has an argument in accepting or rejecting it. Experts are needed to maintain objectivity in the trial. The expert will be on the truth side according to his skill. The expert is considered as a neutral party so that he can provide clear opinions and not influenced by charge assumption filed by the public prosecutor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">3.2 . The Role of Expert Information as An Evidence in Verification of Criminal Act of Corruption in Goods and Services Procurement in the Court Ruling of Criminal Act of Corruption No: 01 / PID.SUS / 2013 / P.TIPIKOR DPS.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The case of Criminal Act of Corruption sometimes require expert information to make a case clear, so the public prosecutor, judge, and lawyers will present an expert to provide information in a trial. His information is not any information, but the experts must have skills related to the case in the trial. In the Court Ruling number: 01 / PID.SUS / 2013 / P.TIPIKOR DPS, there are 3 (three) cases of corruption which present expert information in the trial, namely:</span></p>

This is what is meant by responsibility concept of State financial. In addition, the expert also explained that State financial assistance (public scope), not private money because it is obtained from the regional budget in which the allocation is clear according to the shopping budget plan (RAB) proposal, not obtained in a transactional manner that is private.
