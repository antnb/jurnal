<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract </span><span class="font3">This study discusses the behavior of the characters in anime Aura: Maryuinkoga Saigo no Tatakai who are suffering from chunibyo psychological disorders. Chunibyo behavior can occur because of excessive admiration of animated character so that one can be dissolved in an imaginary world. Through the psychological theory of literature and psychology of personality this paper analyzes the behavior of chunibyo in Anime Aura: Maryuinkoga Saigo no Tatakai, discrimination exercised by the local community and how to cure chunibyo psychological disorders. The results showed that the characters in anime Aura: Maryuinkoga Saigo no Tatakai suffer from psychological disorder of chunibyo jakigankei type characterized, among others, by possession of another identity, consider themselves super hero, come from other world, and the rejection of the environment. Discriminatory behavior which is the most widely accepted by the patient of chunibyo is ijime (bullying). In this anime, the characters can be cured in many ways by involving them into the fantasy world and taking them back to the real world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction<sup>4</sup></span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Japan is a country that has the largest animation industry. There is a special term to describe the work of animation made in Japan, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">anime</span><span class="font3">. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Anime</span><span class="font3"> began to develop in Japan around the 1970s dues to the advance of Japanese comic industry. In 1980 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">anime </span><span class="font3">was a global phenomenon with the development of the Internet in the 1990s. The Anime worldwide well known inckudes Dragon Ball, Naruto, One Piece, and so forth (Garcia, 2010: 100).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Along with the booming of anime, Japanese youth increasingly love Japanese animation. They not only collect DVD of anime, anime figure, even to mimic the style of anime characters that they admire. Excessive love makes young Japanese feel that they are actually characters from the anime they watch, even worse they have their own world, a different world with the teens of their age. Such a personality can be formed because the identification process is the tendency of a person to be the same with others or emulate that person. If the impersonation of an anime</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">character is one of pop culture in Japan, of course, it can be categorized as a psychological disorder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Such psychological symptoms in Japanese is known as chunibyo. The word chunibyo consists of three </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font3"> letters, namely </span><span class="font1">中 </span><span class="font3">(CHU) 'middle / junior highschool'; Ξ2 (ni) 'two'; and </span><span class="font1">^</span><span class="font3">(</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">byo</span><span class="font3">) 'sick' Literally chunibyo can be translated into the eighthgrade disease. Chunibyo refers to psychological symptoms commonly suffered by children in junior high school who consider themselves as if tohave a supernatural power and assume the surrounding world is a world of its own with a variety of hidden strength (Hyoya, 2009: 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The stories about characters who have psychological disorders have been widely raised in comics, movies, and anime. One anime that picked up the story of the characters who have psychological disorders chunibyo is Aura: Maryuinkoga Saigo no Tatakai (Aura: The last fight of the Chosen, Fang of Light). The anime is an adaptation of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">manga</span><span class="font3"> of the same title written by Kouichirou Hoshino published in April 2012. The main character is Sato Ichiro who had suffered from the syndrome of chunibyo while in junior high school. He came out of his old school and bury deep the syndrome he ever suffered. He</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">eventually recovered, but he found a friend with the same boat that Sato Ryoko. Ichiro was moved to bring Ryoko back to the real world. Sato Ryoko dressed in Anime figure that she had idolized even when attending class, his clothes was known as cosplay (costume player). Various attempts were made by Sato Ichiro to resuscitate his classmates in order not dissolved in the imaginary world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Saigo no Tatakai</span><span class="font3"> or 'final battle' referred to in the title of this anime is Sato Ichiro's return once again to the imaginary world that had once been painstakingly he left behind to take Sato Ryoko back to the real world at the same time recover from chunibyo syndrome suffered.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">II.</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The type of research data is qualitative, in narrative form, expression, and signs contained in images or the anime text which becomes the object of research. This study uses two sources of data, namely primary and secondary data sources. The primary data source is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">anime</span><span class="font3"> DVD entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Aura</span><span class="font3">: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Maryuinkoga Saigo no Tatakai</span><span class="font3">. This </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">anime</span><span class="font3"> is based on the novel of the same title, written by Tanaka Romeo. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Anime</span><span class="font3"> that lasted 83 minutes was released the first time on April 13, 2013, directed by Seiji Kishi and produced by studio AIC ASTA. Secondary data sources are books on Japanese social problems and personality psychology books. In addition, it also used books, magazines, and records of the informants associated with this research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The method used in the data collection is a documentation method with note taking techniques. The method used in the data analysis is descriptive analysis method, a method that is done by describing the facts, then followed by analysis. The data were translated (transliterated) from Japanese into Indonesian. In this study, all data are presented in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font3"> and its translations. On the next step analysis and interpretation are done to understand the psychological state of the characters suffering chunibyo in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">anime</span><span class="font3"> A</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">u</span><span class="font3">ra: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Maryuinkoga Saigo no Tatakai.</span><span class="font3"> The theory used is the theory of literary psychology as a large umbrella theory and supported by psychological theory of personality</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">III.</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results and Discussion</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Each individual has integrity properties or different, diverse and unique, self-characteristics as well as the adolescents with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chunibyo</span><span class="font3"> psychological disorders. In the book Chunibyo Toriatsukai Setsumeisho </span><span class="font1">ψ2⅛ ¾⅛S½KW </span><span class="font3">' Explanatory book of Chunibyo' There are three kinds of people suffering from chunibyo 'ie </span><span class="font1">邪気眼系 </span><span class="font3">(</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">jakigankei</span><span class="font3">), DQN </span><span class="font1">系 </span><span class="font3">(DQNkei), and </span><span class="font1">サブ</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">カル系 </span><span class="font3">(</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sabukarukei</span><span class="font3">). From The three categories, it is known that the chunibyo syndrome suffered by figures in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Aura: Maryuinkoga Saigo no Tatakai</span><span class="font3"> belongs to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">jakigankei</span><span class="font3"> type. Patients with this type tend to feel that they have supernatural powers. Patients also often fantasized into a super hero who must save the world from danger. The character with the chunibyo behavior </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">depicted in anime Aura Maryuinkouga Saigo no Tatakai</span><span class="font3"> is Sato Ryoko as the central figure in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">anime</span><span class="font3">. Sato Ichiro had once suffered from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chunibyo </span><span class="font3">syndrome yet been recovered, and several Sato Ichiro classmates namely Kinoshita, Osamu Suzuki, Hino, Tatsuo Andou and Oda.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Saigono Tatakai</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Patients with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">jakigankei</span><span class="font3"> type of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chunibyo </span><span class="font3">psychological disorders can be said to experience a crisis of identity in adolescence. The search for identity ego is said to peak during adolescence as young people who are struggling to figure out who he really is with the development of puberty, teenagers look for a new role to help them discover their sexual identity, ideological, or work. The behavior of character with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chunibyo</span><span class="font3"> syndromes in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">anime</span><span class="font3">, who has another identity, consider herself super hero, coming from another world, and the rejection of the environment. Here are some data about the behavior of leaders who suffer from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chunibyo</span><span class="font3"> psychological disorders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the main characteristics of jakigankei type of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chunibyo</span><span class="font3"> syndrome is a double personality so that they have an identity other than their original names. According to the psychological theory of personality proposed by Erikson the identity crisis and identity confusion reached its peak at the stage of adolescence. This is certainly evident in the attitude of someone who suffers from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chunibyo</span><span class="font3"> syndrome. They seemed to have forgotten the identity even their names and replace them with the names of their idol figures</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Picture 1: Sato Ryoko</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The characters in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">anime</span><span class="font3"> mostly suffer from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chunibyo</span><span class="font3"> psychological disorders and they have other identities. A person's identity can be described, either in positive or negative way. Most teens decide what they want and what they believe, while also discover what they do not want it to be and what they do not believe. Often, they have to deny the values of their parents and reject the values of fellow group, a dilemma that can strengthen their identity confusion (Feist, 2010: 305).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Teens who suffer from chunibyo psychological disorders in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">anime</span><span class="font3"> decided to become a figure they want, as in the data (1) and Picture 1 Sato Ryoko called herself a &quot;researcher&quot;, while Sato Ichiro data (2) who had been cured of the psychological disorder he suffered from never considered himself as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">maryuinkouga</span><span class="font3"> 'the chosen one, a dark hero'. While Sato Ichiro’s five classmates consider themselves to belong to a group of ' Dream Soldiers '. The characters suffered from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chunibyo</span><span class="font3"> usually called themselves in accordance with their respective idols. In Sato Ichiro’s class seen </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chunibyo</span><span class="font3"> syndrome patients seem to have a diverse idol, none is the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Against things that displease, an individual will show rejection, so is the case in patients with chunibyo syndrome. There are two kinds of individual rejection including aggression and withdrawal. If the individual has the power to deal with the threatening environment he will perform a resistance or opposition to the environment. However, the main character with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chunibyo</span><span class="font3"> syndrome, Sato Ryoko, feels weak or does not have the strength to resist the environment then he will avoid or escape. Sato Ryoko who is a new student of a senior high school apparently never attended classes, she did withdrawl as a form of resistance to the environment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Kawaii : No, Satou who is sitting on your left row.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sato Ichiro : Oh ... She has not come to school yet, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Kawaii : Probably she never will. It's been over a week since the school started</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sato Ryoko’s classmates apparently wondered what Sato Ryoko was like. Sato Ichiro who has the similar surname (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">myoji</span><span class="font3">) do not even know the name of his classmates who had been absent for a week since the ceremony for welcoming new students. The rejection of this kind according to Adler has a tendency to escape from trouble, keeping a social distance. There are four types of tendency to withdraw including moving backward, standing-still, hesitating, and constructing barrier. Sato Ryoko who did not attend classes because of the chunibyo syndrome can be said to be moving backward or return to earlier stages of development. As a girl who is entering High School to behave like a super hero and dressing cosplay is a setback.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A rejection to the environment can vary, such as silent deed with no reaction, not present at an activity, including the refusal to go to school conducted by</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sato Ryoko and the worst in this anime is the desire of Sato Ryoko to go out of this world and go into the world of imagination by falling from height. It shows an act of suicide.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">On the data (5) Sato Ichiro suspects that Sato Ryoko intends to freefall from the school’s top. Sato Ryoko in his fantasy assumes that ritual to save the world, one must be sacrificed by free fall. If someone frequently and exaggeratedly goes into a fantasy world because he is not strong enough to face realities of life, the person will be easily discouraged, disillusioned by the time he returned to the real world. With the fantasy people are easy to lie because he is mastered by fantasy, especially in children (Sujanto, 2014: 53).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Syndrome Sufferers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Japanese society does not readily accept differences in a group, it is also reflected in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">anime</span><span class="font3">. The characters experiencing chunibyo syndrome are perceived differently by their friends. Differences in dress and behaviour make chunibyo syndrome get discriminated primarily from the school friends and society. For teenagers who have never experienced this syndrome will certainly consider that chunibyo patients who use strange clothes and behave strangely are the people who must be removed from their association. People with this syndrome generally receive ijime treatment or bullying from classmates.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Sato Ichiro who had experienced the same psychological disorders felt empathy and sympathy on Sato Ryoko suffering. Sympathy is a tendency to feel for what is being felt by others (feeling with another person). Empathy is a condition when a person's feelings are in a situation of others (feeling into another person) (Sukmadinata, 2011: 81). Sato Ichiro who had realized that the three years of the junior high school was the period in which he searched for identity and made it through a crisis of identity who intended to help his friends to get back on their identity, namely high school youth and not a super hero in their imaginative. Basically, identity confusion is a symptom of the problem which covers the separate self-image, the denial of family or community standards. However, the identity confusion is normal and necessary. Younger children should experience a bit of doubt and confusion about themselves before they can develop a solid identity. On the data (8) Sato Ichiro wanted to help Sato Ryoko to return to the real world from the fantasy world, and Sato Ryoko began to feel that her existence was accepted by Sato Ichiro.</span></p>

Erikson called it a turning point that is the crucial period that will increase the fragility and potential mounting. In every crisis, a person is vulnerable to modifications especially in identity, both positive and negative.

Yet his friends, especially Sato Ryoko after she had passed the junior high school so it was worrying and must be cured. Various groups helped, including families, teachers, and especially friends. Sato Ryoko’s recovery process who suffered from severe chunibyo psychological disorder was not easy. Homeroom also played a role by arranging seating and approached Sato Ryoko as if the homeroom understood the imaginary world. Finally, Sato Ryoko recovered by virtue of the hard struggle of her friend, Sato Ichiro who had experienced the same thing. Sato Ichiro advised, rebuked, and the last way was to go into the world of Sato Ryoko. He allowed himself to go back again to the dark period in order to help Sato Ryoko. Finally, Sato Ryoko was able to recover and proved by her return to school wearing uniform and left her cosplay clothes. She also asked Sato Ichiro to teach how to be an ordinary man.</span></p>
