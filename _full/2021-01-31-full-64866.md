Dual graph is one form of graph that can only be formed from graphs whose edges do not intersect each other One of the graphs that can be converted into dual graphs is the antiprism graph Amn  Antiprism graph Amn is a graph that is formed from the absorption of vertices in the prism graph Pmn  One of the operations performed on a graph is finding the metric dimension of the graph These metric dimensions are looking to find a minimum cardinality value of the gra
