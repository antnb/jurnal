<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hal-hal yang dibahas pada studi ini adalah penjelasan kondisi tutur dan komponen tindak tutur terhadap jenis representatif ilokusi yang ditemukan dalam film “Bruce Almighty” dan “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”. Jenis representatif ilokusi yang ditemukan diklasifikasi dan dianalisa berdasarkan teori yang dikemukakan oleh Searle (1976). Teori lain yang digunakan untuk memperkuat analisa adalah dan komponen tindak tutur oleh Austin (1962).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hasil yang ditunjukkan pada studi ini adalah terdapat enam jenis representatif ilokusi yang ditemukan pada kedua film. Keenam jenis tersebut adalah “swearing”, “threatening”, “complaining”, “insisting”, “claiming”, dan “hypothesizing”. Kemudian, dilanjutkan dengan penjelasan kondisi tutur dan komponen tindak tutur dari enam jenis tindakan representatif ilokusi yang ditemukan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kata kunci : representatif ilokusi, kondisi tutur, komponen tindak tutur</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of the Study</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Various groups have a different way or manner in using speech. Therefore, a consideration is required regarding to how the speaker organizes what they intend to say. This perspective then raises question of what determines between the said and the unsaid. Then, Pragmatics which closely linked to speech acts emerged to resolve the problem within the phenomenon. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bruce Almighty</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</span><span class="font2"> was the data source which contain unique utterances referred to the necessity in representative illocutionary act study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The formulated problems in this study are as follows;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What types of representative illocutionary acts are found in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bruce Almighty </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Captain America: The Winter Soldier m</span><span class="font2">ovie?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the speech conditions and component of speech acts of illocutions</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">found in the movies?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aims</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The specific aims correspond the formulated problem as follows;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To identify and classify types of representative illocutionary acts found in the movies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bruce Almighty</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Captain America: The Winter Soldier.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explain the speech condition and component of speech acts of the illocutions found in the movies.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In this study, the data were obtained from various utterances in the dialogue of both movie scripts. The documentation method was applied to collect the data and the data analyzed using descriptive qualitative method since the data described based on certain theories and the data were considered as qualitative or in form of word or utterances which referred to certain definition or meaning.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Result and Discussion</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Six types of representative illocutionary act proposed by Searle (1976) were found in both movies. However, there was no finding of swearing in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Captain America: The Winter Soldier.</span><span class="font2"> The findings are presented as follows;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swearing</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Searle (1976:10) stated that representative illocutionary can be assessed by the true or false category. In the following example, the character named Phil in that particular situation affirmed that he never saw the marijuana in his van was the case and it was true which indicates the swearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">BRUCE: (…) I’d call that a red-letter day for any K-9 unit, but was that enough for old Hank here? No, sirree. Moments later, he busted a local news camera crew with 220 pounds of marijuana. (Police officers arrested Phil and crew. At the particular time, Phil’s van was full of marijuana)</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark3"></a>PHIL: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I never saw it before, I swear!</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">The utterance </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“I never saw it before, I swear!”</span><span class="font2"> can be classified into swearing by looking at the syntactical choices. The word </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“swear” </span><span class="font2">was used by the speaker in delivering the utterance. By looking at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">preparatory condition</span><span class="font2">,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">there was a truth that previously in Phil’s van, there was no marijuana that made him as the speaker say the swearing utterance. Then, by looking the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">sincerity condition</span><span class="font2">, the speaker felt highly convinced toward the utterance. And last, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">essential condition </span><span class="font2">made Phil affirmed that the police should not arrest him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on Austin’s (1962:94) component of speech acts, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">locution </span><span class="font2">or the linguistic properties of the utterance was the utterance is imperative form. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">illocution </span><span class="font2">or the speaker’s intention of the utterance was in this context of situation; Phil intended to prove something true that he did not bring the marijuana. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">perlocution </span><span class="font2">or the effect on the hearer was the police noticed that Phil committed a crime and began to arrest Phil (speaker) because of the marijuana in his car.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threatening</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The following is the example of threatening in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bruce Almighty</span><span class="font2">;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Then, Bruce noticed a poor homeless man that he saw previously was disturbed by the gangster. They saw the homeless man held a board which contained writing “ARE YOU BLIND”. The Gangster seemed annoyed with that and started to disturb him.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">GANGSTER: Do I look blind to you? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Do I look blind to you? </span><span class="font2">(Chattering on a homeless man)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">BRUCE: Hey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following is the example of threatening in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Captain America: The winter Soldier;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">PIERCE: Captain, somebody murdered my friend and I’m gonna find out why. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Anyone gets in my way, they’re gonna regret it. Anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROGERS: Understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The utterance </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Do I look blind to you?”</span><span class="font2">, can be classified into threatening. By looking the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">preparatory condition</span><span class="font2">, it can be seen that in the utterance there was the truth that the homeless man showed his writing to people around him and made one member of the gangster said the threatening utterance. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">sincerity condition </span><span class="font2">was the speaker felt highly convinced with the utterance. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">essential condition </span><span class="font2">was; the utterance made by the speaker committed him to state his intention to take very unfriendly or aggressive action and ready to argue or fight</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">against the homeless man in severe punishments for his writing. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">locution </span><span class="font2">of the utterance was the utterance was interrogative in form. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">illocutionary </span><span class="font2">of the utterance was the gangster intended to harm the homeless man. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">perlocution </span><span class="font2">of the utterance was the homeless man avoided the accident that would happened to him by not showing an offensive attempt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Moreover, the utterance </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Anyone gets in my way, they’re gonna regret it. Anyone.”</span><span class="font2"> Was a threatening with </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">preparatory condition </span><span class="font2">of the utterance can be assessed by looking at the truth that Fury was died that made Pierce said the utterance. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">sincerity condition </span><span class="font2">was that Pierce felt highly convinced with his utterance and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">essential condition </span><span class="font2">made him state his intention to take very unfriendly or aggressive action and ready to argue or fight against Rogers. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">locution </span><span class="font2">was the utterance was declarative in form and it was defamatory. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">illocution </span><span class="font2">was Pierce as the speaker intended to harm anyone that got in his way. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">perlocution </span><span class="font2">was Rogers accepted his threat.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaining</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The following is an example of complaining in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bruce Almighty</span><span class="font2">:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">GRACE: Thank God you’re all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">BRUCE: God. Yeah. Let’s thank God. Shall we? For his blessings are raining down upon me. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Wait! That’s not rain!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following is an example of complaining in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Captain America</span><span class="font2">;</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">FURY: It’s called compartmentalization. Nobody spills the secrets, because nobody knows them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The utterance </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wait! That’s not rain!”</span><span class="font2"> emerged with the accident that happened to Bruce that made him said the complaining utterance as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">preparatory condition</span><span class="font2">. His believed in the truth of the proposition was the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">sincerity condition</span><span class="font2">. The utterance said by Bruce committed him expressed or showed his dissatisfaction toward Grace. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">locution </span><span class="font2">was the utterance which was imperative. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">illocution </span><span class="font2">was; Bruce intended to disagree with Grace’s utterance. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">perlocution was </span><span class="font2">Grace who tried to calm him down but everything was turned into a big fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Moreover, the utterance </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I can’t lead a mission when the people I’m leading have missions of their own.”</span><span class="font2"> came with the truth that Romanoff operated another mission that made Rogers say the complaining utterance.

The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">illocution </span><span class="font2">was Rogers felt not satisfied towards Fury. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">perlocution </span><span class="font2">was Fury convinced Rogers that everything was fine during the mission.</span></p>

Meanwhile, threatening was the most frequent type occurred in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</span><span class="font2"> due to the number of antagonist characters that have a tendency to deliver the threatening utterance. Lastly, “swearing”, “threatening”, “complaining”, “insisting”, “claiming” and “hypothesizing” are the types or the illocutionary verbs that used to mark the function of the representative illocutionary acts.</span></p>
