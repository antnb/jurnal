<p><span class="font1">Tourism is one of the leading business sectors that continues to develop in academic studies. This study aims to reveal a model of tourism activity development in supporting community business improvement in the Biroro Bontolerung River Area, Gowa Regency. The method applied is descriptive-qualitative with unit analysis of product resources and social resources at the research site. This research has identified the concept of tourism activities that are suitable to be developed in the Biroro Bontolerung River Area based on the concept of experiential tourism. Furthermore, this research has resulted in mapping the interests and interests of relevant stakeholders, to be studied further in making development decisions for the government and the community.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The COVID-19 pandemic that has occurred since 2019 has had a negative impact on global tourism growth (Loannides &amp;&nbsp;Gyimóthy, 2020), which was marked by a 65% decline in international tourist arrivals or the equivalent of 440 million visits in the first semester of 2020 (UNWTO, 2020). The Asia-Pacific region recorded the largest negative growth in international tourist arrivals of -96% above the global average of -87% (UNWTO, 2021). International, regional, and local travel restrictions have affected the tourism system, namely international travel, domestic tourism, day visits and the air transport industry, cruise ships, public transport, accommodation, restaurants, conventions,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">festivals, or sporting events (Gössling, Scott, &amp;&nbsp;Hall, 2021). On the other hand, the pandemic has had a positive impact on reducing over-tourism and providing opportunities for sub-urban areas to develop the concept of environmentally-based sustainable tourism (Koh, 2020) and smart tourism (Susanto et al., 2020). This indicator shows the impact of the pandemic on changes in market preferences, perceptions, and behavior for travel (Peters et al., 2020). Responding to this change, tourism policy makers need to follow up with product development that is in line with these changes (Brouder et al., 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The South Sulawesi Government in the 2015-2030 Tourism Development Master Plan (RIPPARDA) has established 7 Provincial Tourism Destinations (DPP) consisting of Provincial Tourism Strategic</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Areas (KSPP) and Provincial Tourism Areas (South Sulawesi Provincial Government, 2015). The DPP area consists of three Regional Tourism Destinations (DPD). First, the Southern Regional DPD, namely Makassar, Gowa and its surroundings, Bulukumba and its surroundings, the Selayar Islands and its surroundings. Second, the Central Region DPD, covering Wajo and its surroundings, Pare-Pare and its surroundings. Third, the DPD for the North region, covering Palopo and its surroundings. Toraja and its surroundings. Gowa Regency is one of the KSPPs with the theme of nature tourism with the iconic Malino City which is relevant to the issue of changing tourist behavior during the pandemic. Tourism development in this area has the theme of mountain nature tourism and its inherent features including rivers, valleys, hills, and villages along with environmental conservation efforts, especially Mount Bawakaraeng.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In another policy document (Bappeda, South Sulawesi, 2017), Gowa Regency is designated as a Leading Tourist Area. This relates to the area's resources that are suitable for mountain, jungle, and river-based adventure activities. The determination of this area has an impact on the strategy of developing activities on a site scale that does not require massive physical development, but still meets the rules of tourism service standards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The development is intended to support quality-tourism experiences (Beardsley et al., 2018) and experiential tourism (Kozak &amp;&nbsp;Kozak, 2018). Malino City, Tinggimoncong District, Gowa Regency is one of the areas designated as a tourism development area. The city of Malino is located in the mountains with a landscape of mountains, hills, valleys with several rivers and waterfalls as the main attraction. Land cover in the form of forests and tea plantations (although no longer producing) completes the attractiveness of this area, reinforcing the theme of developing river-</span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font2"></span><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">based special interest tourism. One of the existing tourist attractions, namely the &quot;Takapala&quot; waterfall and the &quot;Ketemu mate&quot; waterfall, is located in Bontolerung Village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In fact, this area has been visited by local tourists regularly. However, the development of tourism activities in this area has not been carried out optimally. The varied potential of the area has not been able to be used to provide a visiting experience for tourists. This is related to the absence of directions for the development of river-based tourism activities and tourism management which still relies on government initiatives. In fact, several studies have shown that the development of river tourism can have a positive impact on the regional economy (Ajake &amp;&nbsp;Amalu, 2012; Budisetyorini et al., 2021; Putro et al., 2021), environmental conservation (Mafruhah et al., 2020), and social change (Sheldon &amp;&nbsp;Fesenmaier, 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The alternative for developing Bontolerung river tourism uses a combination of community-based tourism approaches (Khalid et al., 2019) and experiential tourism (Meacci &amp;&nbsp;Liberatore, 2018; Smith, 2006) in order to obtain a formulation of a strategy for developing experience-based river tourism activities that utilizes the potential of the community as actors. major tourism. Research on tourism development in the river area through the principles of experiential learning and community-based tourism still has the opportunity to be expanded. It is known that the concept of developing tourism areas has focused on the physical development of the area, or at least departed from the idea that mass-tourists are the best choice for tourism areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This study tries to provide a different perspective on how a river area is packaged into a product that provides experiences and reveals the interests and interests of the stakeholders in it. Considering these conditions, applied research was</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">conducted to explore data and information regarding river tourism product resources and social resources in Bontolerung Village, Tinggimoncing District, Gowa Regency. With this, it can be formulated a model for the development of river-based tourism activities on the Bontolerung River, Bontolerung Village, Tinggimon-cong District, Gowa Regency.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">This study uses a descriptive-qualitative method to describe the potential of resources owned in a tourism object and its development model. The research location is the Bontolerung river area in Bontolerung Village, Tinggimoncing District, Gowa Regency. The research was conducted in July-August 2022. The method of data collection was through field observations and literature studies. Analysis of river tourism development uses a community-based tourism approach (Khalid et al., 2019) and experiential tourism (Meacci &amp;&nbsp;Liberatore, 2018; Smith, 2006). An antithesis approach to the previous approach which exploited the physical development of the area or mass-tourist as a measure of tourism performance. On the other hand, these two approaches will provide a different perspective, namely how an area is packaged into a product that provides experience and reveals the interests and interests of the stakeholders in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>General Description</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Gowa Regency is one of 24 Regen-cies/Cities in South Sulawesi. This regency is 10 km from the center of Makassar City, its territory is flanked by a number of re-gencies/cities. The northern part is with Makassar and Maros, the southern part is with Takalar and Jeneponto, the western part is with Makassar and Takalar, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">eastern part is Sinjai, Bulukumba and Ban-taeng. It has an area of 1,888.33 km2 (3.01% of South Sulawesi's area), divided into 18 sub-districts with 167 villages/ke-lurahan. The characteristics of the area can be divided into two, namely lowlands and highlands, each with 9 sub-districts. The city of Sungguminasa, the capital of the district, includes three sub-districts: Somba Opu in its entirety, Partially Pallangga and Partly Bontomarannu. There are three largest sub-districts which are all located in the highlands, respectively: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biringbulu</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(11.26%), Kuncio Pao (251%) and Parang Loe (11.75%) of the area of Gowa Regency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In terms of population, Gowa Regency is the third area after Makassar City and Bone Regency which has the largest population of 659,513 (2011). The main occupation of the community is still dominated by the agricultural sector (46.98%), followed by trade (17.74%), services (11.90%), and industry (10.74%). With this pattern and structure of work, the Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) per capita in 2020, based on constant 2010 prices, is 27.45 million with an average economic growth rate of 6.5 percent. This is quite interesting. Because even though it is in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the growth trend remains positive at 1.76 percent, while South Sulawesi experienced a contraction of 0.70 percent. In addition, this area was previously the epicenter of the transmission, in addition to Makassar City and Maros Regency. However, this achievement does not mean that it has been able to overcome a number of problems in this area. Some of the development problems in this region are as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of life of the community is not yet optimal. Although in the last 10 years, the Human Development Index has increased, this area is still in the middle caste of the 24 regencies/cities in South Sulawesi. The problem of the poverty rate, although it has decreased </span><span class="font1">e-ISSN 2407-392X. p-ISSN 2541-0857</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">from 7.53 percent (2019) to 7.38 percent (2020), however, the quality of poverty has not changed. Efforts to reduce poverty, create job opportunities, and improve the quality of human resources. This includes issues of access and service quality as well as pro-people, pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-poor, and pro-environment programs.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional economy is not yet optimal. Although a number of macroeconomic indicators have increased, such as; economic growth, increase in GRDP, income per capita, the amount of public saving, investment, but it does not guarantee the creation of a proportional distribution of income. Most of the people still have low to middle income. High-income groups are still enjoyed by a small part of the population. Therefore, high economic growth on the one hand needs to be accompanied by the movement of the real sector, especially sectors that absorb a lot of labor, such as agriculture, mining and the manufacturing industry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability of adequate infrastructure is still limited. Infrastructure in Gowa Regency is still limited. Although the budget for the allocation is quite large, the coverage area of this area is very wide, plus nine of its areas are located in highlands full of ravines and cliffs. As a result, the existing infrastructure is not evenly distributed between regions, so there is a gap between the highlands and lowlands as well as urban and rural areas.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of sub-district, village and sub-district areas is not yet optimal. Because the regional development has not been evenly distributed, it also affects the service quality that is not yet excellent. The span of control that is too wide and high makes services to the community inefficient and ineffective. The types of public services that can be delegated to lower </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></a><span class="font1">121</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">authorities should only be carried out, namely from the district to the sub-district to the sub-district or village. Especially the strengthening of village institutions, as stated in Law Number 6 of 2014. Where, villages that manage large enough funds need to be supported by the readiness of the superstructure to be encouraged to become independent villages. The extent to which these funds are effective has an impact on improving the performance of the agricultural sector which in turn is able to improve the welfare of rural communities. In addition, how to minimize irregularities in the use of village finances due to limited capacity, quality and accountability of human resources, especially in rural areas.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of good governance is not yet optimal. The quality of public services still requires improvement, especially in the integrated service system for licensing and investment. Bureaucratic capacity is still relatively low, especially with regard to institutional and management issues, utilization of information technology, information systems and e-government which are not yet integrated and comprehensive.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Topography and Climate as Basis for River Tourism</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The topography of Gowa Regency is mostly hilly highlands, which is about 72.26% covering 9 sub-districts, namely Parangloe, Manuju, Tinggimoncong, Kun-cio Pao, Parigi, Bungaya, Bontolempan-gan, Tompobulu and Biringbulu sub-districts. The remaining 27.74% are lowlands with flat topography covering 9 sub-districts, namely Somba Opu, Bontomarannu, Pattallassang, Pallangga, Barombong, Ba-jeng, West Bajeng, Bontonompo and South Bontonompo sub-districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of the total area of Gowa Regency, 35.30% has a land slope above 40 degrees, namely in the Parangloe, Tinggimoncong, Bungaya, Bontolempangan and Tompo-bulu sub-districts. With the shape of the topography of the area which is mostly highlands, the Gowa Regency area is traversed by 15 large and small rivers which have great potential as a source of electricity, irrigation and river tourism objects. One of the largest rivers in South Sulawesi is the Jeneberang river with an area of 881 Km2 and a length of 90 Km. Above the Jeneber-ang river flow by the Gowa Regency Government in collaboration with the Government of Japan, has built the Bili-Bili DAM multifunction project with an area of + 2,415 Km2 which can provide irrigation water covering an area of + 24,600 ha, clean water consumption (PAM) for the people of Gowa and Makassar Regencies of 35,000,000 m3 and for hydroelectric power plants with a power of 16.30 Mega Watts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on this, the principles and concepts of tourism development in Gowa Regency are prepared with reference to a number of important points mentioned above, coupled with an international tourism perspective in encouraging the development of Gowa Regency tourism at an international standard. The arrangement is at the same time in order to build the ideology and concepts that become the basis for formulating the direction of tourism development in Gowa Regency in accordance with the functions that have been determined by the central government (based on the Regulation of the Minister of Tourism Number 10 of 2016), so that consistency in tourism development in Gowa Regency is also achieved. Contributive Gowa Regency starts at the regional (provincial), national, and even international levels. Thus, the principles of tourism development in Gowa Regency are based on three main principles that are considered important in accordance with a number of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">considerations set out in each relevant regulation. The three principles are; first, community-based and local wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this case, the tourism development of Gowa Regency emphasizes the community base sector and carries the values of local wisdom that exist and develop in the community. In addition, the people of Gowa Regency are also positioned not only as objects but also subjects in their tourism development. Second, Integrative. In this case, Gowa Regency always optimizes its role actively in achieving goals and standards that apply at the provincial, national, and international levels. Thus, tourism in Gowa Regency is expected to contribute not only to Gowa Regency itself, but in real terms it can contribute significantly to the development of tourism around and at various levels. Fourth, sustainable. In this case, the tourism development of Gowa Regency in principle must prioritize important aspects that are in accordance with sustainable tourism. This is in order to preserve the resources owned in this area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the three existing development principles, the concept of tourism development in Gowa Regency will focus on the basic sectors in its community while still referring to and carrying out the values of local wisdom that exist and develop and make the people of Gowa Regency the subject of tourism development. The tourism development is compiled collectively by referring to every effort to achieve goals and standards that apply at the provincial, national, and international levels in ensuring the role and contribution of tourism in Gowa Regency broadly. In addition, the tourism development of Gowa Regency is also structured by upholding sustainability aspects as the main principle in ensuring that its tourism development has a positive impact on the environment and its territory in the long term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the Minister of Tourism Regulation Number 10 of 2016, it is </span><span class="font1">e-ISSN 2407-392X. p-ISSN 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">explained that district tourism destinations are tourism destinations in which there are tourist attractions that have a suitability of district/city scale themes (provincial competitiveness) and have been determined to be the authority of the district/city. The tourism destination plan is a direction for the development of tourism destinations in the tourism zoning system which consists of two parts, namely:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determination of the scope of the Gowa Regency Tourism Destination (DPK) area; and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determination of the Gowa Regency Strategic Tourism Area (KSPK) and Gowa Regency Tourism Development Area (KPPK) which later became the direction for the development of Gowa Regency tourism destinations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The Gowa Regency Tourism Destinations (DPK) were determined by taking into account several things, namely the National RTRW, RIPPARNAS, RTRW of South Sulawesi Province, RIPPARPROV</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of South Sulawesi, and RTRW of Gowa Regency. In addition to observing several documents, the determination of Gowa TPF is mainly made on the basis of similar characteristics of tourism attractiveness, as mentioned in Chapter 4 regarding tourism destinations. The following are the tourism areas of Gowa Regency with their respective themes:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ecotourism area of Malino and its surroundings with the theme of adventure ecotourism and agrotourism;</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2">The research area is located in the Biroro River Area, Bontolerung Subdistrict, Tinggimoncong District, which is located 65 km from the administrative area of Gowa Regency, South Sulawesi Province. Consists of highlands and valleys with a slope of above 40%. The main source of the Biroro River comes from the “Ketemu Match” waterfall which has a land area of about 3ha. The river winds its way through several neighborhoods in the Bontolerung Village, before ending at Takapala Waterfall in the same village. The length of the river flow, from the Ketemu Mate Waterfall in the Biror neighborhood to the Takapala waterfall in the Bontolerung neighborhood is about 1000 meters. Of course, this is a natural resource potential that is very useful.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The Biroro river area in Bontolerung which is flanked by highlands, valleys, and hills with natural vegetation cover in the form of forests, cabbage, mustard and potato vegetable plantations, and rice fields is a complementary attraction with the features of the “Ketemu Match” waterfall and the “Takapala” waterfall. &quot;&nbsp;This view can be enjoyed, from the main access to Bontolerung Village, from entering Malino City, then turning east, to the trekking route to the waterfall location, it takes 15 minutes to get to Biroro village, as a visitor distribution point. Along the way, there is the potential for natural and cultivated plant species developed by the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tourism support facilities such as lodging/homestays are adequate. However, the facilities for restaurants and stalls are still in the pilot stage. The number of inn/homestay hotels in Bulutana Village and Bontolerung Village is around 32 units, with the highest price of IDR 1,600,000 per night and the lowest price of IDR 250,000 per night. However, there are also resorts that rent up to IDR 7,000,000 per night including meals. Usually this is for family gathering classes. But unfortunately, the road infrastructure is not supportive. The road is still narrow, so when</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the volume of vehicles increases, traffic jams will quickly occur.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Social Resources</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">One of the main elements in tourism institutions is tourism human resources (HR). Tourism HR is an important element because of its role as a provider of labor in the tourism industry. The available, competent, and reliable tourism human resources are certainly a driving force for tourism development in Gowa Regency, so it needs to be a concern for policy makers. Based on data obtained from Disparbud in the last six years, it shows a consistent increase in the workforce in the tourism sector in Gowa Regency. However, when viewed from the side of growth in the last three years, it tends to decline (see Table 2). In a survey conducted by Local Government (Logov, 2021) on 45 business actors operating in Gowa Regency, it was found that the majority of business actors absorbed less than five workers (51.11%), followed by the category of employment of 5-20 people (31.11%). The results of this survey indicate that employment in the tourism industry in Gowa Regency relies on small to medium scale businesses.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Bureauro River Development Strategy in Bontolerung</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The Biroro river area in Bontolerung to the Takapala waterfall can be developed as a natural tourism area based on experiential tourism, which is a tourist area that provides flexibility for visitors to explore the area with a family adventure approach, agro and education. This principle is in line with several studies on the development of tourist areas in different destinations (Me-acci &amp;&nbsp;Liberatore, 2018; Serdane et al; 2020). This development scenario is realized through the packaging of activities as follows. 1) Trekking, which is exploring the Biroro river flow with the Takapala waterfall as the final destination. It can also be expanded by exploring thematic paths of geology, botany and river ecosystems; 2) Agro Adventures, namely the packaging of tourist activities exploring protected forests and tea plantation areas (Malino High land), vegetable plantations in the Pat-tapang and Kanreapia highlands to get to know various types of plants, bird watching and enjoying the processed products of local vegetable plantations with vegetarian culinary activities as the main attraction; 3) Automotive tourism by developing offroad motorcycle lanes with separate lanes from non-motorcycle activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To support the packaging, the pattern of area development is divided into at least three, namely: 1) core zone: covering the Ketemu Jodoh Waterfall and the Biroro river as the main attractions and binding tourist activities in the core area; 2) buffer </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">zone: includes a buffer area from the Biroro river flow which is used in a limited manner by prioritizing the preservation of ecological functions and the spread of tourism activities to reduce the burden on the core zone; 3) development zone: an area that is reserved as a zone for the development of activities and facilities in the future; 4) support zone: an area used as a distribution point for visitors, commercial facilities and a visit circulation center area located at the front/entrance area of the Area. The recommended circulation of visits is by loop-line and back-trecking where the flow of incoming and outgoing visitors uses one access gate that is currently available. On the inside, different circulation paths are arranged between the paths leading to the core zone and exiting the core zone. This is done to reduce the impact of the density of visiting activities within the Area, spread tourism activities and optimize the visiting experience (Morrison, 2013; Albrecht, 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the management aspect, a management strategy is recommended by strengthening the function of the Bontolerung River Ecotourism Management Community group which has now been formed through Community Service activities carried out by LPPM Unhas, in accordance with the principles of community-based tourism (Khalid et al., 2019). Institutional strengthening can be pursued through the following strategies: 1) the establishment of a tourism object management community that is built through the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">synergy of the community, local government and universities, by strengthening its formal juridical aspects; 2) training to increase human resource capacity gradually, starting with visitor service training, OHS and Business training; 3) strengthening the inclusion of the tourism supply chain by prioritizing products from within the Bontolerung Village and Bulutana Village, Tinggimoncong Subdistrict, Gowa Regency.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The Biroro River area in Bontolerung can be developed as a natural tourism area with the theme of experiential tourism, which is a tourist area that gives visitors the flexibility to explore the area with a family adventure approach, agro and education. In the management aspect, a management strategy is recommended by strengthening the functions of the Bontolerung Tourism Awareness Group and the Bontolerung River Ecotourism Management Community which are currently newly formed. The model for developing river-based tourism activities on the Biroro Bontolerung river is directed to a sustainable community-based tourism development model (Kahlid et al; 2019).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To achieve this, the development approach does not rely on government initiatives, but can elaborate on the interests and interests of each stakeholder. This study has provided an information regarding tourism resources in the Biroro Bontolerung River Area and contributed to the enrichment of applied science of tourism management as a consideration for tourism development in Tinggimoncong District, Gowa Regency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The limitation of this research is that it has not revealed the technical aspects of physical, service, and operational planning. This provides an opportunity for further research that will make an important</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">contribution to the object of research. In the aspect of community empowerment, this research provides an opportunity for applied research in the form of a guide to the activation of social and cultural elements in the development of the Bontolerung and Bulutana areas.</span></p>
