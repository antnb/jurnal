<p><span class="font1">This study was aimed to identify and analyze the meaning and message in several sentences found in the novel </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rage of Angels </span><span class="font1">by Sidney Sheldon published in 1980. The selected sentences in the novel, which are the data of this study, were collected by applying the documentation method and note-taking technique which then were analyzed using the descriptive qualitative method. The data were presented informally in descriptive form. This study analyzes the types of meaning based on the theory proposed by Leech (1974) and the messages of the novel based on the biographical approach theory by Wellek and Warren (1962). As a result, all the seven types of meaning, namely connotative meaning, conceptual meaning, affective meaning, stylistic meaning, reflected meaning, collocative meaning, and thematic meaning, were found in the novel. In relation to the message of the novel, based on the biographical approach, there were five messages that the author delivered.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The language used by people on daily basis always contains meaning. It is the message people deliver and try to understand successfully. As Leech (1974) stated that there are seven types of meaning namely conceptual meaning, connotative meaning, stylistic meaning, affective meaning, reflected meaning, collocative meaning, and thematic meaning, an understanding of meaning is importantly needed in order to avoid misunderstanding which is the failure of communication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On a certain occasion, people interpret differently the message of someone else which contributes to a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">different understanding. This is an unfortunate condition because the intended message is not properly delivered. This condition may happen both in conversational and textual forms of communication and is caused either because people do not comprehend the meaning of the sentences or the sentences contain meaning that cannot be interpreted lexically. Customarily, this condition occurs in literary works as the words within sentences often have different meanings from dictionaries. One of the literary works that such a condition may occur is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rage of Angels</span><span class="font3">, a novel written by Sidney Sheldon in 1980. The sentences in the novel hint at</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">meanings that cannot be interpreted purely from dictionaries, therefore a study about meaning in the novel is essential according to the foregoing explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Furthermore, the meanings of the sentences found in the novel form a message as a whole of the novel. Meaning and message have a function as a moral value to the reader. The author displays messages directly or indirectly in the depiction of a story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This study focuses on identifying the meanings found in the sentences based on Leech’s theory of meaning (1974) as well as the message in the novel using the biographical approach proposed by Wellek and Warren (1962). A similar topic has been researched previously, however, what differs current study to previous studies is the range of meaning that is analyzed which is broader as many past researches only discuss certain meaning.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>METHOD AND THEORY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The data of this study are the sentences in the novel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rage of Angels </span><span class="font3">written by Sidney Sheldon published in 1980. The novel was chosen as the data source because it has the data relating to the aims of the study that is to find out the types of the meanings and the messages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The method used in collecting the data related to the subject of this research is library research by using documentation and note-taking technique. The data was collected by marking, selecting, and identifying the types of meanings to be processed in the next step. The collected data were then analyzed using the descriptive qualitative research method. The data were analyzed using the theory from Leech (1974), to find out the types of meanings in the novel. Second, the messages are explained using the theory of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">biographical approach proposed by Wellek and Warren (1962). This study specifically was presented in the descriptive qualitative method. It means that the analysis is presented in the form of sentences. The result of the analysis was explained descriptively in order to make it clear and easy for the reader to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are three theories applied in this study. The first is the theory of meaning by Leech (1974) that divides meaning into seven types namely conceptual meaning, connotative meaning, stylistic meaning, affective meaning, reflected meaning, collocative meaning, and thematic meaning. Connotative meaning is the communicative value an expression has by virtue of what it refers to, over and above its purely conceptual content; (2) Conceptual meaning, is the rational sense of the utterance and is identified as a basic component of grammatical competence, (3) Stylistic Meaning, a meaning in which a piece of language conveys about the social circumstances in which the utterance takes place, (4) Affective Meaning, a meaning that can reflect the personal feeling of the speakers, including the attitude of the speaker to the listener, (5) Reflected Meaning, a meaning which occurs in cases of multiple meaning when a sense of a word forms part of our response to another sense, (6) Collocative Meaning, the association of a word that acquires the account of the meaning of a word which tends to occur in its environment, (7) Thematic Meaning, which is communicated by how the speaker or the writer organizes the message, in terms of the order, focus and emphasis. This theory was used to identify the meanings found in the data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second theory was applied to support the analysis of meaning. It is theory of context of the situation by</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Halliday and Hasan (1985). In order to construct the meaning from the sentences, context from the story is very much needed. Using the theory, the meaning can be more precise to be interpreted as the situation is known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The third theory to analyze the message in the novel is the biographical approach by Wellek and Warren (1962). This approach is used in order to understand the message of the novel and understand the reason and intention of the writer. It is believed that an artist in general always gets most of their inspiration from their own life's situation. Sidney Sheldon is always known for his bold move and his strong image as a novel writer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The topic of meaning like this study has been done previously. Asril (2013) did a research entitled Imagery and Figurative Language in Jimi Hendrix’s Song Lyrics. The similarity between these studies is the method used. The difference to the current study is the previous study focused on imageries while current study focuses on the meaning. Another research related to this study is entitled Connotative and Denotative Meanings of Lyrics by Tina Arena’s Songs written by Zulaichah (2008). The difference between her study to current study is her study applied one theory by George Yule, whereas this study used three theories by Leech, J.N Hook, and Nordquist R. Pramedio’s research entitled The Figurative Language Function, Meaning, and Rhyme in the Poem When I Was One and Twenty (2009). The relevance of her thesis to this current study is the usage of Leech’s theory and also Warren and Wellek’s theory (1962) to find the meaning in their corresponding literature piece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are also two articles from international journal that had done research on the similar topic. The article</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">is written by Abdallah (2015) entitled Going beyond the Conventions: The connotations of Setting in Thomas Hardy's the Return of the Native. The theory applied in this article was proposed by Leech (1980). The relevance to this study is the similarity of focusing on the messages in the literature piece. Another article is written by Saifuddin (2018) entitled Denotative and Connotative Meaning of Signs in Lombok Musical Instrument (Gendang Beleq) published in International Journal of English Literature and Social Sciences. The main theory applied in this article was proposed by Roland Barthes theory about relation between signifier and signified. The relevance to this study is the focus on connotative meaning as one of the meaning identified on this study.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>The Message in the Novel </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rage of Angels</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">In the novel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rage of Angels</span><span class="font3">, there are five messages that can be determined using the biographical approach theory. The messages are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(1) Never give up and be in despair even in difficult condition because being sad over something is not a solution. (2) Do not be arrogant and hate someone because hatred brings awful situation. (3) Do not accuse people carelessly and learn to trust someone better. Slander can damage one’s reputation and also one’s dignity just like how Jennifer was ostracized by society for crimes she never made at all. Trusting someone is the key to a good cooperative relationship. (4) Help your fellow humans without strings attached because helping fellow human beings is an obligation as social beings regardless of the degree of human beings to each other. (5) Rise from failure and move on without looking at the past: It is the best way to forgive past events and continue our lives better.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the foregoing analysis in this study, there are some points to conclude. Related to the meanings found in data, there were 21 connotative meanings, 13 conceptual meanings, 16 stylistic meanings, 16 affective meanings, 13 reflective meaning, 4 collocative meanings, and 18 thematic meanings. The most occuring meaning is connotative. The reason behind this finding is because the object of the study itself is a literary work in which the language has some stylistic features. One of the features is connotative meaning. Whereas, the least occuring meaning is collocative. This happens because the choice of words within the novel explores more about meaning beyond the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">dictionary, thus collocative meaning, which is closely related to association of words based on dictionary, is limited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Relating to the message of the novel, there are five messages that the author of the novel delivered to the reader. Two of the messages are about motivation to always be strong. The other three are about guidance in social life, thus peace is always around those who are kind and helpful.</span></p>
