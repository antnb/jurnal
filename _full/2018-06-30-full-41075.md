<p><span class="font4">The abundance of coconut waste in North Sulawesi has not been processed and used optimally, then it becomes waste for the environment. Coconut coir processing for planting medium is limited only for coconut peat (coconut husk powder). One drawback in processing coconut peat requires special equipment and the fuel is expensive. This study aimed to compare the use coconut peat and coconut coir as growing medium for white oyster mushroom. Coconut coir was cut 3cm x 2cm x 1cm in size, while the comparison medium uses a coconut peat. Compositions of both media are coconut coir / coconut peat 83%, 16% ricebran, 1% limestone, 60% water. The result showed that coconut coir more productive than coconut peat. Coconut coir media produces 120.62 grams while the coconut peat media weighing 116.11 grams on each harvesting. Based on the result it can be conclude the usage of coconut coir was better compare than coconut peat for cultivation of oyster mushroom.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>BACKGROUND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">North Sulawesi province has coconut plantation area of 263,744.69 hectares in 2009, there was an increase to 266,147.36 hectares in 2010, and become 267,350.79 hectares in 2011 (Pakasi, 2013). The coconut husk mostly uses as fuel for the copra processing. This process cause increasing of CO2 levels. The coconut husk which is not utilized optimally will become waste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The coconut husk is a waste of coconut plantations that have a lot of potential include: 1) as a briquetting (Nurhadi, 2014), 2) as a geopolymer replacement for cement (Maulidah et al., 2013), and 3) as a medium to grow plants (Hasibuan et al., 2016 and Awang et al., 2009). Coconut husk has nutrients that are environmentally friendly, but as a growing medium its needs to be neutralized using zeolite and dolomite (Tyas, 2000). Cocopeat as a medium for cultivation of oyster mushroom (P.ostreatus) was tested by Astuti</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and Kuswytasari in 2013, while Nurilla et al. (2013) used it as a medium of wood ear mushroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mushrooming or mushroom cultivation refers to the intentional and direct production of mushroom, subtituting wild collection in the field and forests with a harvest in defined condition of growing, resulting in strict quality control, food safety without risk of consumption of poisonous or toxic species, also the guarantees of benefit generated by these fungi (Zied et al, 2011).White oyster mushroom (P. ostreatus) is an excellent option to be cultivated by its natural characteristic. P. ostreatus is easy to cultivate and can be harvested in a month (Ginting et al., 2013). Oyster mushrooms are easiest and least expensive commercial mushroom to grow because they are well known for conversion of crop residues to food protein (Bandopadhyay, 2013), it has delicious taste, high nutritional as well as a good selling pricebecause the cultivation process is relatively simple and inexpensive cultivation technique (De Sequiera, 2011 and Sanchez, 2010). Oyster mushrooms cultivation using colonize bag containing nutrients and media such as sawdust, rice bran, gypsum (CaSO4) and agricultural lime (CaCO3) (Reyeki, 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">White oyster mushroom cultivation in Indonesia established using sawdust. Nowadays the demand of white oyster mushroom as food is increasing, but the source of saw dust was decreasing by the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">References of the coconut husk utilization as oyster mushrooms growth media is still limited in coconut husk powder or coconut peat shape. Coconut peat was made by processing coconut husks into coconut fiber using the machine. Utilization of pieces of coconut husk (coconut coir) is unavailable, so this research purposes to compare the utilization of coconut peat and coconut coir as white oyster mushroom growing medium.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Inoculation and incubation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">After cooling stage, the media were inoculated with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">P.ostreatus</span><span class="font4"> (F2 as spawn). Inoculation of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">P.ostreatus </span><span class="font4">done by put 15 seed from F2 isolate of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">P.ostreatus</span><span class="font4"> into</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The research was conducted on April to august 2015, at laboratory of Environment and Forestry Research and Development Institute of Manado, Indonesia. Both coconut coir and coconut peat were collected from the environment of the coconut plantation in Manado City. Coconut coir was prepared by cutting the coconut husk manually into small pieces using a knife. The cutting technique was done crosswise fibers with a size of approximately 3 cm x 2cm x 1cm (Figure 1). While the coconut peat taken from coconut fiber factory, it was prepared by mechanical chopping using machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The experiment using a completely randomized design with replicates of 10 times for each ingredient. The parameters observed were the growth rate of mycelium, the growth of fruit body and the mean harvest weight of the cartilage and the total harvest of each material tested during the harvest period. Variant analyzes were performed on growth rate of mycelium, growth of fruit body and number of pinheads appearing using F test, while the Mann-Whitney test was used on the weight of the harvest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This experiment using coconut coir as the main ingredient of the media. For comparation it also use the growth media mad of coconut peat as main ingredient. Both of growing media was added with other ingredient there are ricebran, limestone and water. Based on previous study in laboratory, composition of media are 83% the main ingredient, 16% ricebran, 1% limestone. Limestone is the raw material as a source of calcium (Ca) and allows to adjust the level of acidity (pH) media. The optimal acidity for growth mushroom is 5.5-6.5. Lime used are agricultural lime (CaCO3). The content of calcium and carbon are necessary for growth of mushrooms as well as it increase the value of nutrition. All components were mixed carefully and 50-60% water were added from total weight of media, or depend on the humidity level of the media. After mixed well, media were filled into the heat resistant plastic bag (0.2 x 14 cm x 30 cm in size). Each colonize bag was filled with 700 g media. The colonize bag was sterilized using autoclave on 121oC, 1 atm pressure. Each colonize bag could be harvested for 3 times with optimal yield production on the first and second time of harvesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">each colonize bag. The colonize bag was tied up using plastic pipe and cover it with paper. All the colonize bags were incubated in the dark place with 27<sup>o</sup>C-28<sup>o</sup>C for three weeks. The research was designed and arranged with 20 replications for each treatment.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Cultivation condition</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">After the colonize bag were full with mycelia during incubation, it was transferred to cropping room. The environmental at cropping room was kept illuminated by sunlight, good air circulation and humidity. Watering was done twice a day in the morning and 36</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">afternoon because the weather in Manado mostly warm with temperature about 30<sup>o</sup>C.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Harvesting</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The harvesting of mushroom was done after the formation of mushroom had completed. Formation of complete mushroom, especially its body fruit was occurred in a week after the colonize bag had been transferred into the cropping room. A clean scapel was used to detach fruitbodies at the base of stipe from the colonize bag. Weight of the fruiting bodies were recorded for analysis purposes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DISCUSSION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Growth of mycelium and fruiting body production</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Coconut coir as growth media was more effective and economic than coconut peat. Based on the parameters of mycelial growth, both media coconut coir and coconut peat showed same mycelial growth at the beginning. Mycelial growth is the beginning formation of the fungal fruiting bodies. Mycelial growth was influenced by substrate that was used as a growth medium of fungus (Alemu, 2014). Mycelial growth peak occurs when mycelia are able to meet the colonize bag. In this experiment, the colonize bags were fully filled by mycelium on the 30<sup>th</sup> day after inoculation. The growth of mycelia is highly influenced by nutrient contained in the media. White oyster mushroom needs cellulose, lignin, carbohydrates and glucose (Sharma </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al., </span><span class="font4">2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fruiting body is the edible part of white oyster mushroom, both of the media tested are able to produce the fruiting body of the mushrooms. The primordia formation on both growth media were appeared at 33 days after inoculating, or 3 days after the colonize bag was transferred from incubation room to the cropping room. The primordia formation was affected by humidity and media subtrate (Alemu, 2014). The opening lid of colonize bag performed on the 30<sup>th</sup> day after</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">inoculation, when the mycelia was colonized whole bag. The number of pin head in first day are more than 7 pin heads / bags and the end for each colonize bag for a harvesting period was 7 pin heads per colonize bag (Figur 5). The observation of veil growth has done on the first day when the fruiting body blossom into a veil with a minimum diameter of 3 cm to 7 cm (Figure 5) be the fruiting body which ready for harvest. The growth of fruiting body begins with formed of primordia which generally six days after the lid is opened and colonize bags are moved from the incubation chamber into cultivation chamber with watering and light intensity settings.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Morphology</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Coconut coir proved more effective as a growth medium for oyster mushroom, because it has similar morphology to the host tree of white oyster mushrooms in their natural habitat. Naturally, both coconut coir and coconut peat contain materials that required for growth of oyster mushrooms, there are lignin (45.8%), cellulose (43.4%), hemicellulose (10.25%), pectin (3.0%) (Astuti and Kuswytasari, 2013), however, coconut peat has been separated from the fiber form in which some ingredients have been reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Natural characteristics of coconut peat are good in holding water for humidity maintenance that suitable as a growing medium (Sudomo, 2012). The structure and shape of coconut coir makes it possible to store the water more than coconut peat, which has become a powder. Moreover, the coconut coir shapes is better than coconut</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">39</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">peat to keep it moist. Maintaining the humidity causes better growth, included long-mycelial growth, veil diameter and produced more yield in each harvesting. Morphologically, the veil of white oyster mushrooms produced at the harvesting is not visible contrast between the white oyster mushroom grown on coconut coir media compare to coconut peat media.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on fruiting body production, mushrooms which cultivated on coconut coir showed optimal productivity. The growth of white oyster mushroom fruiting bodies on the coco coir media occurred at 3 to 8 days after the lid of colonize bag was opened. This research showed the growth of fruiting bodies using coconut coir media had an average diameter of 7.96 cm and weight of 120.62 g each colonize bag at once harvesting. For comparison, the growth fruiting body on coconut peat media had an average diameter of 7.46 with an average harvest is 116.11 g for each colonize bag. As comparison, cultivation of white oyster mushroom on saw dust (700 g colonize bag) provides 6,57 cm of veil diameter in average and 58.71 g yield each harvesting with three days interval of harvesting (Hariadi </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font4">., 2013). Gonzalez and Catarino (2009) conclude that alkaline water could increase the yield for 40% than fresh water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fruiting bodies production in an industrial mushroom cultivation also affected by provision of fertilizer and insecticide. Saputri (2013) reported that the addition of 1% dolomite was the best treatment in pink oyster mushroom production. This treatment was an organic cultivation of mushrooms without addition of any chemical component.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on observations of oyster mushroom growth on two different growth media, it was known that the coconut coir showed different characteristics compared to coconut peat. Coconut peat shape as a husk, it is similar in size, more fiber, easy to dry, less humid, colonize bags are denser than made from coconut coir. Cocout coir has more fibrous, it has less different in size because it is manually cutting, more humid because its better in keep the water storage, but it less dense compare to coconut peat colonize bag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The observations result showed that the coconut coir media was able to make the mycelia sticking stronger and the mushroom fruit does not easily shake (Figure 7.a). It is suspected that coconut coir has a resemble shape to a tree trunk or weathered wood where white oyster mushroom grows as a parasite on the natural habitat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The coconut coir medium for white oyster mushrooms are ecological friendly since it is reduce the agricultural waste in the environment, and it is economically because does not need to pay for the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">source and does need expensive equipment to make it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>CONCLUSIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Coconut coir is an excellent preference as white oyster mushroom growth medium compared to coconut peat because it gives better results proved optimal mycelial growth at day 28 length of 14.5 cm and an average harvest weighing 120.62 grams each colonize bag in one harvest.</span></p>
