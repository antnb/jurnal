<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Information technology is increasingly sophisticated has provided various conveniences for humans, this causes changes in the mindset and habits of modern society in carrying out activities of daily life [1]. The total population in Bali Province is 4.36 million people and internet users in Bali in 2020 ranks 16th with a total of 3,411,084 internet users, it can be concluded that almost 80% of Bali's population uses the Internet in daily life. Internet use also affects people's shopping habits, especially those who have internet access done online via a smartphone [2]. In the second quarter of 2020 where the Covid-19 pandemic has hit the whole countries including</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Indonesia which causes many people to lose their jobs due to social restrictions that have a hard impact on the community's economy. Some e-commerce also experienced an increase in sales due to this pandemic, one of which was Shopee. Shopee experienced an increase in sales in the second quarter of 2020 and became the most popular e-commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The purchase of fashion products has actually increased, the causative factor is important to study. This study also analyzes the data that has been obtained from the results of the questionnaire by using the data mining method on the RapidMiner application that this study does not only display statistics obtained from the results of the questionnaire data. Data mining is very important to do because it can find out the added value of data mining a collection of data in the form of knowledge that has not been known manually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Advertising is an important part of marketing activities seen by consumers[3]. Advertisements appear and are seen by the public, marketing is often interpreted as advertising. Television, radio, newspapers or internet media advertising becomes a menu that appears every day and in large numbers. Almost every second and minute advertisements color these media, and are captured by the audience. The Shopee My Advertisement feature is also one of the online marketing strategies carried out by Shopee in marketing products, besides that advertisements also provide several attractive offers and price discounts that cause users to become interested in making purchases on the Shopee application. Research that brand awareness can affect advertising on a product, indicates that brand awareness can be a variable that mediates the effect of advertising on product purchasing decisions [4].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The purpose of this study is to test the effect Iklanku Shopee feature on purchasing decisions and brand awareness of fashion products on the Shopee application. Knowing the results of clustering on this research data that it can find out the best cluster and the results of the classification comparison of the Naive Bayes algorithm and the K-NN algorithm. Limitation of the problem in this study is the measurement of product purchase decisions in the Shopee application is limited to the purchase of fashion products, Shopee users in question are Shopee users in the Denpasar area, given the limitations of researchers and Denpasar area where the majority of the population has often used digital technology in their daily life. Data clustering using the K-Means algorithm method and classification using Naive Bayes and K-NN algorithms. K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) is a classification algorithm based on the similarity of its nearest neighbors, and is usually used for classification problems. The advantage of the K-NN method is that it is easy to use, effective and efficient, it can provide good results. The classification of similarity results is obtained based on the closest distance between the data sample and the object [5]. The advantages of the KNN method are quite simple, popular, effective, and efficient. The KNN method is applied frequently and gives good results. Similar objects are classified in the same category [6].</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Rule of thumb Inner Model is R Square 0,67:0,33 and 0,19. Changes in the value of R-squares are used to explain the effect of the exogenous latent variable on the endogenous latent variable, whether it has a substantive effect. The value of R square is used to find the value of Q square. The value of Q square must be &gt;0 [12].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Outer model is used to find the value of the validity and reliability of the data. Inner model to predict causality between latent variables by using bootstrapping, T-statistic test parameters obtained to determine there is a causal relationship. Evaluation of the structural model is evaluated through the R2 test, if the result of R2 is greater than 0.2, it can be said that the latent predictor has a major influence on the structural level. The R-square on the PLS model can be evaluated with the Q-square which can measure how well the observed values produced by the model and parameter estimates are [12].</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>3.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Discussion of Results and Methods</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">SPSS was used to find characteristic data from questionnaires that had been distributed based on age, gender, last education and occupation. Testing the instrument is testing the questionnaire statement which will be distributed.Testing using SPSS in research is also to find out the description of respondents' answers and the average answers given from respondents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The test using SEM PLS in this research is to find the value of the Outer Model and Inner Model. The value of the Outer Model is used to test convergent validity (measurements of a construct must be highly correlated), discriminant validity (measurements from different constructs must not be highly correlated). SEM PLS in this study is also used to find the value of the inner model. The results obtained between the two tests using SPSS and SEM PLS show that the validity and reliability tests are valid and reliable, so they are feasible to use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Analysis using clustering and classification algorithms aims to determine the classification of each parameter used to answer the statement, there are five parameters used to fill out the questionnaire. The results of the five-cluster test showed that the more parameters used, the smaller the Davies Bouldin value obtained so that the results were better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The comparison between the Naive Bayes classification algorithm and K-NN in the study shows that the Naive Bayes classification algorithm has higher accuracy results than using cross validation and split data methods. Predictions from using the Naive Bayes algorithm have prediction results that are not much different from the initial data, so that from the known prediction values that are not much different from the initial data, it can be stated that the Naive Bayes algorithm is more suitable for use in research and the Naive Bayes method can also produce results that high accuracy with little training data.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Result of clustering 350 data In this questionnaire, there are 5 clusters, namely cluster 0, cluster 1, cluster 2, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cluster</span><span class="font0"> 3, and cluster 4. The cluster validation test using Davies Bouldin got the results that the cluster 5 test got the best results. The result of classification in this study is the Naive Bayes algorithm has a more accurate accuracy value than the K-NN algorithm, this validation uses cross validation with k-folds 10 and split training data data is 0.8 and test data is 0.2. K on the K-NN used in each validation process is 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Prediction results and accuracy of the Naive Bayes algorithm is higher than the K-NN algorithm. This shows that the Naive Bayes algorithm works optimally, to determine decisions from prior knowledge.</span></p>
