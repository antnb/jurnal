<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Abstract</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The aim of this study is to analyze the four types of interferences; syntax, semantics, copula, and redundant found in “Besakih Temple” short text. The data were collected through library research with the necessary note-taking and documentation. The method used in analyzing this study is qualitative method. The result showed that interferences found in the text are covering linguistic aspects. It is furthermore called the negative transfer due to the result of contact with another language. The most common source of errors is lack of knowledge of the speaker about the language being used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Keywords</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">: interference, copula, redundant.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>I INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It is commonly said that due to the differences in culture between one and another language, the interference may occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on “A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics” (Crystal, 1991:80), “Interference is a term used in Sociolinguistics and Foreign Language Learning to refer to the errors a speaker introduces into one language as a result of contact with another language. It is also called negative transfer”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Weinreich (1953), “Language interference is the effect of a langauge learner’s first language on their production of the language they are learning. The effect can be on any aspect of language: grammar, vocabulary, accent, spelling, etc”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the book “Interferensi Pengaruh Bahasa Indonesia Dalam Bahasa Inggris”, the interference occurs because of the lack of information on each person in communicating in foreign language. According to Weinreich (1968) in his book Life with Two Language 1982:289), “the term interferencereferes to any different that may exist between the speech of a monolingual and that of a bilingual”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to thoroughly understand, the problem of interference attract me to find out with the question “What types of interference are found in the short text?”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>II MATERIALS AND METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">A short text “Besakih Temple” was taken from </span><a href="http://www.balistarisland.com/Bali-Interesting-Place/Besakih-Temple.htm"><span class="font3">http://www.balistarisland.com/Bali-Interesting-Place/Besakih-Temple.htm</span></a><span class="font3"> as the source of this article. The decision to use this material because the short text “Besakih Temple” consists of challenging types of interferences to be reconsidered. The data was collected through Observation and Reading to understanding the content. The theories of interferences used in analyzing the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">problems is based on the book “Interferensi: Pengaruh Bahasa Indonesia Dalam Bahasa Inggris” (Sudipa,et al 2011). The method used in analyzing the data was qualitative method. This qualitative method used in analyzing the data in the form of words, sentences, discourse, pictures, daily records, memorandum, or even tape recorder (Subroto, 1992:7).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>III RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The discussions are in the range of the interferences found in Besakih Temple short text. The types of interferences found in short text Besakih Temple are in the aspects of Syntax, Semantics, Copula, and Redundant. Below are the analysis of the types of interferences found in short text “Besakih Temple”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">3.1</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">yntax</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The interference in the term of syntax usually occurs because of the lack of understanding in morphological aspects. Here, I have found six sentences that belong to interference in syntax.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-1) It owns beautiful view from the top of temple area where we can see the wide nature panorama until to the ocean so that way this temple is many visited by tourists from all over the world.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">From the sentence above, it can be seen that the interference occurs in the word nature should be replaced into adjective natural, the words so that way should be replaced into so that’s why, and the words many visited by should be replaced into visited by many. The correct sentence should be: It owns beautiful view from the top of temple area where we can see the wide natural panorama until the ocean, so that’s why this temple is visited by many tourists from all over the world.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-2) He also commands to build the Blanjong Monument that is located in Sanur Village.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The word commands should be replaced by commanded because this sentence belongs to past tense, and the conjunction that is can be omitted. The correct sentence should be: He also commanded to build the Blanjong Monument located in Sanur Village.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-3) Besakih Temple beside as the altar for Hindu people in Bali, it is also as tourist destination which is a lot of visited by tourist.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In the sentence above, it is found that the interference found is in the terms of syntax, especially in preposition and conjunction aspect and also in the verb aspect. Here, the word beside should be placed in the beginning of the sentence and the words a lot of visited by tourist should be replaced into visited by a lot of tourists. The correct sentence should be: Besides as the altar for Hindu people in Bali, Besakih Temple also as tourist destination which is visited by a lot of tourists.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-4) In Hindu philosophy, Panca Dewata is manifestation of Siwa God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The article the need to be added between the words is and manifestation. The correct sentence should be: In Hindu philosophy, Panca Pandawa is the manifestation of Siwa God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-5) It is situated in cool area with the light breeze and unique temple buildings spread out in the temple complex will create the peaceful atmosphere.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The word which should be placed between the words buildings and spread, and the word will also need to be placed between the words complex and will. The correct sentence is: It is situated in cool area with the light breeze and unique temple buildings which spread out in the temple complex that will create the peaceful atmosphere.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-6) It is ideally for the people who did the meditation and now, the Besakih Temple is opened for tourist and it is the great place to visit in Bali.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The interference found in the sentence above is in the term of siyntax, where the verbs are important to be repaired into the correct form. The verb did should be replaced into do, the word now should be placed between is and opened and the words to visit should be replaced with to be visited. In order to create a good sentence, the sentence above should be replaced into: It is ideally for the people who do the meditation, and the Besakih Temple is now opened for tourist and it is the great place to be visited in Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The negative influence that caused by the interferences in the type of syntax is the lack of understanding in morphological aspects, for examples in the terms of noun, adjective, verb, and adverb.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">3.2</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">emantics</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In this case, the interferences found in the short text “Besakih Temple” are the interferences found in semantics way. I have found ten interferences from the aspect of semantics.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-7) It is because pursuant to Agung Mount confidence is holiest and highest mount in Bali Island.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The use of the words pursuant and confidence are based on the meaning found in dictionary and they need to be changed into another proper words. The words pursuant and confidence can be replaced into another words, they are appropriate and belief and the article the can be added. The correct sentence should be: It is appropriate to the belief that Mount Agung is the holiest and highest mount in Bali Island.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-8) It seems, the Besakih is coming from very old era which is far before the existence of Hinduism influence.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The words it seems can be replaced with it can be seen, and the words which is far can be omitted. The correct sentence should be: It can be seen that Besakih comes from the very old era before the existence of Hinduism influence.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-9) The Besakih Temple complex is built pursuant to cosmos balance.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The word pursuant is based on the meaning from the dictionary, to make a better sentence, the word pursuant can be replaced with in order, and the words to cosmos balance can be replaced into to balance the cosmos. The correct sentence should be: The Besakih Temple complex is built in order to balance the cosmos.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-10) It is based on the nature conception which is disseminating the fundamental temple complex that is arranged to pursuant of the way direction.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The words nature conception can be replaced into natural concept, where the word nature is changed into adjective natural. the words is disseminating are replaced into present continuous tense disseminates. the verb be also placed between the words to and pursuant, and the word way is replaced with route. The correct sentence should be: It is based on the natural concept which disseminates the fundamental temple complex that is arranged to be pursuant with the route direction.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-11) So, this building can deputize nature as symbolic of the world balance existence.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The word deputize is based on the meaning in dictionary, and it should be replaced with another better word from dictionary, represent. The adjective symbolic can be replaced with noun symbol, and the words world balance existence can be replaced with existence of world balance. The word can also can be omitted. The correct sentence is: So, this building represents nature as symbol of the existence of world balance.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-12) Besakih Temple is located in the plateau area which is covered by the cool atmosphere and Mount Agung as a back drop.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The interference found in the sentence above is the article a which should be replaced into article the and the word backdrop is replaced into background. The correct sentence should be: Besakih Temple is located in the plateau area which is covered by the cool atmosphere and Mount Agung as the background.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-13) From the top of temple building, we can see the beautiful panorama of nature from the temple area to the ocean.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The words panorama of nature are based on the dictionary and need to be changed into the better translated words. Here, the word nature as a noun can be replaced into adjective natural. The sentence should be: From the top of temple building, we can see the beautiful natural panorama from the temple area to the ocean.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-14) Like Penataran Agung Temple as center, we find in its courtyard conception show the solidarity conception between the original Indonesia culture namely tradition megalithic in form of Punden Berundak-undak with the Hinduism concept.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The sentence above are totally translated based on the dictionary or electronic dictionary and need to be repaired. The word solidarity can be replaced with similarity. Beside that, the writer also changes the verbs in the sentence that influences the reader in reading and understanding the text. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">correct sentence is as followed: Like Penataran Agung as center, we found its courtyard concept shows the similarity between the Hinduism concepts with the Indonesian original culture namely megalithic tradition in the form of Punden Berundak-undak.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-15) It is very easy to find this temple in Bali where most of the people have known it in particular the Balinese Hindu.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In order to make a better sentence, the word particular which based on the meaning in dictionary can be replaced with the word especially. The correct sentence is as followed: It is very easy to find this temple in Bali where most of the people have known it especially the Balinese Hindu.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-16) You may join the Besakih Temple Tour, the exciting tour package to visit the places of interest on the way to this temple.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The use of the words places of interest can be replaced with interesting places. so, the sentence can be changed into: You may join the Besakih Temple Tour, the exciting tour package to visit the interesting places on the way to this temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The negative influence of the analysis of interference in semantic way is the lack of understanding or miss understanding occurs toward the readers in terms of meaning. For example is the sentence number (3-14). There must be a different meaning between the words solidarity and similarity.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">3.3</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">opula</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In the book Interferensi Pengaruh Bahasa Indonesia dalam Bahasa Inggris, copula can be devided into three, they are the copula in terms of noun, verb, and adjective. Below are the analysis of interferences in the type of copula.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-17) Besakih Temple is the biggest Hindu temple in Bali which the local people call Pura Besakih.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In order to make the better sentence, the verb call should be replaced into is called. The sentence then can be replaced into: Besakih Temple is the biggest Hindu Temple in Bali which is called Pura Besakih by the local people.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-18) The Besakih’s name is come from the word of Basuki, the old language from Sanskrit Wasuki, and then it become the Ancient Java language.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In the sentence above, the copula in the words The Besakih’s can be omitted and changed into The Besakih. The preposition of can be omitted. The verb is come also should be replaced into comes, and the the word become in it become should be replaced with becomes. Based on this analysis, the sentence should be replaced into: The Besakih name comes from the word Basuki, the old language from Sanskrit Wasuki, and then it becomes the Ancient Java Language.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-19) In mythology of Samudramanthana has mentioned that Basuki is a dragon that twines the Mount Mandara.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The article the can be added between the word in and the word mythology, and verb been can be added after has. The correct sentence should be: In the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">mythology of Samudramanthana has been mentioned that Basuki is a dragon that twines the Mount Mandara.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The negative influence found in interference in the type of copula is the lack of understanding or miss understanding in the type of copula, especially in the terms of noun, verb, and adjective toward the readers. In even can cause miss of understanding or even information toward the readers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">3.4</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">edundant</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Redundant is used in interference in order to simplify the sentence by omitting the unnecessary word or words. Below are the redundants found in the short text Besakih Temple.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-20) In this Sanskrit, the Basuki means congratulation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The article the before the word Basuki can be omitted in order to simplify the sentence. Here, the word congratulation was translated based on the dictionary. so, in order to find the proper meaning, the word congratulation should be replaced with the word safe. The sentence then changed into: In this Sanskrit, Basuki means safe.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3-21) It is about 2 hours away from Bali’s International Airport by car to the east part of Bali and right located in Besakih Village, Rendang – Karangasem Regency.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The word Bali’s can be changed into Bali, and the word right can be omitted in order to simplify the sentence. Based on this analysis, the sentence can be changed into: It is about 2 hours awaf from Bali International Airport by car to the east part of Bali and located in Besakih Village, Rendang – Karangasem Regency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The negative influence occurs based on the interferences analysis in the terms of redundant is that the reader will feel weary to read too much and too long sentences in order to get the points. Number (3-20) is for example. The article the in sentence “In this Sanskrit, the Basuki means congratulation” can be omitted in order to simplify the sentence.</span></p>
