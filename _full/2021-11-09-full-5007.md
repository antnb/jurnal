<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deixis merupakan hubungan antara penggunaan struktur bahasa dan konteks dalam percakapan. Deixis fokus pada tanda bahasa atau struktur grammatikal dari konteks ujaran dalam percakapan dan interpretasi dari percakapan yang bergantung pada analisis dari konteks ujaran. Dalam setiap narrative teks seperti novel, terdapat banyak tanda-tanda deictcic yang menerapkan teori Levinson. Ada dua tujuan dalam penelitian ini, untuk mengidentifikasi dan mengklasifikasikan macam-macam deixis yang digunakan dalam novel The Rainbow Troops, untuk menyajikan dan menjabarkan presentase dari setiap tanda-tanda deictic yang digunakan dalam novel The Rainbow Troops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kata Kunci:Deixis, Bahasa, Deictic.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of study</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The single most obvious way in which languages are related is through phenomenon of deixis. Essentially, deixis is concerned with the way in which language is encoded or grammatical features of the context of utterance in the speech event, and is also concerned with the ways in the interpretation of utterances depends on the analysis of that context of utterance (Levinson, 1983).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many aspects of deixis are very pervasive in natural language, and deeply grammaticalized. For instance, the phenomenon of anaphora occurs when a deixis anchors to a previously mentioned entity. When it points to an entity that exists physically within speech environment, it is called deictic and phenomenon called cataphora occurs when it is used to refer to a forthcoming entity. One of the literary works, which consist of the encoding of many different aspects of utterance, is novel. In this study, “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow Troops”</span><span class="font1"> novel by Andrea Hirata was analyzed to find out the types of deixis. The novel was very interesting to analyze because it is a well-known and bestseller novel, which received many awards. It is the most favorite book of Indonesia, which is exported directly to International bookstores. This book also loved by many people because of its story tells about reality and education at that time. This novel also contains many types of deixis that have important value in the analysis of narrative text by using deixis theory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The method that was used in analyzing the data were qualitative descriptive, and quantitative methods. The analysis only focused on several sentences, which have representative values based on the proposed deixis types and the use of deictic markers. Those all classified based on Stephen C. Levinson theory,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in term of five types of deixis, where it belongs to and also was analyzed according to the anaphoric or cataphoric types. The quantitative method was used in analyzing the frequencies of the data, especially the frequencies of the deictic markers that occur in the novel. The percentages of deixis frequency were counted by dividing the number of a specific type of deixis and total of deixis times 100%.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Person deixis concerns the encoding of the role participant in the speech event in which utterance in question is delivered. In the novel, there was found three types of person deixis. Those are first person, second and third person deixis.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>a.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Person Deixis</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Being close to Lintang, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">felt like </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">was being challenged to run in a hundred-meter dash.</span><span class="font1"> (Page 12 line 13 to 14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the sentence above, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font1"> refers to the person who is currently speaking</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font1"> as deictic element indicate first person deixis. According to Levinson, this deictic element was categorized as singular first person pronoun. The deictic marker </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font1"> have role as the main character in the novel. The whole story only narrated and expressed by one speaker or</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">one person. Therefore, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font1"> here directly refers to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ikal,</span><span class="font1"> small boy Belitong Malay with curly hair.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>b.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Person Deixis</span></h1></li></ul>

That was a replacement for someone who has a role as addressee. The information about the deictic element of the personal pronoun can be seen in the previous discourse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“A Kiong stared hesitantly at Bu Mus, and then went back smiling. However, even though he had been asked repeatedly, A Kiong did not say one word. He just continued smiling. (Page 28, line 5 to 9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the description of the discourse above, the deictic references are referring to speaker and addressee. The speaker itself is Bu Mus and the addressee is A Kiong. That deictic element can be categorized as anaphoric deictic, in which the information about personal pronoun has been explained in a previous discourse.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">That is used for considering the gender of addressee especially for female. Here </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">she</span><span class="font1"> refers to Bu Mus who is the female teacher in the Muhammadyah Elementary School. The information about the personal deictic element can be seen in the discourse forthcoming. Therefore, this deictic element can be categorized as cataphoric deictic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“She had just graduated the week before from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sekolah Kepandaian Putri</span><span class="font1"> (Vocational Girl’s School), a junior high school in the capital of the regency, Tanjong Pandan.

<p><span class="font1">Time deixis concerns the encoding of temporal point and spans relative to the time at which an utterance was spoken.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The deictic adverb of time </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">toda</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">y</span><span class="font1"> means this day when the speaker delivers the utterance. This deictic element informed cataphorically in the story. The narrator informed the deictic element </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">today</span><span class="font1"> on relevant day-Wednesday, it can be seen in the following quoted text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“After much investigation, it turned out Kucai had joined up with kids from the neighboring village to become a pepper picker. Wednesday night, the night of payday, after studying the Koran at al-Hikmah mosque, Kucai pulled out a wad of money from behid his sarong.” (Page 343 line 8 to 13)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Place deixis concerns the encoding of spatial location relative to the location of the participants in the speech event. It is unit of measurement, or descriptions of direction and location.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">There were only three reasons why parents enrolled their children </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">here.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The word </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">here</span><span class="font1"> in the sentence indicated place deictic marker in the form locative adverb. It may represent such area or place where the speaker is present. The information of place was informed previously in the story, as it can be seen in the following quote text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font1">We were neighbors, and we were Belitong-Malays from the poorest community in the island. As for this school, Muhammadiyah Elementary School, it too was the poorest village school in Belitong. There were only three reasons why parents enrolled their children here.” (Page 4, line 1 to 5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By analyzing previous text, it can be identified that </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">here</span><span class="font1"> was used as reference of specific place. The specific place </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">here</span><span class="font1"> refers to where the members of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow Troops</span><span class="font1"> studied</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font1"> Therefore, the reference relates to Muhammadyah Elementary School.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Discourse deixis has to do with the encoding discourse in which the utterance is located. It is include the utterance itself and the expressions within some utterance to refer to some portion of the discourse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">It </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">was so beautiful.</span><span class="font1"> (Page 26, line 15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There was found the deictic reference </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font1"> that relates with some prior terms. This discourse deictic was informed anaphorically in the story. The information of the discourse deictic can be seen as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“When we asked question in class, he would run toward us in small steps, staring at us meaningfully with his calm eyes as if we were the most precious of Malay children. He whispered into our ears, fluently recited and Koranic verses, challenged, and then fell silent, like one daydreaming about a long lost love. (Page 26, line 9 to 15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By analyzing the previous text, the deictic referent </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font1"> here was used as reference of the situation in the class when Pak Harfan taught them. The members of the Rainbow Troops were happy and enjoy when Pak Harfan taught them. This deictic expression can be categorized as discourse deictic which is used for referring the prior statement made by the sentence, not to the sentence itself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In the sentence above can be seen Arabic term, which is used by the speaker as reference to open the speech. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘Assalamu’-alaikum</span><span class="font1"> means Peace be with you. It is a shortened form of the grand greeting: Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh (Peace be with you and so may the mercy of Allah and His blessings). The greeting is recommended to be only used between Muslims. In reply to this a person may repeat the greeting and say: Assalamu Alaikum; however, it is more fitting to reply:</span><a href="http://www.islamic-dictionary.com/index.php?word=wa+alaikum+assalam"><span class="font1"> Wa Alaikum</span></a><span class="font1"> </span><a href="http://www.islamic-dictionary.com/index.php?word=wa+alaikum+assalam"><span class="font1">Assalam.</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font1">The analysis of deictic markers distribution are only focused on the four types of deixis, person deixis, time deixis, place deixis and discourse</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">deixis. The analysis is only focused on those four types of deixis because those elements have their own specific markers that have been grammaticalized and lexicalized.

<p><span class="font1">Based on the analysis and discussion, there are two conclusion for each of the problems. First, the types of deixis in the novel that can be found are person deixis, time deixis, place deixis, discourse deixis and social deixis. Deictic markers marked each type of deixis. The encoding of the role of participants is generally indicated by pronoun establishing relation by anaphoric and chataphoric ways, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">I, we, they, and you.</span><span class="font1"> Time deixis in the novel used deictic element for encoding time such as: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">last, next, today, now, then.</span><span class="font1"> Place deixis in the novel mostly used locative place adverbs such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">here</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">there.</span><span class="font1"> The deictic elements of discourse deixis also were found in the novel </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow Troops</span><span class="font1"> such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">this, these, that, those, and it.</span><span class="font1"> For social deixis, this novel used some terms for encoding the relationship status such as: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guru, ‘Assalamu’-alaikum, Societic,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chiong Si Ku.</span><span class="font1"> Second, Based on the percentages, the dominance of deictic markers in the novel </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow Troops</span><span class="font1"> is the deictic markers of person because person deixis strongly influenced by the dominance that the speaker (first person) exerted over the text in the novel.
