<p><span class="font4">Phosphatase in the soil was found as extracellular enzymes produced by soil microorganisms both in acidic or alkaline conditions. Phosphatase is an enzyme complex that plays an important role in deciding soil-bound phosphate bond organic compounds to form orthophosphate which is available to the plant. Mineralization of organic forms into a inorganic-P determined by the ability of these bacteria to produce phosphatase. Therefore, observations of phosphatase activities are important to know how intensely P mineralization process takes place in the soil. Phosphate solubilizing rhizobacteria (PSR) has been widely known to affect mobilization of insoluble inorganic phosphates become available to plants. Although phosphate solubilizing rhizobacteria is widely available in the soil, their activity is usually not strong enough to compete with other bacteria commonly located in the root zone (rhizosphere). That is why, screening of phosphatase enzyme activity and various phosphate solubilizing ability to obtain better strains of bacteria are still needed. This study was conducted to determine the ability of phosphate solubilizing rhizobacteria, its potential as a biofertilizer inoculant and characterize its capacity to dissolve P-insoluble inorganic and produce phosphatase enzymes in the growing medium. Potential phosphate solubilizing rhizobacteria was tested for their ability in vitro using Pikovskaya media containing insoluble forms of inorganic phosphate as a source P. The results of this study indicate that there are some isolates phosphate solubilizing rhizobacteria that are capable of dissolving the insoluble inorganic-P with different abilities. The highest potential successively displayed by isolates TbPP-4.1; BdPP-2.1; and SBPP-1.3 that significantly has the same ability to soluble inorganic phosphate in the soil. The isolates BdPP-2.1 and TbPP-4.1 are significantly higher than the other isolates for producing phosphatase. Both isolates TbPP-4.1 and BdPP-2.1 have the same pontenty as a biofertilizer based on its capacity to mineralize forms of soil organic phosphorus by phosphatase activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Phosphorus is the second most essential nutrient for plants, after nitrogen and is a source of non-renewable nutrient lately received</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">much attention. Average total phosphorus in soil range from 0.05% (w / w), but only 0.1% can be utilized by plant (Zhu et al., 2011). Most of inorganic phosphorus available were</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">given to the soil through chemical fertilizers, quickly will be bound by the soil immediately after application and become unavailable to the plants. This means that the soil will contain a lot of phosphorus reserves, but availability is low due to low diffusion process and the high power to phosphorus soil fixation. As reported by Islam et al. (2006) that the availability of phosphorus in the soil is usually low both at low pH values and high pH under the conditions of the highlands. Its means that phosphorus could be a major limiting factor for plant growth. Therefore, giving back P in the forms of soil phosphorus bound and insoluble become an important aspect in the effort to increase the availability of phosphorus in the soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Broadly, the soil microorganisms involved in many biological processes includes transformation of soil phosphorus. Phosphate Solubilizing Rhizobacteria (PSR) has been able to mobilize / solubilize phosphate-inorganic insoluble becomes phosphorus available to plants. They are effectively reportedly capable of releasing phosphorus from organic forms and inorganic in the soil through the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">process of mineralization and solubilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the rhizosphere, some bacteria will move insoluble phosphate to produce organic acids to solubilize forms P-inorganic and produce phosphatase enzymes to mineralize forms of soil P-organics. Phosphatase will catalyze the hydrolysis reaction from organic-phosphomonoester become P-inorganic usable for plants. However, the dissolution process P is a complex phenomenon and a lot depends on environmental factors, such as soil nutrient, climate, physiology and growth conditions in the growing medium used. PSR plays an important role in nutrient of plants through increased availability of soil P to plants, and highly prospective use them as biofertilizers for agricultural crops in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite the presence of phosphate solubilizing rhizobacteria (PSR) are mostly in the rhizosphere of plants, their activities are often not strong enough to compete with most other bacteria that already exist in the soil (Jain et al., 2012). The ability to produce organic acids in the process of solubilization P and phosphatase activity of PSR is one determinant of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the quality of isolates PSR as a biofertilizer. Therefore, the selection ability of dissolving P-inorganic soil and phosphatase enzyme activity to mineralize soil P-organics are still needed in order to obtain an effective strain isolates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pancasari village is located at Bedugul region that is one of agriculture farms to supporting horticultural products in Bali. Its have the volcanic soils with intensively agricultural activities. In their agricultural practices, P is supplied to plants through synthetic phosphatic fertilizers, which indeed is expensive and environment disruptive. The use of phosphate solubilizing rhozobacteria as an alternative to chemically synthesized phosphatic fertilizer is therefore an urgent requirement in crop production system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The purpose of this study is screening PSR potential as a biofertilizer and measure its ability to dissolve P and produce phosphatase on in vitro condition.</span></p>

The PSR strains exhibit organic P mineralizing abilities ranging between 0.73-11,039 µg PNP mL<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> , but Tao et al.(2008) reported that an organic P mineralizing abilities ranging between 8–18 µg P mL<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> . The differences are possible because of the ability to produce phosphatase is highly dependent on the type isolates PSR, biomass, energy source and growth condition in the composition of the media (Nautiyal, 1999; Khan et al., 2014). Observations phosphatase in relation to the availability of carbon, nitrogen and soil acidity levels showed a positive correlation as the result of research carried out by Kramer and</span></p>
