<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background</span></h2></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In this age, technology makes anything easier to do. Human beings are always trying to find new things to facilitate human activities. This situation eventually promoted the rapid development of technology. Technological progress can provide many benefits in various societies, especially in the area of information technology that affects consumer behavior. One of the examples of fast-growing technology is e-commerce or online commerce. According to McLeod of Maulana, Susilo, Riyadi, and others (2015), e-commerce is or can be called e-commerce, which is a communication network and computer used to execute business processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The benefits of e-commerce are; easy purchase and sales activities, easy communication with consumers and producers, access to a wider range of target markets, easier and faster dissemination of information, and simplify and speed up the payment process. Another thing that can make e-commerce a bright future for entrepreneurs is the growing number of Internet users, especially in Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tokopedia is the third-largest e-commerce brand, but Tokopedia is declining year by year. Tokopedia is an online shopping or e-commerce venue that allows everyone and business owners in Indonesia to open and manage their online store. To maximize business opportunities, that is, launch products and services to attract the interest of many consumers, companies must promote their sales. According to Priansa (2017: 12), promotion not only talks about the price and distribution of the product but also communicates with the public to understand the product and then buy it. Through promotion, companies can show products to buyers. One form of promotion that companies can conduct is advertising. According to Fandy Tjiptono (2019), advertising is a sample of all forms of creativity and products sponsored by well-known sponsors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tokopedia appointed the Korean celebrity BTS as its brand ambassador in October 2019. The cost of making BTS a brand ambassador within one year is 4 billion won or equivalent to 48.4 billion rupiahs. According to the ecommerce advertising expenditure data shared by the advertising tracking research &quot;Adstensity&quot;, from the perspective of the total e-commerce in this category, Tokopedia ranks fifth with a total advertising expenditure of 336.08 billion rupiahs, and Tokopedia ranks third. In e-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">commerce, advertising expenditures account for 34% of total advertising expenditures and are used for brand ambassadors. According to Purwaningwulan et al. (2018), one of the most commonly used digital marketing techniques is to use celebrities or celebrities as product brand ambassadors. The process and creativity of promoting content make it hopeful to provide different methods. In terms of its role, a brand ambassador is a symbol or brand that represents the needs of potential consumers. You should consider using brand ambassadors, including selecting celebrities who are on the rise, have good images, and have been selected. According to Royan in Nurvita (2017), it can represent product characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">According to Purwaningwulan et al. (2018), a brand ambassador is a person who can represent a product or a company and can talk about the product it represents, so it is expected to have a significant impact on purchase intention. Kotler and Keller (2016) believe that purchase intention is consumer behavior, that is, consumers' desire to buy or choose products based on choice, use, consumption, and even the desired experience. BTS has advantages and disadvantages as a Tokopedia brand ambassador. For example, when BTS became a Tokopedia brand ambassador, there were many negative comments on BTS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In other words, according to CNN's report, it is said that the BTS advertisement on Tokopedia contains LGBT elements reported by the Indonesian National Defense Strategy Institute (LAKSI), and several people requested that the advertisement be removed from Tokopedia together with BTS. Indonesian netizens who disagree with Tokopedia's use of BTS as a brand ambassador made a lot of mockery on various social media. Create a BTS account with hate-themed content on social media.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on i-price, in the fourth quarter of 2018, Tokopedia took the first position or led in this category, with a total of 168 million visitors. However, in the 2nd quarter of 2019 Tokopedia experienced a decrease with a total of 140.4 million visitors and continued to decline until the 4th quarter of 2019 with a total of 67 million visitors, then in the 2nd quarter of 2020 Tokopedia experienced an increase with a total of 86 million visitors, although it increased but not increased significantly and still cannot raise the number of web visitors again as in 2018, in the 3rd quarter of 2020 Tokopedia experienced a decline with a total of 84 million visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Seeing the decline in online visitors on Tokopedia, and Tokopedia having to spend a lot of money to make BTS a brand ambassador, Tokopedia also has a large advertising budget, and Tokopedia ranks third in the e-commerce category. This shows that there is a gap between expectations and reality. In the case of Tokopedia that uses a brand ambassador, the number of Tokopedia's online visitors must be increased, which is one of the factors that influence consumer buying behavior at Tokopedia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That's also because Tokopedia hopes that BTS can become the spokesperson for the brand. In addition to introducing Tokopedia to the public.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">According to Fandy Tjiptono (2019: 47), consumer behavior is a series of activities carried out by consumers to find solutions to their needs and desires. The series of activities include various psychological processes, such as thoughts, feelings, and behavior.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">III.</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESEARCH </span><span class="font2">M</span><span class="font1">ETHOD</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The type of research that researchers do is descriptive quantitative correlation research. According to Sugiono (2015: 192), Descriptive quantitative research is used a correlational approach. Descriptive quantitative is a study used to analyze data by describing or describing the data that has been collected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When measuring the operational variables in this study, the scale of the tool used is the Likert scale. According to Sugiyono (2017: 93), the Likert scale is used to measure the attitudes, opinions, and opinions of a person or a group of people about a specific object or phenomenon that is occurring, and the object or phenomenon is clearly defined an investigation variable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With a Likert scale, the variables to be measured are explained as indicator variables. Then the variable indicator is used as a starting point for compiling instrument items which can be in the form of statements. Each statement item has five answers with a value of 1 to 5 where the value of 1 strongly disagrees and the highest value is 5 is strongly agree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The sampling technique used in this study is nonprobability sampling with intentional sampling. According to Sugiyono (2015: 122), the concept of non-probabilistic sampling technique is a sampling technique that does not provide an equal chance or chance for every element or every member of the population to be selected as a respondent. According to Sugiyono (2015: 124), the definition of intentional sampling is a sampling technique with certain data sources considered. In this study, the people who are considered to know best about what we expect, for example, people who have used the Tokopedia application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this study, considering that the population is unknown because the number of Tokopedia users cannot be known with certainty, and considering the safety of Tokopedia users, the number of Tokopedia users cannot be known with certainty. Therefore, if the population is unknown when determining the number, then Bernoulli's formula can be used. And got the number 96.04 with the smallest sample number, but the author added it to 100 respondents to reduce errors in filling out the questionnaire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Amiyami (2016: 06) suggests that the minimum sample size for a descriptive study is 100 respondents. And according to Sugiyono (2015: 131) explained that the sample size suitable for research is between 30,500 interviewees, so 100 interviewees are included in the standard for investigation. In this study, the primary data used a questionnaire, and the source of the data was obtained from the respondents. where the Questionnaire is a data collection technique that is carried out by giving a set of questions or written statements to respondents to answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this study, the researcher used a questionnaire in which each question was accompanied by five possible answers that the respondent had to choose from. From the answers obtained, then the assessment criteria are arranged</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">for each question item. The scoring criteria for each question item are based on the percentage. The classical assumption test is a test of statistical assumptions that must be met in regression analysis, the aim is to find out whether or not the linear regression model determines whether or not a study is good. This research uses the IBM SPSS Statistics 26 application.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">regression analysis was used to determine the influence of the independent variable (brand ambassador) on the associated variable (purchase intention), which was surveyed on 100 Tokopedia consumers in Bandung City. According to the results of data processing, a simple regression equation model can be formulated as follows, Y = 4.507 + (0.591) X. Based on this equation, it can be described as follows: Constant (a) = 4,507 That is, if the brand ambassador value is 0, the buying interest is 4,507. The regression coefficient value of the brand variable brand ambassador (X) is negative, that is, (0.591). This means that for every additional unit, buying interest will decrease (0.591).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Therefore, it can be concluded that the brand ambassador (X) has a significant negative impact on buying interest (Y). According to the result of the calculation of the formula of the determination coefficient, it can be observed that the influence of the independent variable brand ambassador on the purchase intention of the dependent variable is 30.8% and the remaining 69.2% is affected by other factors. For example, this study did not verify the discount factors or discounts provided by Tokopedia.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Based on the results of the research and discussion on the influence of brand ambassadors on purchase intention in the previous chapter, several conclusions can be drawn. The researchers hope to answer the questions posed in this study. The following are the conclusions:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumer response or the description of the brand ambassador BTS (Bangtan Senyeondan) refers to the results of the descriptive analysis. According to the response of the respondents, the brand ambassador variable (X) generally belongs to the undesirable category. However, in terms of branding Among the 12 Ambassador Variables statements, the statement with the lowest score is &quot;BTS can persuade me to buy online at Tokopedia.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumer's reaction or description of purchase intention. According to the results of descriptive analysis, the variable (Y) of purchase intention based on the respondent's response is usually included in the &quot;fairly good&quot; category. Among the six statements about buying interest variables, although still in the &quot;good enough&quot; category, the lowest-scoring statement is &quot;I plan to buy online on Tokopedia after seeing an advertisement about Tokopedia.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The influence of brand ambassador BTS (Bangtan Seyeondan) on purchase intention refers to the results of the hypothesis test (t-test). The variable brand ambassador (X) has a significant negative impact on purchase interest (Y). and according to the result of the calculation of the formula of the determination coefficient, it can be observed that the influence of the independent variable brand ambassador on the purchase intention of the dependent variable is 30.8%</span></p></li></ul>
