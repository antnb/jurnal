<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The system of linguistics has sounds, structure and meaning and rules to unify everything that is taught unconsciously without realizing that the rules are being studied (Fromkin et all 2011: 13). In linguistic, to study about meaning is part of semantic. Semantic is the branch of micro linguistic. As part of branch linguistic, many general theories of linguistics involves a level of semantic, in addition to cognitive structure (Cruse, 2000). Semantic is the study of the symbols that connect words and we can interpret those sentences so that people can easily interpret words differently and extract unique meanings</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">from those words (Culler, 2005: 55). As closely to semantic there is semiotic which unique to analyze and create the meaning. The semiotic system is understood as a code, a set of rules for connecting signs and meanings (Jewitt, 2012). A sign occurs a symbol whose unusual meaning or capacity to characterize who it symbolizes only in the fact of habit, disposition or another effective general rule that can be analized as such (Chandler, 2007). A sign can be found in many certain media such a poster, song, movie. One of them that most have sign to deliver the meaning is the poster. The meanings we assign to images are related to certain cultural</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">associations, although it should be noted that culture cannot completely determine our responses (Potts, 1996: 31).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Poster is a product that needs a picture for distributing content to the public in the form of a content, product, and brand to attract the attention of those who read or see a poster. According to (Pucacicua, 2014) a poster is a message consisting of an image and displayed in a public place. The poster contains clear information, creating it simpler for the reader to comprehend what the poster expects to convey. The poster is combined with words, design elements and colors to provide better information to the viewer (Anitah, 2008: 12). Thus, it allows us to draw the verbal and visual meaning of signs on the poster. Based on (Dyer, 1982) it can be a verbal sign that appears to be text, words, or sentences in a poster or film. Meanwhile, (Wierzbucka, 1996), in non-verbal signs include images and color choice, which is interesting depending on the reader's culture in written poster. According to (Dyer, 1982) visual and verbal images evoke a sense of status associated with the elegance, luxury, and public appearance of these things. When analyze an image from poster, it is not about what is in the image, but what the image looks like. In this case, several Walt Disney posters are chosen to be analyzed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this study focus on analyzing the verbal and non-verbal signs and the meaning of verbal and non-verbal signs in selected Disney posters found on pinterest with selected types in verbal sign of Disney posters. The disney poster publish about picture or product of film to attract people and contains the written text related to film. In analzying this research is to make the readers know about sign that have meaning with the verbal and non-verbal signs. Thus, it is challenging to analyze the use of sign in disney poster. The specific thing that this research focused on 1) to find out verbal</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and non-verbal signs in Disney posters and 2) to find out the meaning of verbal and non-verbal signs in disney posters. After analyzing this study to avoid confusion in the public in understanding the meaning, this study can give viewers a better understanding of that elements succesfuly to the viewers.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>METHOD AND THEORY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The data in this research was taken from pinterest application. There are three data used in this research which the data that selected were downloaded from the disney picture to get unique verbal and non-verbal signs. In the process of collecting the data. The observation method was used to obtain certain information from the data and often involves the researcher performing a range of roles and using various techniques, to collect the data (Baker, 2006). Thus, it is started with select the specificity of the verbal and non-verbal signs from the pinterest, download to identify the poster, reading and classifying the verbal and non-verbal signs, finding the meaning from verbal and non-verbal signs. In this analysis the data described academically. Thus, the researcher used descriptive qualitative method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many similar study about semiotics analysis especially in poster. The study about analyze the verbal and non-verbal signs in the poster and the meaning of each sign. As the first same analysis by Pratiwi et all (2021), she analyzed the meaning of verbal and nonverbal signs of the posters. In previous study about verbal and non-verbal signs, it helps this current study to provide a clearer explanation for analyzing verbal and non-verbal signs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The second study to review is by Prawiranatha (2018). This previous study explains the meaning and function of verbal and visual signs and how they are</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">related. The previous study helps the current study about analyzing meaning of verbal and non-verbal signs. Meanwhile, this current study more support in the discussion of colors in the data that has been analyzed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The third study under review is by Devi et all (2017). This study identified the types of verbal and non-verbal signs found on Zootopia movie poster and explain the meaning of these verbal and non-verbal signs. This previous study only focused on analyzing the meaning of verbal and non-verbal signs while the current study discussed the verbal and non-verbal found, meaning, and colors used in the verbal and non-verbal signs. Thus, the discussion of the current study more supportive for the previous study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fourth study to review is by Nugraha et all (2019). This previous study identified and to find out message verbal and visual signs. This study also analyzed the relation between verbal and visual signs. Comparing to the current study, there is analyze about colors meaning while the previous study is not discussed it. Thus, the current study can support the previous study because it have a new disccusion about meaning to make the reader better understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fifth study to review is by Widiarta et all (2021). This previous study have the same analysis to the current study about to find verbal and non-verbal signs and analyze the meaning of verbal and non-verbal signs. Both of this study is related about discussion but the theory that used to discussed about meaning of the data is different.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many types of research to analyze this study. The research analyzes the meaning from each verbal and nonverbal sign of the posters. There are relations of signifier and signified in the verbal and non-verbal sign to support the poster. A sign is anything that can be considered as an important substitute for</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">something else (Eco, 1979: 3). This study were complete the analyze by denotation and connotation meaning. As stated by (Barthes, 1998) signs consist of denotative and connotative meanings. Therefore, this analysis used color meaning to know what is hidden meaning in non-verbal sign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are several theories in this research:</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Semiotics Theory from Saussure in Chandler (2007)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Saussure devides the sign into ‘signifier’ and signified’. The connection between the signifier and signified is named “meaning” symbolized in the Saussurean diagram by arrows. There is a an example of linguistic about shop doorway, a sign consisting of:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">•</span><span class="font4"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words ‘open’ implies signifier</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">•</span><span class="font4"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The store is available for business. It means signified.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Thus, a sign should have a signifier and signify. It can not be able completely irrelevant signifier or a shapeless signified.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Theory of Denotation and Connotation from Barthes (1977)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Barthes in the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Elements of Semiology</span><span class="font4"> expand the idea including denotation and connotation meaning. Barthes explains that each system of significations consists of an expression (E) and a content field (C) and that the signification overlaps with the connection (R) of two planes: ERC. Therefore, the first system (ERC) becomes the signifier, from the second system. The first system is denotation and the second system (wider than the first) is a connotation. Connotation of signifier which call connotators, consist of a sign system (integrated signifier and signified) of a denoted system. Certainly, several denoted signs can be grouped together to form a connotator, provided the latter has a common signified of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">connotation. In oher words, the units of the connoted system do not neccesarily have the same as the system denoted size.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Theory Meaning of Color Terms by Cerrato (2012)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Cerrato (2012: 4) states that different colors emit different wavelengths, and this different frequencies have different effect on us. In Cerrato, color has many different meaning, such as:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red color</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Cerrato says red is a positive and warm color. In psychology, red means energy, passion action, power, and pleasure.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orange color</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Orange seen as a very warm color, it gives a special sensation to the human &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eye. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orange &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">physiologically, means refreshing, stimulating, and creates enthusiasm only if too many oranges can be considered cheap.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow color</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">It stands in the color of sunlight. This color is related to pleasure, satisfaction, and stability.</span></p>
