<p><span class="font0">BACKGROUND</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Bali as one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, has had a huge impact on the existence of its culture and local wisdom. Bali has many noble cultural works, one of which is the traditional woven fabric in the form of cepuk woven fabric which is the work of the people in Tanglad Village, Nusa Penida, Klungkung Regency. In the current era, the development of tourism and a very broad free market has eliminated the existence of cepuk woven fabrics in an era of very tight and fast competition. The manufacture of this cepuk woven cloth takes quite a long time and is complicated so that the production price is quite expensive. The high selling price of this cepuk woven fabric</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">E-Journal of Cultural Studies DOAJ Indexed (Since 14 Sep 2015) </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">ISSN 2338-2449 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/"><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font0">has made him lose in the tight and fast market competition. In addition, the emergence of artificial cepuk woven fabrics made with modern machines with a much cheaper selling value has made cepuk woven fabrics even worse. This has led to a decrease in the number of cepuk woven craftsmen which has an impact on the existence of cepuk woven fabrics in Nusa Penida in particular and Bali in general. The existence of cepuk woven fabrics as ancestral cultural heritage in the Nusa Penida area, Klungkung, Bali faces a complicated problem, amid its great potential to introduce woven fabrics typical of Nusa Penida, Klungkung Regency, various very specific woven fabrics (Telagawathi, 2017: 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The development of globalization today brings two impacts on the socio-cultural life of the Balinese people. Broadly speaking, globalization has changed the mindset of people who were previously traditional and eventually developed into a modern society. Globalization has also changed the pattern of life of the people of Nusa Penida, one of which is guiding people to get to know various cultures from foreign countries. This new culture dominates and is very influential at the surface structure level , namely the attitudes and behavior patterns of the people in Nusa Penida. This forms a consumptive lifestyle, hedonism, individualistic attitudes, and creates social inequality (Nurhaidah and Musa, 2015: 1). This global lifestyle greatly affects the lives of Balinese people, especially people in Nusa Penida which is a tourist destination. The people of Nusa Penida are more comfortable wearing clothes that have western nuances rather than using traditional fabrics as their identity and lifestyle. It seems that this has shifted the functions of traditional cloth in Nusa Penida such as the cepuk woven cloth in Tanglad Village, Nusa Penida which is quite rich in religious, customary and socio-cultural functions in the community in Nusa Penida. Therefore, there is a need for an effort to save the function of the woven fabric for the sustainability and local wisdom of the people in Nusa Penida.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The symptom experienced by the people of Nusa Penida now is a very basic social change of culture . The acceleration of information in the wave of globalization has brought significant changes to the people of Nusa Penida, especially in the deep structure (value system, world view, philosophy and belief). Changes occur due to cultural contact between countries which is interpreted as a dialectic of new values with old values that hegemony and dominate each other, which allows homogenization and neoliberalization in all aspects of life including local cultural values that have been the grip of the people in Nusa Penida. This condition gives rise to spit and uncertainty about values because the people of Nusa Penida glorify modern values by marginalizing transcendental values . As a result, there are various forms of deviation from moral values which are reflected in the patterns, styles, and patterns of people's lives (Suwardani, 2015: 248). This negative</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/"><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">https://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/ecs/</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font0">impact affects one of the local wisdom values that exist in the value of cepuk woven fabrics in the community in Tanglad Village, Nusa Penida, namely the value degradation in the use of cepuk woven fabrics with certain patterns which were initially only used as special fabrics as ceremonial fabrics but freely used at this time. Therefore, it is necessary to have a new order that regulates the regulation of the use of local wisdom values for the community so that they do not become increasingly degraded. Therefore, the Indonesian government through Law no. 5 of 2017 concerning the Advancement of Culture, especially in Article 4, it is emphasized that the promotion of culture is based on tolerance, diversity, locality, cross-regional, participatory, beneficial, sustainable, freedom of expression, integration, equality and mutual cooperation. With the aim of developing the noble values of the nation's culture, enriching cultural diversity, strengthening national identity, strengthening national unity and integrity, educating the nation's life, improving the nation's image, realizing civil society, improving people's welfare, preserving the nation's cultural heritage, and influencing the direction of the nation's cultural heritage. the development of world civilization, so that culture becomes the direction of national development (UU RI No. 5 of 2017 concerning the Advancement of Culture). Based on this, it raises the urgency to conduct studies as well as document, inventory, and protect Balinese weaving, especially the cepuk woven fabric in Tanglad Village, Nusa Penida as a valuable cultural asset.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This study will focus on the Tanglad Village area, Nusa Penida sub-district, Klungkung Regency, Bali Province, because this village is the center or center for craftsmen who are still surviving by making various patterns and motifs of cepuk woven fabrics in Nusa Penida.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">HISTORY OF TANGLAD VILLAGE, NUSA PENIDA</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One day after the Kuningan holiday there was a group sailing for a cruise. The group came from Ketewal Village, Gianyar Regency Level II . Arriving in the middle of the ocean, the group was unwittingly dragged by a strong current accompanied by a large wave. as well as suddenly a strong wind came that swept the group away until they were stranded on a steep cliff to the south of Nusa Penida Island. It was on the cliff that the group set foot in search of protection. Because the boat they were riding in suffered heavy damage, with determination and strong will, one of the group managed to climb the steep cliff in various ways to help his comrade who was still at the bottom, finally the group was able to climb up. survived even in very poor conditions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">To return to continue the journey in a very poor condition with dungkah (steps) that wraps, the place is named DRevelation. In this place, the group stayed for some time and some even started farming. At a certain time, the eldest leader in the group gave an order to one of the group members. The one who was ordered was I Bekung. Because I Bekung was still a child and the orders he received seemed like coercion, he felt annoyed. With annoyance in his heart, I Bekung left the group, which was followed by his younger brother, Ni Wulang Singah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After a long walk towards the east, the two children felt tired and took a break to look for food. In search of fruit he met a large tree named Bihingin and the place was named Bihingin. And so on, he met another big tree which was named the Gepah/Gepuh Tree, as well as the place was named Gepuh. After living in Gepuh for some time, I Bekung and Ni Wulang Singa continued their journey to the south, where they met a complete spice plant, which in Balinese is called Carub (complete), hence the name Caruban. After passing through Caruban they met again with various difficulties and finally they fell ill. Because of the pain they seemed to be crippled (can't go anywhere) so the place was named Penaancang.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After recovering they continued their journey to the south and finally met with a very dense forest, this is where the intention of Ni Wulang the Lion arose to do penance meditation. In doing meditation in Ni Wulang, the lion received a gift (word) so that they could continue their journey to the east. On their way to the east they met a high cliff. Because Ni Wulang Singa was abandoned by his brother, he called his brother: anti...anti....anti.. .(Continuing the journey to the west the steps became uncertain which in Balinese sayar-soyor with that this place was named Soyor Because Ni Wulang the lion felt that he had not gotten what he wanted, he continued to do meditation meditation which finally got the following words: &quot;O MY SON ACTUALLY YOUR JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH IS WRONG, THE BIG TREE IS ON THE EAST.&quot; relieved they continued their journey by finding various kinds of oddities and then met with a steep cliff, this is where he thought after a long journey from the west to the east end which according to his mind was the boundary of the area then the place was named Watas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After leaving their dead, they continued their journey towards the north, they quickly decided that the area was suitable for agriculture and they intended to settle there. because he was quick to make a decision, the place was named Julingan which comes from the word Iju and the word Ling. the word Iju which means fast and the word Ling which means intent or purpose. after settling in julingan, they remembered the old incident when they separated from their neighbors who used to be where they live now, that's why</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">they named the place Tangga Lad which means former neighbour, over time the pronunciation becomes TANGLAD. This is where I Bekung and Ni Wulang the lion settled and eventually mate to produce offspring until now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Balinese woven fabrics are well known throughout Indonesia and even abroad, each district has a unique and distinctive fabric motif, such as that found in Tanglad Village, Nusa Penida District, Klungkung Regency. This typical woven cloth of Tanglad Village is named &quot;&nbsp;Cepuk Woven Fabric &quot;&nbsp;. Cepuk woven cloth is a typical craft of Tanglad Village, which comes from ancestors and is passed down from generation to generation. Until now, we can still find Cepuk woven fabrics in Tanglad Village, Karang Gede Village, and several villages in Nusa Penida.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF CEPUK WOVEN FABRICS IN TANGLAD VILLAGE, NUSA PENIDA</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The origin of the name Cepuk Weaving cloth itself comes from Sanskrit, namely 'Cepuk' which means Canging Wood. Canging wood is a type of plant that is suitable for use as a basic material for making woven fabrics. Based on this history, the name Cepuk Weaving became the brand of the typical woven fabric of Tanglad Village. The existence of the Cepuk woven cloth is not only used when carrying out prayers, but this cloth is also used in certain religious ceremonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are several types of Cepuk Woven Fabrics, and each type has different uses in religious ceremonies, as follows: Cepuk Ngawis , woven cloth used during the pitra yadnya (ngaben) ceremony. Cepuk Tangi Gede , a woven cloth worn by the middle child whose all brothers and sisters died (cremation ceremony). Cepuk Kurung , is a Cepuk cloth that can be used in ordinary days. At first this type of Cepuk Tenun was used not as outer clothing, but as 'tapih', which is a cloth that is used as the innermost layer before using outer clothing. It is very interesting considering that now the Cepuk Weaving fabric is very popular with good quality and at a price that is quite affordable for the wider community as fans or collectors of typical Nusa Penida fabrics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The development of the era also affects the level of equipment used in making Cepuk woven fabrics. In the past, people still used a simple loom called the Cegcegan Board . The Cegcegan board is named because it uses two planks in the form of a block with a hole at the top as a place to put the thread to make the cepuk weave. The sound of the board when it is kicked at the time of tightening the threads so that the threads are one with the other. At this time the Cepuk weaving equipment has begun to develop, its size is also larger than the old weaving. The rate of speed in completing a sheet of loom,</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">is better than traditional semi looms. Old tools take five days, while Semi Traditional tools only take one day. With the size of a sheet of kamen 200 x160 cm. In terms of quality, the traditional and semi-traditional tools are the same, according to the ability of the weaver.

The synthetic cepuk woven fabric is dyed from chemicals that can be purchased in the market and this is very different from the natural cepuk woven fabric because the dyes all use natural basic ingredients from various types of plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The prices for these two types of Cepuk woven fabrics are different. Natural types reach the price of four million rupiahs per sheet, while chemical types are currently still in the range of five hundred thousand rupiahs (could be more or less).
