Abstract Classification is the process of differentiating a set of models into several data classes There are many methods that can be used for the classification process one of which is the Artificial Neural Network method Neural networks are a computational method that mimics biological syafar networks Artificial condition networks can be used to model complex relationships between input and output to recognize patterns in data 1 In this study testing was
