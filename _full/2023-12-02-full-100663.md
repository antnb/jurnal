Background Decompression sickness DCS is a condition where bubbles form in the blood from dissolved gasses usually nitrogen which cause tissue and blood vessel injury due to a decrease in environmental pressure One of the factors that can increase the incidence of DCS is the presence of patent foramen ovale PFO in divers Method This literature review is a study systematic review the type used is the original article obtained through the database PubMed a
