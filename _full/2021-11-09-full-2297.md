Until now research by using of a standard cutting tool at lathe process is still become a subject of many studies in order to reduce of the force cutting power and temperature However there are no satisfactory results yet as expected In order to participate in overcoming these problems it is conducted a study on the cutting process by using of standard cutting tool which is modified become doubleedged chisel cutting tool Variables selected in the machining
