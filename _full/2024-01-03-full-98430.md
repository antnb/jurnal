<p><span class="font6">Halliday develop the interpersonal function into a new system called the appraisal system which has a function as a parameter in writing. The text of Babad Dipanegara has many positive and negative elements in its writing which need to be examined using an appraisal system especially in the attitudes aspect to convey the message and the purpose of the writing. The data were obtained from the text Babad Dipanegara and qualitative methods were used to examine the attitudes in the text. This research concluded that the attitudes found in the text can be classified into three forms namely affect, judgment, and appreciation.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Each text has different characteristics seen from a linguistic point of view, so it contains different social facts. Analyzing a text generally includes discussing a lexical phrase, clause, or paragraph in the context of the text where each of these parts has its function and position Halliday (1985). On the other hand, the text also functions to reconstruct someone’s beliefs or paradigms that can be disseminated. According to Halliday &amp;&nbsp;Hasan (1976) which states that text is a functioning language or it can be said that language can carry out certain tasks in a context. Text analysis is not only done on linguistic texts but can be done on other texts, such as literary texts, both factual and fictional texts (Martin, 2000). Researching a text requires reasoning about the various elements contained in the text so analyzing text with a single concept or point of view will not be able to provide maximum results (Halliday, 1978).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The text of Babad Dipanegara is an autobiographical text which contains the life history of Prince Dipanegara who is known as a national hero. This chronicle was written in 1831-1832 by Prince Dipanegara himself while in exile. This text received an award from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Culture Organization (UNESCO) as a memory of the world in 2013. The text contains examples of the courage and unyielding attitude of Prince Dipanegara during his lifetime which is certainly worthy of admiration and imitation. However, it is very unfortunate that the existing phenomenon is that this text is not widely known by the younger generation or even the wider community. This text contains many moral messages and heroic values which of course can be used as a reflection of the attitude of the younger generation. The fact is that this cannot be done because the existence of the Babad Dipanegara is not widely known so the messages and values contained cannot be passed on from generation to generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This raises several questions related to whether the language used by the author is not easy for readers to understand or less attractive because too many elements dominate either positive or negative elements, so an evaluation needs to be carried out using an appraisal study. Previous research has been done by Arunsirot (2012) who talked about the use of appraisal in Thai Newspaper and Afzal, N. &amp;&nbsp;Harun (2015) about the analysis of newspaper critically by using appraisal system. Both of those research uses positive sentence to express or deliver the messages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Appraisal is concerned to convey someone’s emotions or opinions so it can be seen from hoe the writers align their authorial and lead to how they manipulate their writings to convey the purposes of writing (Hood, 2010). Appraisal theory can be used to study a text to determine the interpersonal relationship between the writer and the reader because this theory can explore the attitudes used in the text. Appraisal theory sees a deficiency in interpersonal analysis in Systemic Functional Linguistics (Eggins, 2004). SFL discusses the distribution of mood and residue of a text, so this study was developed by Martin &amp;&nbsp;White (2005) by dividing the appraisal systems into three subsystems, namely attitude, engagement, and graduation to see the personal relationship and socially constructed through language. Attitude is how a person expresses a situation, engagement is the source of the attitude and graduation is how the attitude is applied. The appraisal system is divided into subsystems so that it is possible to use it to find out the attitude negotiated in the text of Babad Dipanegara. According to Martin &amp;&nbsp;Rose (2003 : 6), the appraisal systems refer to assessments related to evaluation, the attitudes that appear in the text, the forms of emotions, feelings involved, and the resulting values according to the circumstances of the reader. Attitudes are related to the evaluation of things, the character of people, and feelings. Attitudes refer to phrases used in the text and can be seen from the use of adjectives and adverbs to see the author’s evaluative attitude which aims to lead the reader’s point of view and opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Attitudes are divided into three types namely; affect, judgment, and appreciation. 1) Affect refers to the feeling which are emotional reactions in the text raised by the writer so that the reader can understand them. Emotional reactions related to judgment, both in negative and positive forms related to someone’s feelings towards something discussed. Affect can be expressed through verbs related to mental processes, such as loving, hating, liking, or loving. Besides being marked as a verb characterized by mental processes, affect can be expressed with adverbs (especially adverbs of manner). Affect can also be expressed through adjectives related to emotions. As an evaluation based on feelings, affect generally can be categorized into positive and negative but in detail, it consists of un/happiness, in/security, and dis/satisfactions. 2) Judgment is a normative assessment of human behavior related to rules or behavioral conventions which include social sanctions and social esteem. Judgment is related to ethics, religion, morals, legal, rules, and existing positive regulations. Judgment has an assessment that is equivalent to attitudes, but in the form of positive and negative to show the existence of social norms regarding truth and ethics (moral behavior) of the writer in the text towards what is written. 3) Appreciation is the last aspect of attitude with the concept of evaluating objects, attitudes, and everything related to the speaker or writer that can produce reactions and also judgments. As well as affects and judgment, appreciation is also used to assess something positively and negatively. Appreciation sometimes confuses because of its similarity to judgment but there are several things distinguish appreciation from judgment.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">This study aimed to describe the attitudes found in the text Babad Dipanegara using a qualitative descriptive approach. The data were sourced from the text Babad Dipanegara which has been translated into the Indonesian language. The original text was written by the prince Dipanegara itself so it is quite important to find out the interpretation of the society by using Halliday’s theory namely the appraisal system. This theory explains the form and function of the attitudes in the text. Data were obtained by observing the text to reveal the form of attitudes. Searching for the data in this study was assisted by using a data concordance tool called Antconc. Concordance tool helps to find the number of occurrences of a word in the text by determining the keywords to be searched beforehand. Keywords to analyze these attitudes can be found in the theory books. According to Creswell (2009), descriptive qualitative techniques involve notetaking methods so every data is written down in a book note. After the data were classified based on their form, the data were analyzed carefully using the theory proposed by Martin &amp;&nbsp;White (2005).</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Attitudes are related to the evaluation of things, the character of people, and feelings. Attitudes refer to the phrases used in the text and can be seen from the use of adjectives and adverbs to see the author’s evaluative attitude which aims to lead the reader’s point of view and opinion. Attitudes in the appraisal system consist of three simultaneous called affect, judgment, and appreciation. Each of these forms is used in the Babad Dipanegara text as follows;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affect</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Affect can be divided into several parts of a person’s emotional form. Fontaine, et all (2013) in their book entitled components of Emotional Meaning describes several forms of emotion. They can be divided into positive and negative forms. These two categories can be sorted in the form of affect of un/happiness, in/security, and dis/satisfaction.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appreciation</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Appreciation is similar to judgment, but there are several things that distinguish appreciation from judgment. Appreciation is in a positive form, but in appreciation the assessment made of objects, attitudes, and so on does not require a right or wrong criterion. This is because appreciation is an expression of evaluation that cannot be measured because it is relative. If an assessment is made of the same thing, the appreciation expressed by someone can be in the form of a positive appreciation which will not be the same because it is adjusted to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">thoughts of each individual. In the sentence “He is very handsome”, the aspects assessed in the sentence are relative in nature so that they cannot be categorized with true or false criteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The text uses a form of appreciation that describes a positive assessment. Appreciation is given by someone to other people or it can be given to ourselves for something that is done and produces good results. Appreciation is only found in the positive form and cannot be found in the negative form.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">The explanation above shows that in the text Babad Dipanegara, it is found that there are two forms of general emotion that occurs in humans which can be put into writing. These emotions are in the positive and negative form that is contained in a person’s behavior. The attitude of a person is then found to be used in more detail in the form of affect, judgment, and appreciation. Each of those forms is used in the text purely to describe someone’s emotions. The use of positive and negative emotional forms found in the text is used in a balanced way so it can be said that this text is a text that aims to tell the journey of Prince Dipanegara’s life or autobiography without any commercial elements which generally have more positive emotional forms. This text also does not have a dominant negative element which is usually widely used in black campaigns.</span></p>
