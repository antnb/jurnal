The computerdepicted groundwater model is a representation of the actual situation that represents it in the field so that it can function as a monitoring and forecasting of a future groundwater flow system The purpose of this study is to model groundwater flow that can represent the actual conditions that occur in the urban area of Majene Regency The modeling is done numerically using Visual Modflow The input data required are logbor  geoelectric data cor
