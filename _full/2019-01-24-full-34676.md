Lactic acid bacteria LAB is a group of Grampositive bacteria in shape of coccus or bacilli and catalasenegative and also have the ability to produce lactic acid LAB is also a microorganism which is not toxic and has the ability to produce antimicrobial compounds known as bacteriocins This research aimed to find out the physicochemical characteristic and the antimicrobial activities of bacteriocin isolated from isolates 15B originated from the bali cattleco
