<p><span class="font1">Abstrak</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengidentifikasi tipe dan penggunaan bahasa pria dan wanita di dalam sebuah film. Penelitian ini berfokus pada ujaran pemain utama pria dan wanita serta lawan bicaranya. Data diambil dari sebuah film berjudul Camp Rock: Final Jam (2010). Jenis penelitian ini adalah studi pustaka. Data diperoleh melalui teknik menonton dan mencatat. Data yang terkumpul kemudian dianalisis secara kualitatif dan deskriptif. Teori yang digunakan untuk menganalisis adalah teori oleh Deborah Tannen (1990). Hasil menunjukkan bahwa pria cenderung lebih mendominasi pembicaraan di dalam suatu percakapan dan memutuskan suatu hal tanpa melibatkan pihak kedua atau ketiga. Sedangkan wanita cenderung menghabiskan waktunya untuk bergosip atau membicarakan hal-hal yang mengarah pada hubungan dan lebih sering mengekspresikan perasaan mereka daripada pria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kata kunci: Bahasa, gender, pria, wanita</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of the Study</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Lakoff (1973) observes that men use stronger expletives such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">shit</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">damn,</span><span class="font1"> whereas women use weaker or softer profanity such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oh dear, goodness,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judge</span><span class="font1">. In general, studies of forms confirm that men use more nonstandard language than women do. Men talk more about sports, money, business, and politics and women talk more about home and family. Various studies found that women use more emotional language while men focus more on</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">perceptual attributes and destructive action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the ways to study men’s and women’s languages in their communication is by looking at the movie. Movie is the reflection of the real situation in a society, because the directors always rely on the real condition in a society when making a movie. In this study, a movie will be used as representative language, used by both men and women with their respective features. It is one of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">famous Disney movies for their friendship story, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</span><span class="font1">. This movie is very interesting to be taken as the object of this research because this movie shows us that the conversation between men and women can occur well when they talk about similar hobbies and dreams. Furthermore, this study is concerned with the comparison between women and men language used by actors and actresses in the movie </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</span><span class="font1">. On the other hand, how the language featurescharacterise their talk in this movie will be discussed in this study as well.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems of the Study</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">There are two problems in this study as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the types of men’s and women’s language styles used in the movie </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</span><span class="font1">?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How men’s and women’s language styles are distinctively used in the movie </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</span><span class="font1">?</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aims of the Study</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The aims of this study based on problems above are as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To identify and classify the types of men’s and women’s language styles used in the movie </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</span><span class="font1">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To analyze how men’s and women’s language styles are distinctively used in the movie </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</span><span class="font1">.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">There are four aspects of the research method used in this study, namely data source, method and technique of collecting data, method and technique of analyzing data, and method and technique of presenting data analysis.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Source</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">This study used a 2010 Disney Original movie and the sequel to the 2008 film Camp Rock, namely </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</span><span class="font1"> as the data source. The movie is directed by Paul Hoen and starred by the famous singer and boyband, Demi Lovato and Jonas Brothers. The film won the 2011 People’s Choice Award for Favorite Family TV Movie and received 40% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, higher than the previous film (20% rating).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The data were collected using the note taking technique. First, the movie was watched thoroughly and accurately to identifythe dialogues that contain the men and women’s language styles. Second, taking notes of the men’s and women’s language and classifying them intotype based on the men’s and women’s language. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4.3 Method and Technique of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Analyzing Data</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The collected data were qualitatively and descriptively analyzed based on the theory proposed by Deborah Tannen (1990). The data collected from the movie </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</span><span class="font1">was classified according to the six types proposed in the theory. In addition, how the language styles were distinctively used in the movie is also based on the same theory.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding and Discussion</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">There aresix types of men’s and women’s language in this research. Each type was typed in bold and followed by its analysis. The analysis can be presented as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Status vs Support</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Mitchie : I had absolutely the best day ever. Everything's finally starting to work out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shane : &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">That's great. It's all</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">because of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mitchie : No, it's because of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shane : Now that everybody else has gotten your time, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">I think I'm gonna demand some of my own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mitchie : It hasn't been that bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shane : The whole reason I'm here, the reason my brothers are here, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is so I can get to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">know you better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the dialogue between Mitchie and Shane, we can see that Shane wants to have some of Mitchie’s time for him. According to Tannen, men are comfortable telling others what to do and appearing superior (status). Mostly, men want to get straight to the bottom line and choose without consulting. Shane responds</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“That’s great. It’s all because of you,”</span><span class="font1"> which is all Mitchie’s happiness. We can see that he was giving feedback to Mitchie</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">directly and with bluntness by saying fewer words and express fewer feelings. Shane wants to finish one topic from Mitchi’s happiness to another topic that is getting her time for him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independence vs Intimacy</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Nate : &nbsp;So, Dana, you were</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">amazing up there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dana : You think? </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">I'm just glad it's finally over. We've been practicing for weeks, and still, every time I go on, I'm almost sure I'm gonna throw up. I'm really glad you guys came. My dad was totally sure none of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">would show. My dad's Axel Turner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: He's your dad?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dana &nbsp;&nbsp;: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Everybody says that, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kind of exactly like that, but trust me, once you get to know him, he's a really great guy. Well, I guess I should go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nate : Here. You don't wanna lose it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dana : You can keep it if you want.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The conversation above shows</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usually &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">straightforwardly and want the 'bottom line' of their questions or conversations; they speak with little details than women do. When Dana responded to Nate about her performance, she started to tell how</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">she overcame the practice and so on. Meanwhile, women's speech is like doing a story telling. They like to speak with so much details and sometimes becoming frustrated for a man to wait for the bottom line to the story. Dana wants to create feelings of intimacy by conversing with Nate. But, Nate does not use communication in this way, he replied to her with short comments.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advice vs Understanding</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Shane : Because you and I are going on a moonlight picnic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mitchie : Now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shane : Righ now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mitchie : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">How could you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shane : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cause I’m a nice of a guy. </span><span class="font1">Mitchie : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Think I just go running off. </span><span class="font1">Shane : Your saying no.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mitchie : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Do you not understand everything that needs to be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shane : How could I not when you are reminding me every 2 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mitchie : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">And the water balloon fight. What were you thinking?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shane : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">I was thinking wow, wouldn’t it of been fun</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mitchie : So, you’re saying I’m not fun?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shane : Huh, why do I keep trying? The whole reason I came was because &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.....</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mitchie : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">I know, was to get know me better. Well guess what this is me</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trying to save something that I care about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shane : ... So am I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Women and men are often frustrated by the other's way of responding to their expression of troubles. Just as the dialogue above, Shane was trying to help Mitchie take a break from all her problems by taking her to a moonlight picnic. Mitchie had been troubled by her friends’ attitude and she was not comforted by Shane's answer. It upset her more. Not only didn't she hear what she wanted, that he understood her feelings, but, she felt he was asking her to leave her job when she was signaling him how important this jobfor her. Mitchie heard Shane’s suggestion as he didn’t care and wasn’t bothered about the battle between Camp Rock and Camp Star. Mitchie wanted the gift of understanding, but Shane gave her the gift of advice. He was taking the role of problem solver, whereas she simply wanted confirmation for her feelings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dana tried to build a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">conversation with Nate to create</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">intimacy (feeling) between them. Dana asked Nate some questions regarding Nate’s hobby. Danatook longer to communicate with Nate as she often went into depth about feelings. However, Nate just responded with short and simple answers, as the men always did. Dana was simply trying to establish a certain kind of intimacy with him– inviting him to reciprocate and share</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">himself with her. She seeks to have Nate respond as shehas always done, and talk with her about his concerns. Nate, however, hears these conversations as requests for information.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order vs Proposals</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Axel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Hey. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">I don't want you</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">talking to that boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dana : Don't worry. I don't think that its gonna be a problem</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Men tend to use direct imperative to tell their orders. Just as Axel (Dana’s father) told his daughter not totalk with Nate (because he is from Camp Rock while they’re Camp Star). Mostly, men use more direct language when giving orders. With regard to giving orders, men mainly bosses and giving orders to their partner. Men bosses use fewer words when giving orders and tend to be more direct.Men appear to be rash, and they just say what they want to say and seldom care what others think, so men’s speech is usually blunt and solid.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conflict vs Compromise</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Mitchie : Camp Rock is invited to an opening night bonfire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brown : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">No, no, no. Absolutely not. Not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brown : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">This is a set up. For what I'm not sure of</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Connie : Come on Brown. It will be fun. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">You said yourself we need to get along right.</span><span class="font1"> This is not because I haven't had desert yet. This is really good chocolate!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Analysis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The role of peacemaker reflects the general tendency among women to seek agreement. When Connie tells Brownthat the bonfire would be fun and, Brown responds by pointing out that something bad could happend if they come to the bonfire, which the invitation all set up. He knew that his old friend, Axel, planned something by inviting Camp Rock to the bonfire. He perceives that Axel is trying to get him to do something without coming right out and saying so, he feels threatened by the invitation so he refused to come. But Connie compromised him. She didn’t want to create any fights between Camp Rock and Camp Star so she tried to tell Brown to get along with each others.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that while men tend to show more of their status maintenance, for which they did not want to give up. To men, a primary means of establishing status is to tell others what to do, and generally show their dominance way of speaking. Meanwhile, mostly women are comfortable only in the role of giver of help and support. They use conversations to seek and give confirmation and support their idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When men tend to show their independence, on the other hand, women like to create intimacy while having a conversation. Men are working hard to preserve their independence in a hierarchical world. In the previous chapter, it can be seen that Brown (the owner of Camp Star) likes to think and decide something independently. He decided to close the camp without consulting with anyone. The same case also happened when Shane invited Mitchie to have a moonlight picnic without asking her permission. So far, it can be found women see conversation to negotiate closeness and intimacy; talk is the essence of intimacy, they do talking to build up closeness and to get more intimacy with her partner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Beside that, most women think that conversation with her partner is mainly helpful to create intimacy and relationship while for men it is a means to provide information, while remaining independent and maintaining status in a competitive society. The differences between communication styles of men and women are as follows: men are goal-oriented, they define their sense of self through their ability to achieve results. On the other hand, women are relationship-oriented as they define their sense of self by their feelings and by the quality of their relationship.</span></p>
