<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Abstract</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">As a language, English has now spread all over the world and has been known by quite a few people currently. English is known as crucial and salient to learn. The language quite reveals complexities that make some people sometimes give in to continue studying it. It has such as grammar, linguistic terms, and other rules that play a very significant role while applied to daily life. One of the rules that are quite hard to do is combining words within a sentence called as collocation. This paper aims at investigating whether the students at University of Islam Malang have known about collocation. In this study, the researcher conducted a quick survey. The data was collected with an open-questionnaire containing five different sentences in which the students should translate the Indonesian sentence into English correctly using a correct combination of words. The result of the study revealed that the students from University of Islam Malang still have been committing errors in combining words in a sentence; it is due to their little acquaintance with collocation even having no knowledge of it. Since it has happened to the students, by conducting this small research, the researcher expects that the students may learn much more about collocation either from this paper or other resources with regards to collocation learning in English.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>I INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">One of the propositions with which is most frequently dealt by EFL while practicing English is writing. This issue, in fact, not only occurs to the EFL student but happens to the ESL students as well both beginners and advanced students of English. L2 learners, for the most part, assume that writing in English is rather complex. They claim that they do not only have to think about how to arrange the words in a sentence, but also have to consider the grammatical structure and appropriate vocabulary that will be used in the sentence itself. In writing English, a writer not only thinks about how to present an idea in the text but also reckons the language usage he/she uses. Thomas (1988:14) states that usage designates rules of a less basic and binding sort, concerning how we should use the language in certain situation. It is obvious that usage in writing such as words is of great importance to use. It is closely related to how we should utter words well in a sentence. Both EFL/ESL are sometimes confused about how to use some words in the sentence. Thomas (1988:14) also notes that usage establishes the ground rules of writing, circumscribing what you are free to do. It is also clear-cut explanation from him that words become the most important fundamental rule that will bring a good idea in the text. One of the factors which have a profound impact on students’ writing ability is word combination in a sentence called as Collocation. In this case, the writer focuses on the students’ writing ability to collocate words in a sentence since the writer has found that so many students of English both EFL/ESL have yet to be able to do such thing so far. It is claimed by a linguists that one of the factors that learners of language are successful in learning language is because of the social customs of native speakers in which the social customs involve the way to converse and to write in a language that native speakers practice in their daily life. One example is collocation. Ellis (1985:11) states that learners who are interested in the social and cultural customs of native speakers of the language they tend to be more successful. According to Michael (2006: 06) a collocation is a pair or group of words that are often used together. The combination sound natural to native speakers, but the students of English have to make a special effort to learn them because they are often difficult to guess. The statement above gives us awareness of how to collocate the words well in order to be natural. The students sometimes have difficulty to collocate their words in a sentence. As a result, they make errors and eventually sound unnatural. Therefore, this study aims at improving the students’ ability to collocate the words in the sentence by practicing collocation learning. The students, later on, may learn not only arranging the words but also collocating the words well in a sentence based on the rules of English collocation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>II &nbsp;MATERIALS AND METHOD</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2.1 &nbsp;L</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ITERATURE </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">R</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">EVIEW</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">In this part, the researcher provides a clear account of collocation based on the theoretical perspectives; this consists of the definition of collocation including what collocation is and why we learn it, varieties of collocation including metaphor, intensifying and softening adverb communicating, and several examples of collocation including three topics such as behavior, weather, and religion. Michael and Felicity (2008: 04) notes that collocation means a natural combination of words; it refers to the way English words are closely associated with each other. For example, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pay</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Attention</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Go</span><span class="font4"> with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Together</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Blond</span><span class="font4"> goes with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hair</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Heavy</span><span class="font4"> with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rain</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Michael clearly states that collocation is a combination of words arranged to be natural, this is the reason why the EFL/ESL have to learn collocation both writing and speaking so as to be native speakerlike. As Michael (2008: 04) says “English learners need to learn collocation because they will help you to speak and write English in a more natural and accurate way”. Collocations are not just a matter of how adjectives combine with nouns. They can refer to any find of typical word combination. For example Verb + Noun (e.g. arouse someone’s interest, lead a seminar) Adverb + Verb (e.g. flatly contradict) Noun + Noun (a lick of paint) and so forth (Michael and Felicity, 2008: 06).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to the reason above, learning collocation is also of great benefit i.e. use the words you know more accurately, sound more natural when you speak and write, vary your speech and your writing and understand when skillful writer departs from normal patterns of collocation. (a journalist, poet, advertiser, etc.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Michael &amp;&nbsp;Felicity (2008: 16 – 20) states that there is a wide range of collocation as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">EGISTER</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">In most languages, particularly in English, you will find formal and informal expressions. For example, if your close friend hosts a party, then you say “Thanks for the party, it was a blast”. This is informal expression. However, when your boss was the host, then you would probably say. “Thanks for the party, I really enjoyed it”. It was informal expression. L2 learners should also consider using both formal and informal language. Example of the register as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The police are </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">investigating/looking into</span><span class="font3"> the arms deal (Neutral)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The cops are trying to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">dig out info about</span><span class="font3"> the arms deal (Informal)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The police are </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">conducting an investigation</span><span class="font3"> into the arms deal (Formal)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The researcher seeks to provide the data of the study. The data was collected from the students’ writing results in translating the words in a sentence based on their background knowledge of collocation. The researcher acquired the data from the postgraduate program of University of Islam Malang consisting of 5 students, particularly in Class C of the first semester. The data was derived from on the16th of January, 2018 while the students were studying one of their subjects of English. At that moment, the researcher conducted a small research through surveying their writing ability in English. The researcher used scientific instrument i.e. direct questionnaires. The researcher provided the students with questionnaires that contain the words in Indonesian in order for the students to be able to translate them into English easily. The researcher then went over the students’ errors in writing with regard to the collocation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following are the questions that are to be answered by the students. In this section, the students are assigned to translate the sentence into English using their own background knowledge of collocation. They are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Pertemuan itu akan ditunda sampai minggu depan”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ Ibu saya saat ini sedang menjalani pembedahan”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Saya sangat menganjurkan agar dia belajar dengan orang orang yang berpendidikan”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Setelah seminggu, dia mendapatkan teman baru”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Saya dapa tmenarik kesimpulan bahwa dia telah melakukan kejahatan”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The data obtained by observation. The researcher provided some questions that will subsequently be answered by the students. Students are asked to answer the questions immediately on the paper. In this case, the researcher limited the study. He only carried out the research on five students since the time was limited. The questions above consist of five series of questions. Each student received one question. The researcher directly observed the students’ writing singly by walking around them. Students are only given fifteenth minutes to complete their tasks. When the time is up, the students must submit it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The students’ writing errors in combining with words in the sentence are accounted for below. The followings are the findings taken from some of the students’ writing errors in collocation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pertemuan itu akan ditunda sampai minggu depan</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yasin: “The meeting will be </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">postponed </span><span class="font3">until next week”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The results of the students’ writing errors in collocation are discussed as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Pertemuan itu akan ditunda sampai minggu depan)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yasin “The meeting will be </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">postponed</span><span class="font3"> until next week”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This sentence has a wrong combination of word. Michael and Felicity (2008: 08) notes that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">adjourn</span><span class="font4"> is very strongly associated with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">meeting and trial</span><span class="font4">. Yasin writes a word “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">postponed</span><span class="font4">” in the sentence, so it is wrong. Although </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">postponed</span><span class="font4"> has the same meaning as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">adjourn</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">adjourn</span><span class="font4"> is appropriate vocabulary to be collocated with “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">meeting and trial</span><span class="font4">”. The sentence must be “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the meeting will be adjourned until next week</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Ibu saya saat ini sedang menjalani pembedahan)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Umi – “My mother is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">passing through</span><span class="font3"> surgery right now”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Passing through</span><span class="font4"> is not collocated with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">surgery</span><span class="font4">. Colin, et al (2009: 774) states that surgery is collocated with some verbs: Verb + Surgery: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">have, undergo, perform, need, require</span><span class="font4">. Thus, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pass through is not appropriate</span><span class="font4"> verb for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">surgery</span><span class="font4">, she can use “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">undergo</span><span class="font4">” or “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">perform</span><span class="font4">”. That should be: My mother is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">undergoing surgery</span><span class="font4"> right now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Saya sangat menganjurkan agar dia belajar dengan orang-orang yang berpendidikan)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yogi: “I </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">very encourage</span><span class="font3"> that he studies with educated people”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is also obvious that the word “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">encourage</span><span class="font4">” is not appropriate for suggestion or recommendation. The best word to replace it is “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">recommend</span><span class="font4">”. Whereas “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">very</span><span class="font4">” is not natural either to be used in the sentence since “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">recommend</span><span class="font4">” has a particular adverb “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Strongly</span><span class="font4">”. Thus, the sentence must be “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I strongly recommend her studying with highly educated people</span><span class="font4">. As Colin, et al (2009:628) suggests that in giving advice to do something, the adverb of recommendation is “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Strongly</span><span class="font4">”. For example: I would </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">strongly recommend</span><span class="font4"> that you get professional advice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Rinda: &nbsp;“After a week, he </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">got</span><span class="font3"> a new friend”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The verb “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">get</span><span class="font4">” is not collocated with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">friend</span><span class="font4">. Instead </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">friend</span><span class="font4"> is collocated with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">make, find, become, remain, stay, win, and have.</span><span class="font4"> (Colin, et al. 2009: 329). Therefore, it is supposed to be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">After a week, he made a new friend”</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Saya dapat menarik kesimpulan bahwa dia telah melakukan kejahatan)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Dini: &nbsp;“I can </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">make a conclusion</span><span class="font3"> that he has </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">done a crime</span><span class="font3">”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although that is grammatically correct, based on the collocation, however, that is wrong. The verb “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">make</span><span class="font4">” is not collocated with “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">conclusion</span><span class="font4">” and neither is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font4"> with crime. Colin, et al.(2009: 146) notes that the Verb + Conclusion: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">draw, arrive at, come to, reach.</span><span class="font4"> While the Verb + Crime: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">carry out, commit, report.</span><span class="font4"> For example: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“You committed a crime”. “Many crimes are never reported to the police”.</span><span class="font4"> Therefore, the Dini’s sentence above is error in collocation. The sentence should be “</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I can draw a conclusion that he has committed a crime”.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>IV &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSION</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">It is very important to recall that most EFL/EFL Students, so far, still have been committing errors in collocation; especially in placing the word with which word it should collocate. These errors are caused by their lack of knowledge on collocation even having no knowledge of it. Therefore, since the researcher has discovered some mistakes from the students, the best way to improve their writing ability is by learning collocation. The students will subsequently know exactly appropriate words they will use in the sentence in order to be natural-sounding English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the researcher has provided the students with some knowledge of collocation. The researcher expects both EFL/ESL students to be more careful of using words in a sentence. They may learn some from this paper or from other resources concerning collocation learning.</span></p>
