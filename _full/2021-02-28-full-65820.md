<p><span class="font3">In 2019, exactly one decade of the government expenditure on education in Indonesia (central and local government) was allocated 20 percent. The purpose of this study was to analyze the causality relationship between government budget on education, education success (proxied by the mean years of schooling), and poverty (proxied by the number of poor people) in Indonesia. The data analyzed is secondary data, to be precise panel data from 34 provinces in Indonesia over a period of five years (20152019). The analysis technique used is the Granger Causality Test. The results showed that the government budget on education had a significant effect on the mean years of schooling and had a causal relationship with poverty. Meanwhile, poverty has been shown to affect the mean years of schooling. Based on the results of this analysis, it is for the government to consistently prioritize the budget for the education sector because it is proven to have an impact on education success and poverty alleviation. In addition, the government also needs to pursue poverty alleviation programs such as subsidizing cash assistance for student in poverty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ABSTRAK</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tahun 2019 tepat satu dekade anggaran pendidikan di Indonesia (pusat maupun daerah) dialokasikan sebesar 20 persen. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk menganalisis hubungan kausalitas antara anggaran bidang pendidikan, keberhasilan pendidikan (diproksi dengan rata-rata lama sekolah), dan kemiskinan (diproksi dengan jumlah penduduk miskin) di Indonesia. Data yang dianalisis merupakan data sekunder, tepatnya data panel dari 34 provinsi di Indonesia dalam kurun waktu lima tahun (2015-2019). Teknik analisis yang digunakan adalah Granger Causality Test. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa anggaran bidang pendidikan berpengaruh signifikan terhadap rata-rata lama sekolah, serta memiliki hubungan kausalitas dengan kemiskinan. Sedangkan kemiskinan terbukti mempengaruhi rata-rata lama sekolah.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Berdasarkan hasil analisis tersebut direkomendasikan bagi pemerintah agar tetap konsisten memprioritaskan anggaran untuk bidang pendidikan karena telah terbukti berdampak terhadap keberhasilan pendidikan dan kemiskinan. Selain itu pemerintah juga perlu mengupayakan program pengentasan kemiskinan seperti subsidi bantuan tunai bagi pelajar dari keluarga miskin.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as global goals, were adopted by all member states of the United Nations (UN) in 2015 as a universal call to act to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people will have peace and prosperity by 2030 (</span><a href="http://www.id.undp.or"><span class="font3">www.id.undp.or</span></a><span class="font3">).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Indonesia is a developing country that will soon become a developed country so it is very serious in realizing the SDGs. Indonesia is also one of the countries with the largest population in the world, and in 2045 it is predicted that there will be a demographic bonus in Indonesia (Wisnumurti et al., 2018). The demographic bonus is a condition in which the dependency ratio is low as a result of the high number of people at productive age (15-64 years) when</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">compared to the population at nonproductive ages (&lt;15 years and &gt;64 years). The demographic bonus can be an opportunity for the development of a country because the availability of labor will be greater. However, the demographic bonus can also become a burden if the population of productive age does not have the quality to carry out economic activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Education is a factor that really determines the quality of the nation's generation. The provision of education requires at least the cost of fulfilling the financing to provide service standards. However, the education process cannot run without money, so there needs to be support from the government, such as the APBD for education (Nandani et al., 2018).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia in Article 31 paragraph (4) mandates the allocation of an education budget of 20 percent, either through</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">central government budget intervention through the State Budget (APBN) or the Regional Revenue and Expenditure Budget (APBD). Since 2009, the government has begun to allocate a large amount of the education budget. During the period 2009–2014, the education budget allocation was the second largest budget portion of the expenditure in the APBN, after subsidies. Meanwhile, since 2015, the education budget has become the largest government expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Indonesian government took concrete actions to guarantee education financing by issuing Law Number 20 of 2003 concerning the National Education System. In Article 49 Paragraph 1 of Law Number 20 Year 2003, it is stated that &quot;Education funds are other than teachers' salaries and the State Budget (APBN) for the education sector and at least 20% of the APBD&quot;. When the education budget is adequate, then the next challenge is the distribution and utilization of education funds to suit needs, standards, and be able to have a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">real impact on realizing quality education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The results of an empirical study from Gupta (2002) states that the increase in government spending in the education sector is directly proportional to access to education and the increase in students. An increase in the share of education sector spending also has a significant effect on increasing the achievement of educational performance which is proxied by the average length of schooling (Bado and Hasbiah, 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Education and poverty are the main focus of the SDGs, and as a form of the government's political commitment to implement the SDGs, the President of the Republic of Indonesia (Joko Widodo) has signed Presidential Regulation Number 59 of 2017 concerning the Implementation of Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, the issues of poverty and education are very relevant to be studied in Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2019 is a decade of education budget allocation of 20 percent, therefore this</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">study aims to analyze the causality between the education budget, education success, and poverty in Indonesia. Moreover, several other studies regarding the education sector budget in several regions show that the impact of the education sector budget has not been optimal. As the results of research by Arifin and Murjani (2017) in South Kalimantan, it is stated that although government spending on the education and health sectors has a positive effect on HDI, this effect is relatively small, and this can indicate that the sector's spending is not optimal, both in terms of allocation and use.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>LITERATURE REVIEW</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Education is an effort to guide children from birth to reach physical and spiritual maturity, in the interaction of nature and its environment (Nurkholis, 2013). The measurement of educational success has been measured by the average length of schooling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The average length of schooling is the average number of years spent by the population aged 15 years and over</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">across all levels of formal education attended. The average length of schooling indicates the higher level of formal education achieved by the people of an area. The higher the average length of schooling, the higher the level of education undertaken. To increase the average length of schooling, the Indonesian government has launched 9 (nine) years compulsory education program or basic education to junior high school level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To get a job offered in the modern sector is based on a person's level of education, and the level of income one has during life has a positive correlation with the level of education. This level of income is greatly influenced by the length of time a person has received education (Todaro, 2000). The average length of schooling is an indicator of the level of education in an area. Education is a form of human capital that shows the quality of Human Resources (HR).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Figure 1 provides an illustration of expected personal income/benefits and actual personal costs associated with one's education level then completed (in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">years). The higher a person's education level, the faster the expected income increase, greater than the personal costs that must be incurred. To be able to maximize the difference between</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">expected benefits and estimated costs, the optimal strategy for someone is to try to complete education as high as possible (Todaro, 2000).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government Expenditure (Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sector)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Government spending is a budget allocation prepared in the APBN and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">government spending for the purchase of goods and services; (2) government spending on employee salaries; and (3) government spending for transfer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">APBD in various sectors with the aim of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">payments (Boediono, 1999).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">realizing public welfare with government programs (Arifin and Murjani, 2017). In macroeconomic theory, government spending consists of three main posts, namely: (1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Government expenditure in real terms can be used as an indicator of the size of government activities financed by government spending. The bigger and the more government activities, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">greater the government expenditure concerned (Suparmoko, 1987).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With regard to government spending in the education sector as regulated in Government Regulation (PP) Number 38 of 2007 concerning the division of government affairs between the central government, provincial government and district/city governments, it is stated that the education sector budget in districts/cities is the expenditure budget used. to provide educational services in accordance with the mandatory affairs of the district/city government (Bado and Hasbiah, 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Poverty Theory</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics, poverty is the inability to meet the minimum standard of basic needs which includes food and non-food needs. Poverty can be measured by comparing the level of a person's consumption with the poverty line or the amount of rupiah spent on people's consumption per month. Basically, the definition of poverty can be seen from two sides, namely absolute poverty and relative poverty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Todaro (2000) states that variations in poverty in developing countries are caused by several factors, namely: (1) geographic differences, population and income levels, (2) historical differences, some were colonized by different countries, (3) differences in source wealth natural resources and the quality of human resources, (4) differences in the roles of the private sector and the state, (5) differences in industrial structure, (6) differences in the degree of dependence on the economic and political power of other countries and, (7) differences in power distribution, political structures and domestic institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Meanwhile, according to Jhingan (1992), there are three main characteristics of developing countries which are both causes and consequences of poverty which are interrelated. First, inadequate educational infrastructure and facilities, resulting in a high number of illiterate people who do not have skills or expertise. Second, poor health facilities and consumption patterns, so that only a small portion of the population can</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">become productive workers. Third, the population is concentrated in the agricultural and mining sectors with outdated and outdated production methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Meier and Baldwin (in Jhingan, 1992) underdeveloped countries are generally entangled in what is called a &quot;vicious cycle of poverty&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Figure 2: A Vicious Circle of Human Underdevelopment</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Backwardness of human</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Source: Jhingan, 1992)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Figure 2 shows that this vicious cycle is caused by underdevelopment of humans and natural resources. The development of natural resources in a country depends on the productive capabilities of its people. If the country's population is underdeveloped and illiterate, there is scarcity of technical skills, knowledge and entrepreneurial activities, then the existing natural resources will remain neglected, lacking or even misused. On the other hand, this underdevelopment of natural resources causes human backwardness. Underdevelopment of natural resources is both a cause and a result of human backwardness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Research Framework</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bado and Hasbiah's (2017) research on the growth of education sector spending in South Sulawesi found that an increase in the share of education sector spending has a significant effect on increasing education performance achievement proxied by the average length of schooling. Likewise, Rony's research (2016) on the analysis of the determinants of the average length of schooling in West Kalimantan Province also found that the number of teachers and the education budget had a significant effect on the average length of schooling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The results of research by Afzal et al. (2010) on the relationship between education and poverty show that there</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">is a causal relationship between education and economic growth, economic growth and poverty, poverty and education. Likewise the research of Knight et al. (2008) who found that poverty affects the quality and quantity of education which in turn contributes to poverty. In addition, it was also found that the level of education causes differences in household income and also has an impact on poverty (Suasih et al., 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Poverty makes poor people unable to take many opportunities, including educational opportunities, and this is caused by an imbalance in the social structure of society. Faturochman and Ambar (2011) explain that there is a kind of &quot;vicious circle&quot; between educational success and poverty, which means that education for the poor is not optimal because they are poor, otherwise they will remain poor because it is not optimal in education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Widyastuti's (2012) research results also show a significant causal relationship between education and poverty. A prosperous family will be able to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">provide opportunities for family members to obtain a high level of education, so that it will bring more prosperity. The level of education certainly determines the skills possessed by the workforce. Samirin (2014) explains that one of the causes of the high number of unemployed is the large gap between the knowledge and skills of the workforce and the skills needed. This gap is usually experienced by those who do not have access to quality education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to the results of previous research conducted by Afzal et al., (2010) entitled &quot;The Relationship Between Education, Poverty and Economic Growth in Pakistan: Econometric Analysis Method&quot; Toda-Yamamoto Granger Causality Augmented (TYAGI) method, there is a cause for the relationship between education and growth. economy, economic growth and poverty, poverty and education. The study also recommends that the government should reduce poverty and improve education. The results of Afzal's study</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">are also supported by the results of research and Knight et al. (2008) entitled &quot;Education and the Poverty Trap in Rural China&quot; found that poverty has a detrimental effect on the quality and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">quantity of education. which contributes to the poverty trap. Furthermore, when viewed from the influence of education,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The conceptual framework of this research is presented in Figure 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">This research is a quantitative study using secondary data. Secondary data used comes from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) of the Republic of Indonesia and the Regional Education Balance (Ministry of Education and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Culture). Secondary data used is panel data, namely data from 34 provinces in Indonesia with the data period 20152019. The data analysis technique used the Granger Causality Test (Batubara and Saskara, 2015), which was preceded by a unit root test and a lag length test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The causality relationship is a shortterm relationship between certain groups using an econometric approach that includes a reciprocal relationship (Fauzi, 2007). With the optimal lag length, p, the Granger causality test</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In the first pooled model regression equation (1), X affects Y or the one-way causality relationship from X to Y if the coefficient βp is not equal to zero (0). Likewise for the second pooled model regression equation (2), Y affects X or there is a one-way causality relationship from Y to X if the coefficient βp is not equal to zero. Meanwhile, if both occur, it is said that there is a reciprocal relationship (feedback relationship) between X and Y or there is a two-way causality (bidirectional causality) between X and Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this study, the Granger causality test was conducted to analyze the relationship between education budget variables, educational success, and poverty in panel data. The analysis was carried out using econometric software (Eviews), the null hypothesis used was:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Unit Root Test</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Before carrying out the Granger Causality Test, a unit root test is carried out so that the data becomes stationary.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">Ta ble 1 shows that the probability value for all test methods is smaller than the critical value of 0.01. So it can be said</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Discussion</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the results of hypothesis testing, it is found that the education budget in Indonesia has a significant</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">effect on the success of education which is proxied by the average length of schooling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The education budget, which has been allocated the highest (20 percent) for a decade by the government, is carried out to ensure that all Indonesian people get access to education which is their right. Education is calculated as a determining factor for one's success, both socially and economically (Schuktz, 1961).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The results of this study also indicate that the education budget on educational success occurs 3 (three) years after the budget year (three years lag).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ilhami (2014) in his research states that there is a positive linear relationship between the percentage increase in the per capita education budget for school age and the percentage increase in the Human Development Index (HDI). Where education is one of the HDI determining variables which can be assessed one of them from the average length of schooling. Meanwhile, the current average length of schooling has</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">not been taken into account in determining the education budget allocation. In fact, by assessing the average length of schooling, it can be used as material for evaluating the education budget of a region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The education budget is also statistically proven to have a causal relationship with poverty. Policies in the education budget sector should cover the costs incurred by parents of students because of the mandate of the 1945 Constitution, education should be free (Kamsol et. Al, 2014). Kamsol et al (2014) explained that in the basic concept of education financing, there are two important things that need to be studied, namely the overall cost (total cost) and the unit cost per student (unit cost). Research results by Kamsol et. al (2014) regarding the budget and cost of education in Riau found that parents of students spent more non-education costs at the SD (elementary school), SMP (junior high school), and SMA/SMK (senior high school) levels, such as building</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">donations, routine tuition, tutoring, study tours, and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The use of the education budget is influenced by the economic conditions of students and the region concerned. This is because the government has not regulated the allocation of the budget in detail according to regional characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the results of hypothesis testing, it is found that poverty has a significant effect on the success of education in Indonesia. In line with the results of previous research conducted by Sesmiati (2009) which found that parents' income had a significant and negative effect on the drop out rate in Kenagarian Batu Plano. Likewise, Izzaty's research (2009) states that poverty has a significant and negative effect on educational equality. Todaro and Smith (2004) state the theory that &quot;people because of poverty are unable to continue their education will be in the group of people who have dropped out of school or are uneducated&quot;.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the results of data analysis, it can be concluded that statistically, the education budget has a significant effect on the success of education. Furthermore, it is also evident that the education budget has a causal relationship with poverty. Meanwhile, poverty is proven to affect the success of education in Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a follow-up to the research results, it is recommended that the government conduct an evaluation of the output-oriented education budget planning, one of which is through an evaluation of the average length of schooling. The budget that has been made so far is dominant to meet school needs and teacher fees. In addition, several education fund programs, such as School Operational Assistance (BOS) throughout Indonesia, are still uniform in number, even though the needs and conditions in each region in Indonesia are certainly not the same. In addition, considering that there are non-educational costs that students' parents also need to prepare, the government</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">should provide cash assistance for students from poor families to prevent dropping out of school, increase the average length of schooling, and reduce expenses for poor families.</span></p>
