A Gene encoding Larabinofuranosidase abfa that had been cloned into recombinant E coliDH5apTP510 was subcloned into Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast system The aim of subcloning of abfA gene intoS cerevisiae is to express the thermostable Larabinofuranosidase AbfA enzyme in the host that is often termedas Generally Recognized As Safe GRAS so that this enzyme earn the broader application like in food and beverageindustries The gene of abfA was subclone
