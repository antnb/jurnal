<p><span class="font2">The travel of tourists to a destination forms a pattern of tourist travel. Likewise, a tourist's journey during a trip has an influence on satisfaction and tourists in terms of the choice of destinations visited, memories made, joy in traveling, as well as the tendency to be more important between the chosen destinations compared to travel companions. This study aims to analyze the pattern of tourist travel and the index of tourist satisfaction with travel companions in traveling in Bali. This study uses a large sample with the Slovin formula for an error level of 4 percent. Questionnaires were distributed by accident to 600 tourists. This study uses a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods with data collection techniques through direct observation (observation), interviews (interviews), distributing questionnaires (questionnaires) with Likert scale techniques. The data analysis technique used is Importance Performance Analysis (IPA), Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) or the Consumer Satisfaction Index and Qualitative Descriptive with Likert Scale technique. The characteristics of tourists who travel to Bali are relatively young adults in terms of age and education and a high level of mastery of technology. Most tourists look for information on the internet in addition to recommendations from family and friends before tourists travel to Bali. This reflects that there has been a change in the use of travel services, media promotion, advertising and other prints. The pattern of door trips visiting Bali shows a spider web pattern, which is the first center (hub) pattern from entering tourist attractions spread across regencies/cities in Bali. The level of suitability of travel indicators in traveling in Bali shows that it is not appropriate or does not meet the expectations of tourists to Bali in general. Tourist satisfaction with travel companions in the index of traveling in Bali is 83.97 (very satisfied/appropriate).</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The nature of tourism is the whole activity caused by human travel, both individuals and groups with diverse motivations causing demand for goods and services (Suwena and Arismayanti, 2020). The movement here is in the form of a human journey, which is different from the notion of mobilization or urbanization. Travel in tourism is an intentional activity to function as a communication tool and as a liaison for interaction between people in various countries or even continents, with the aim of satisfaction or entertainment and not the interest to obtain a source of life (business). Tourism destinations experience dynamics. Originally aimed at satisfaction. However, in its development, the goal shifted to tourism in the industrial realm, reaching various fields of interest, including socio-political (conventions), cultural missions, sports, and religion (spiritual, religious). Tourism in this sense is a very basic human need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The study of tourism must depart from humans as symptoms, humans in a holistic perspective that is not divided between humans who travel and tourist attractions as tourist destinations, and services as industry (Ben, 2018; Suwena and Aris-mayanti, 2020). Meanwhile, tourists are human beings, not goods without an identity; Travel is part of the human phenomenon, namely being aware and its activities as a process of being or not being oneself. So, the nature of tourism has expanded, that tourism is an awareness of the reality of humans who travel to a destination. In supporting tourism, all activities occur and can be carried out by the government, the business world, the community in the area or tourist destination country. In the process of these activities, as a whole, they can have a major influence on economic, social, cultural, and political life as well as security to be utilized for the benefit of the development of a country and a nation. </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font2">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tourism is highly dependent on the quality of the tourist experience and the consequences of tourists' assessment of their satisfaction or dissatisfaction (Lad-hari, 2009; Saha and Theingi, 2009; Filieri et al., 2017). Therefore, it is important for tourism businesses to understand the importance of tourists' perceptions of their experiences, work hard to measure them, and continuously improve ways to satisfy tourists. A memorable tourism experience will lead to perceptions of service quality, tourist satisfaction, and post-consumption behavioral intentions (Filieri et al, 2017).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bali itself is starting to face the back impact of tourism, such as the length of stay of tourists is getting lower, tourist spending is getting less, urbanization, congestion, garbage, and security disturbances (Tirto id, 2018). Bali Tourism Statistics Data (2018) records the stay of foreign tourists in the last ten years (20082018) an average of 9.60 days with an average growth rate of 0.01 percent, while domestic tourists average 3 .91 days with an average growth rate of 0.02 percent. The length of stay of tourists has increased, but is quite low. If we compare the average growth in the length of stay of tourists in 2009-2013 with 2014-2018, foreign tourists have increased by 0.02 percent and domestic tourists have remained on average. The quality of the experience becomes very important which will shape the satisfaction and loyalty of tourists visiting a tourism destination. The overall image of a destination not only affects the destination selection process, but also the behavioral intentions of tourists in general (Qu et al., 2011). The quality of tourism destinations significantly affects tourist satisfaction which in turn affects behavioral intentions significantly (Rajaratnam et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017). Tourists who come to visit are expected to get an experience that matches their expectations. A good experience will leave good memories and create a positive image of a tourism destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tourists in the future, will not only revisit these tourist destinations, but will provide recommendations to friends, family and other potential tourists, either directly or in reviews on the media (such as: social media, TripAdvisor, Traveloka). This study aims to analyze the travel patterns of tourists in traveling in Bali, analyze the level of satisfaction and expectations of tourists for travel companions in traveling in Bali, and analyze the index of tourist satisfaction with travel companions in traveling in Bali.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>LITERATURE REVIEW</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Previous studies using tourist satisfaction referred to in this study were conducted by Radder and Han (2013); Sukan-thasirikul and Trongpanich (2015); Smith et al. (2016); Frenandes and Cruz (2016); Aliman et al. (2016); Soteriades (2017); and Blazeska et al. (2018). Radder and Han (2013) in their research on perceived quality, visitor satisfaction, and conative loyalty at the South African Heritage Museum. Museums are increasingly being forced to pay attention to aspects related to marketing such as perceptions of service quality, satisfaction and loyalty. This study uses data from three South African heritage museums that describe the construct of perceived quality and the relationship between perceived quality, satisfaction and conative loyalty using structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The resulting quality perception model consists of two service-based dimensions (service interaction and proof of service) and two product-based dimensions (product functionality and product enrichment). Moreover, the results show that visitors perceive quality to have an indirect effect (via satisfaction) and a direct effect on their behavioral intentions, with the former effect being greater than the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The research of Sukanthasirikul and Trongpanich (2015) has research implications, namely: providing service providers </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font2">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font3">and policy decision makers with insight into tourist expectations and emotions; and policy decision makers should develop activities designed to meet the needs of tourists. The study examined the service quality of the cultural tourism experience felt by tourists in terms of satisfaction and further explored the relationship between perceived value, appraisal emotion, and customer satisfaction. A total of 327 respondents completed a survey conducted at two cultural festivals in Thailand using structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, the results revealing the immediate and positive effects of service quality on perceived value, emotional appraisal, and customer satisfaction. The study summarizes the findings and offers some interesting implications for practitioners and researchers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The findings of Smith et al. (2016) produced an industry model for use in benchmarking the nature and level of quality in tourism experiences offered by individual businesses. The study presents four contributions to the tourism literature. First, focus on group tours. Second, the interpretation of quality travel experiences through four quality filters, namely: practicality, functionality, aesthetics and familiarity. The identification of five (5) quality mediators, namely: travel leaders, locally hosted visits, travel elements, travel groups, and tourism destinations. Third, the generation of quality screening of the mediator model. Fourth, the continuation of a number of existing tourism and hospitality studies are qualitative in nature which are used to achieve a deep and meaningful understanding of the phenomenon. The research is qualitative in nature with a specific and purposive research scope providing the industry with a model to use in benchmarking the nature and degree of quality in the tourism experience offered by individual businesses. In particular, the quality filtering of the mediator model shows the main filters, mediators</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and quality-related processes that serve to attract and retain tourists which are practices related to sustaining business growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The research of Frenandes and Cruz (2016) developed a model of experience quality using a six-dimensional structure of experience quality and its impact on loyalty, satisfaction and word-of-mouth applied to the tourism industry and using the perspective of tourists, and their impact on marketing outcomes. Research findings regarding the experiential dimension and its impact on business are receiving increasing attention. Therefore, understanding the quality of experiences, their drivers and outcomes is important, especially when experience is at the core of service offerings in tourism. Research on tourism experiences is sparse and largely conceptual. The study developed a high-level, validated experience quality model in the wine tourism industry that outlines the relevance of dimensions and outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Aliman et al. (2016) in his research provides guidelines for tourism managers and destination operators to further develop better strategies to satisfy tourists to Langkawi, a well-known tourist destination in Malaysia. The study analyzed the antecedents of tourist satisfaction. Questionnaires were distributed to 500 tourists using descriptive statistical data analysis techniques, factor analysis and multiple regression. The results showed that 295 (61.2 percent) of the respondents were repeat visitors and another 187 (38.8 percent) were first time visitors. More than half (56.8 percent) of the respondents had a high level of satisfaction with an average item score of 3.90 and above. Factor analysis showed seven factors out of 33 items were used to measure the constructs. Apart from tourists' expectations, perceived quality, destination image, cost and risk, and perceived value, a new variable known as social security was identified as a predictor. Regression analysis reveals that destination image, tourist expectations, costs</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and risks, and social security have a positive and significant influence on tourist satisfaction. Social security was found to be the most important predictor of tourist satisfaction, followed by tourist expectations, destination image, and costs and risks. The findings of this study can provide guidance for tourism managers and destination operators to further develop better strategies to satisfy tourists to Langkawi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Soteriades' research (2017) aims to analyze customer experience in naturebased attractions and their effect on postconsumption behavior. The study used two theoretical frameworks (experiential economics and behavioral intention) to investigate the defining dimensions of wildlife experience for customer satisfaction, and the relationship between wildlife experience and behavioral intention. The study developed a framework for explaining consumer experience that measures the four dimensions and their relative effects on satisfaction, perceived service quality, and behavioral intentions. The results show that the experiential framework is a valid tool for the study of wildlife experiences. The context of nature-based tourism mentions that the dimensions of experience that affect perceptions of service quality and customer satisfaction are escapism and aesthetics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is also a strong correlation between wildlife experience and post-consumption behavioral intentions, particularly for word of mouth and repurchase intentions. The research extends existing theory by incorporating new elements and investigating empirically in new contexts. The study analyzes the dimensions of experience in the context of nature-based tourism and customer behavioral intentions, which is to develop a customer experience framework that measures the dimensions of their relationship to experience outcomes (perceived satisfaction and service quality) and their relative influence on behavioral intentions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Research by Blazeska et al. (2018) emphasizes the importance of permanent improvement of tourism infrastructure in promoting tourism satisfaction in destinations. Tourism infrastructure has a major influence on tourist satisfaction in tourism destinations. Tourism infrastructure is a set of tools and institutions that form the material and organizational basis for tourism development. It consists of four basic elements, namely: accommodation facilities, gastronomy facilities, accompanying facilities and communication facilities. Policies are needed to improve infrastructure, promote integration of tourist services, maintain visitor numbers and encourage guests to stay longer, visit additional locations and increase their spending. The research sample was 200 foreign visitors. The results show that tourism infrastructure has a major influence on tourist satisfaction from tourism destinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCEPT DESCRIPTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Customer Satisfaction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The measurement of customer satisfaction is one of the most important issues concerning business organizations of all kinds which is justified by the philosophy of customer orientation and the main principle of continuous improvement of modern enterprises (Grigoroudis and Siskos, 2010). Measurement of customer satisfaction can help business organizations in understanding customer behavior, in particular to identify and analyze the things that are the expectations, needs, and desires of customers. Customer satisfaction must be measured and translated into a number of measurable parameters. Satisfaction is the standard of the total product or service offered to meet customer expectations (Gerson, 1993; Hill, 1996). Olson and Dover (in Tjiptono and Chandra, 2011) state that customer expectations or expectations are customer beliefs before trying or buying a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">product, which is used as a standard or reference in assessing the performance of the product concerned. However, the conceptualization and operationalization of customer expectations is still a controversial issue, especially regarding the characteristics of specific expectations standards, the number of standards used, and the sources of expectations. Every consumer may have different pre-consumption expectations. In addition, different consumers may apply different types of expectations to different situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a review of the customer satisfaction literature conducted by Giese and Cote (2002), twenty definitions were identified that were referred to in customer satisfaction research over a thirty-year period. Although these definitions vary (even some of them are inconsistent with each other), these two experts from Washington State University found similarities in terms of three main components, namely: 1) Customer satisfaction is a response (emotional or cognitive); 2) The response concerns a particular focus (expectations, products, consumption experiences, and so on); and 3) Response occurs at a certain time (after consumption, after product/service selection, based on accumulative experience and others).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Expectations on product performance apply as a standard of comparison against the actual performance of the product. Some experts identify the concept of expectation before purchase (Wilton, 1988; Spreng, 1996 in Hasan, 2008: 62), namely: 1) Equitable performance is a normative assessment of the performance that should be received by customers compared to the costs and efforts that have been devoted to buying and consuming the product. ; 2) Ideal performance is the optimum level of performance expected by a customer; and 3) Expected performance is the level of performance that is expected or the most expected-preferred by consumers. Customer expectations will continue to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">grow according to changes in the environment that provide information and increase customer experience which will affect the level of satisfaction felt by customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Customer expectations have a big role in determining product quality and customer satisfaction. Customer expectations can be the reason the same two business organizations can be judged differently by their customers. Basically, a close relationship between the determination of quality and customer satisfaction. Evaluation of quality by using customer expectations as a reference standard. The factors that determine customer expectations, namely (Zeithaml et al., 1993):</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enduring service intensive is a factor that is stable and encourages customers to increase their sensitivity to service products;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transitory service intensive is a temporary individual factor that increases customer sensitivity to services, due to an emergency situation when the service is needed or the last service consumed;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal needs are physical, social, and psychological needs that a person feels will be the basis of his welfare which determines his expectations;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perceived service alternatives are customer perceptions of the service level of other similar companies;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-perceived service roles are customer perceptions about the level of involvement in influencing the services they receive, consumers are involved in the service delivery process;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Situational factors are all possibilities that can affect service performance which are beyond the control of the service provider; and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positive word of mouth is a positive recommendation that comes from other trusted people (experts, friends, family, and media publications) more quickly accepted as a reference, because service</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">customers have difficulty evaluating services that they have not experienced themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Schnaars (1991) stated that basically the purpose of a business is to create satisfied customers. In line with this, various attempts have been made to develop a theoretical framework to explain the determinants, formation processes and consequences of customer satisfaction. Broadly speaking, customer satisfaction research is based on three main theories, namely:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrast theory assumes that consumers will compare the actual product performance with pre-purchase expectations. If the actual performance is greater than or equal to expectations, the customer will be satisfied. Conversely, if the actual performance is lower than expectations, the customer will not be satisfied.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assimilation theory states that postpurchase evaluation is a positive function of pre-purchase consumer expectations. If the disconfirmation process &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;psychologically</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">uncomfortable, the customer is likely to perceptually distort the difference between his expectations and his performance towards the initial expectation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deviations &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">expectations tend to be accepted by the customer concerned.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assimilation-contrast theory assumes that the assimilation effect or contrast effect is a function of the level of gap between expected performance and actual performance. If the gap is large, consumers will enlarge the gap, so that the product is perceived to be much better/worse than the reality. However, if the gap is not too large, assimilation theory applies. The acceptable deviation range can be crossed, then the gap between expectations and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">performance will be significant and that's when the contrast effect takes effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Customer satisfaction is a perception, so additional effort is needed to collect, measure, analyze and explain it. Customer perception plays a key role in learning the difference between expectation and experience. The overall gap that results in dissatisfied customers is caused by (Hill, 1996):</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotion gap: the inability of business organizations to meet the expectations created in the minds of customers mainly by marketing communications.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding gaps: gaps that occur due to inaccurate understanding of customer needs and priorities by organizational managers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedural gaps: gaps occur due to the translation of customer expectations into the procedures and operating systems of the business organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behavior gap: the distinction between customer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expectations &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">organizational performance with a focus on how procedures adequately cover service delivery requirements.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perception gap: the difference between the perception of performance and reality.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The modern tourism perspective, apart from the consumer elements that determine behavior, an increasing role is played by outcomes, experiences gained at the locations visited, these experiences are valued at levels (Bowen and Clarke, 2009): 1) Personal satisfaction, the extent to which the expectations of tourists are met; 2) The needs of the host community are understood in the complexities of the community, namely economic growth and prosperity, preservation of customs and traditions; as well as 3) Environmental quality.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Tourist Concept and Tourist Experience</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The concept of visitors and tourists referred to in this study is according to the World Tourism Organization (WTO, 1993; Suwena and Arismayanti, 2020) which defines visitors as people who travel to other areas outside of their daily environment for a period of not more than 12 consecutive months, participate with the purpose of travel not to earn a living in the area. Tourists are visitors who stay overnight or visitors who stay in the destination area for at least one night in accommodation at the destination visited. Daily visitors (excursionists) are visitors who do not stay overnight in public or private accommodation in the destination area. Tourists are people who travel and their needs are the main driving force behind destination planning, development and management.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tourist experience is an interaction between tourists and tourist destinations, where the tourist destination becomes the site of the experience and tourists become the actor of the experience (Stamboulis and Skayannis, 2003). Larsen (2007) argues that a tourist experience should be defined as a past travel-related event that is significant enough to be stored in long-term memory. Selstad (2007) defines the tourist experience as a combination of novelty in the search for individual identity and selfrealization. Factors that influence the tourist experience, namely: visitors, products (or tourism destinations), and local communities. Visitors arrive at tourism destinations with perceptions of the type of experience influenced by the individual's social construction and perceptions derived from media, product information and descriptions, prior knowledge, expectations, and previous travel experiences. Tourism products generally refer to experiences with the tourism industry, the public sector, and formal cultural intermediaries (such as travel agents or tour guides).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This study uses a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods with data collection techniques through direct observation (observation), interviews (interviews), distributing questionnaires (questionnaires) with Likert scale techniques. The data analysis technique used is Importance Performance Analysis (IPA), Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) or the Consumer Satisfaction Index and Qualitative Descriptive with Likert Scale technique. Qualitative descriptive analysis technique is the process of arranging the sequence of data, organizing it into a pattern, category, and a basic description. Or the process of organizing and sorting data into patterns, categories, and basic units of description so that themes can be found and working hypotheses can be formulated as suggested by the data. CSI is used to determine the overall level of consumer satisfaction by looking at the level of satisfaction and importance of pro-duct/service attributes. This method has advantages, including: efficiency (not only the satisfaction index, but also obtains information related to the dimensions/attri-butes that need to be improved), easy to use and simple and uses a scale that has high sensitivity and reliability. The maximum CSI value is 100 percent, the CSI value 50 percent indicates poor service performance or performance, and vice versa. The CSI criteria in this study refer to the Aritonang (2005) reference, as shown in Table 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The characteristics of tourists who travel to six tourist attractions are a reflection of the characteristics of tourists who travel to Bali. This requires the readiness of tourist attractions in particular and Bali tourism destinations in general in dealing with the type of tourists who are relatively young adults in terms of age and education as well as a high level of mastery of technology. Most tourists look for information on the internet in addition to recommendations from family and friends before tourists travel to Bali. This reflects that there has been a shift towards the use of travel agency services, advertising promotion media and other prints to be abandoned by tourists. Likewise, the way tourists search for information and make reservations for accommodation and modes of transportation used while traveling in Bali, mostly utilize information technology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Differences in tourist characteristics based on nationality, especially for Asian tourists, are strongly influenced by travel planning carried out by student bus groups who choose popular tourist attractions, affordable entrance tickets, require relatively short travel time and have a large parking</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">area. For example, Penglipuran and Tanah Lot villages, except for the Banjar Hot Springs tourist attraction which is visited by many local people and local tourists from several districts/cities in Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The characteristics of tourists when viewed from the type of work, namely the dominant private employees, reflect the type of millennial tourists who have a tendency to be relatively young in age, have just finished their studies, have just started work, or have just gotten married, and in their daily life they generally carry out activities together between education, work and travel. This type of tourist has a tendency to try new tourist attractions and tourist destinations for their next tourist destination. Even though it is a special tourist attraction, Lovina is very popular with retired tourists who have repeat visits and longer stays. Bali must be careful with the relatively low number of repeat tourist visits compared to first-time tourist visits because it reflects the low level of loyalty of tourists who travel to Bali.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Travel Patterns of Tourists Visiting Bali</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The travel pattern of tourists visiting Bali shows the first central (hub) pattern from the entrance of Bali (Ngurah Rai Airport for foreign and domestic tourists, Gil-imanuk Harbor is dominated by domestic tourists, Padang Bai Harbor and Tanjung Benoa Harbor) then to several tourist attractions that spread across regencies/cities in Bali. When tourists visit Bali through these four entrances, tourists then visit tourist attractions in the Regency / City in Bali. Tourist travel patterns do not indicate that the tourist attraction closest to the tourist entrance is the main choice. Tourists randomly select their desired travel destination. Likewise, the next tourist destination shows an irregular pattern, the choice of tourists does not always show the closest choice to the previous tourist destination. Tourists in choosing a tourist destination are very dependent on information available on the internet (websites and social media), accommodation reservations before arrival, and travel plans for tourists in groups using large buses or mini buses. Domestic tourists who use private vehicles, the choice of tourist attraction to be visited seems more flexible and depends on internal and external situations and conditions that influence it.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/92111-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:113pt;">

<p><span class="font3">Based on the CSI calculation on the indicators of traveling companions in traveling in Bali, it can be seen that the index of tourist satisfaction with traveling companions in traveling in Bali is 83.97 (very satisfied/appropriate). Travel is about creating a series of beautiful and amazing memories, satisfaction and extraordinary experiences for tourists. Service providers must strive to create tourist trips that tourists can always remember and travel companions of their choice in traveling. Because travel companions are very decisive and form the memory of tourists in traveling to a destination.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The travel pattern of tourists visiting Bali shows the first central (hub) pattern from the entrance of Bali (Airport Ngurah Rai for foreign and domestic tourists. The tourist travel pattern does not indicate that the tourist attraction closest to the tourist entrance is the main choice. Tourists in choosing a tourist destination, it is very dependent on the information available on the internet (websites and social media), accommodation reservations before arrival, and travel plans for tourists in groups using large buses or mini buses. Domestic tourists who use private vehicles, the choice of tourist attractions which will be visited seem more flexible and depends on the internal and external situations and conditions that influence it. The level of performance on the indicators of traveling</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">companions in traveling in Bali has an interval score of 3.90 to 4.38 with good to very good measurement criteria. The performance level on the travel companion indicator in traveling in Bali shows the highest score on the Travel companion indicator creates lasting memories on trips to tourism destinations (4.29/very good or appropriate). While the lowest score on the Travel companion indicator is more important than tourism destinations (4,10/good or appropriate). The highest score on the Travel companion indicator creating deep memories on trips to tourism destinations is also shown in the tourist attractions sampled in this study with a score interval of 4.11 (Tirta Empul) to 4.41 (Monkey Forest).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The level of expectation on the indicators of traveling companions in traveling in Bali has an interval score of 4.19 to 4.37 with good to very good measurement criteria. The level of expectation on the travel companion indicator in traveling in Bali shows the highest score on the Travel companion indicator creating deep memories on trips to tourism destinations (4.37/very good or appropriate). While the lowest score on the Travel companion indicator is more important than tourism destinations (4.19/good or appropriate). The highest score on the Travel companion indicator creating deep memories on trips to tourism destinations is also shown in the tourist attractions sampled in this study with a score interval of 4.19 (Tirta Empul) to 4.40 (Penglipuran Tourism Village).

<p><span class="font3">of suitability of the indicators of traveling companions in traveling in Bali shows that they are not appropriate or have not met the expectations of tourists to Bali in general. However, the indicators of travel companions creating deep memories on trips to tourism destinations on the tourist attraction of Monkey Forest (101, 61) and indicators of traveling companions affecting the pleasure of traveling to tourism destinations on the tourist attraction of Lovina (101,75) are appropriate or meet tourist expectations. The index of tourist satisfaction with traveling companions in Bali is 83.97 (very satisfied/appropriate).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The suggestions that can be submitted in this research are: the importance of providing information (online and offline) for tourists (considering that the dominant traveler is a first time visit) as well as providing a platform that is able to detect tourist travel patterns based on tourist entrances and demographics, as well as making it easier for tourists to make reservations for tourist attractions, amenities and other tourism services. The need for efforts to improve the performance of travel companions in traveling in Bali and in tourist attractions in Bali. The need to involve psychological factors in the relationship in the offer of tour packages and promotions as well as the provision of other tourism services targeting small tourist groups who have great opportunities as travel companions for these tourists on their trips. The importance of increasing the tourist satisfaction index in traveling with travel companions by offering products that are more personal, custom, and specific.</span></p>
