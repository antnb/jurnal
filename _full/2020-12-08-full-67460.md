<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In the development of an increasingly globalized world, English is needed to communicate and interact between various countries. English is very much needed to support the development of science and technology and the demands of an increasingly advanced and modern era. Mastery of English skills as an international communication tool aims to socialize in the era of globalization. By mastering the English, someone will have a higher selling value than others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are at least several important reasons for learning and mastering English, that is (Dewi and Lulut, 2018: 145-146): a) English is the language most often used by foreign language speakers around the world. b) Mastering English can increase person's value and will be more respected in the international world of work. c) English is the international language used in communication, especially in the business world, one example is communication in business. d) Many learning resources, both from books and internet media, use English. So, by mastering English, one can increase knowledge from these various sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the important English skills to be learned and mastered that is reading skill (Herlina, 2016: 29). Reading skill are an interactive process involving readers, reading and context. This skill involves the ability to derive meaning from written text (Silliman and Wilkinson in Herlina, 2016: 30). Reading skill in learning English is considered important</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">because it can determine how well a person is able to absorb information obtained from written texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The importance of reading skill in the global era makes it mandatory for everyone to master it, including students. Students as the nation's next generation and as a foundation for the development of a country should master English, including reading skill. Students are required to have reading skill because many learning sources both from books and internet media use English. So, by mastering English, students can increase their knowledge from various sources (Dewi and Lulut, 2018: 146). In addition, in the current global era, students are required to take part in many international activities such as student exchanges, conferences, summer schools, competitions, internships, and others, where these international activities require the ability to read in English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The importance of mastering reading in English makes students have to improve their reading skills. The higher the reading ability of students, the higher the level of student understanding of a writing (Mulyadi, 2015). In addition, students will also understand the outline of a text more quickly, so that students will save more time. In measuring how much a student's reading ability, so reading examinations are held in English courses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Reading examination is a systematic method for gathering information and making conclusions about a student's ability or quality or success in reading (Manalu., Et al. 2019: 16). In order to collect information on students' reading comprehension improvement, it is important to carry out several reading assessments. Unlike speaking and writing, the reading process cannot be seen and observed specifically. For that, all reading assessments must be done appropriately. Several considerations are needed in designing reading assessments, such as types of written text genres, components of reading ability assessments and special assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are several methods that can be used to do reading examination, one of which is google form. Google forms is one of the new methods used in reading examination because currently the world of education cannot be separated from the development of digital penetration. Digital penetration makes technology always used in everything including in the learning process, such as reading examination. Google form is a service from Google that allows someone to create surveys, questions and answers with online form features that can be customized as needed. So, by using google form, one can get answers directly from several people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Success in reading examination using google form, apart from being dependent on mastery of the material, also depends on the interaction process that begins with the perception of educational actors, that is students on reading examination (Oktariyani and Yani, 2019: 48). Perception is a process that is preceded by a sensing process, which is the process of receiving a stimulus by an individual through the senses (Mashuri in Oktariyani and Yani, 2019: 49). Therefore, the perceptual process cannot be separated from the sensing process, and the sensing process occurs every time, that is when the individual receives a stimulus that hits him through the senses. Based on this opinion, it is clear that the perception is the assumption of a person in understanding information about their environment through the five senses like students in arguing about reading examination using google form, both in terms of goals, foundations and benefits through seeing and hearing students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Perception is something that is quite important for everyone before that person is directly involved in carrying out every activity. This is because it needs consideration before carrying out an activity, so that something that is done is truly appropriate and profitable. Through perception, a person will continue to make contact with the environment and the activities that will be carried out. The main thing for them to do is to express their perceptions of the reading examination, which will affect their desire to increase their value in the reading examination (Oktariyani and Yani, 2019: 48).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are several previous studies used in this research, including research conducted by Untari (2020) which states that the benefits of online reading have had a substantial effect on the knowledge of learners' comprehension, and that students have strongly focused on the educational evaluation they read. Furthermore, research conducted by Sibuea (2018), which states that Classroom was a satisfying LMS for blended learning in Pengantar Linguistik Umum (PLU) course because of its features, user-friendliness, and appropriateness in higher education program. Then the research conducted by Muhfiyanti and Siti (2018), which states that the average student gives a good perception of the learning material of specialization in English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This research was conducted on students majoring in accounting, batch 2019, STEKOM University Semarang. The object of this study was chosen because the average reading score using google form was still low, that is 68, and there were even some students whose scores were below the average. In fact, the reading ability in English is an important component that students must have in this global era. The low reading ability is also caused by the students' perception of reading examination using google form, where reading examination using google form is still considered difficult. For this reason, research on student perception of reading examination using google form is very necessary. So, the purpose of this study was to determine the perception of students majoring in accounting, batch 2019, STEKOM University Semarang on reading examination using google form.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This type of research is descriptive quantitative. The quantitative research method according to Sugiyono (2017: 8) is a research method based on the philosophy of positivism, used to research on certain populations or samples, data collection using research instruments, quantitative or statistical data analysis with the aim of testing predetermined hypotheses. While descriptive research is a research method that aims to describe and explain the conditions that exist in the research object based on the factors and data collected, then compiled systematically (Sugiyono, 2017: 238).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The approach used in this research is a survey approach (Non-Experimental). Survey research is research that takes a sample from a population and uses a questionnaire as the main data collection tool. The questionnaire contains a number of questions that must be answered by respondents (Maksum in Oktariyani and Rani, 2019: 149). There are four main characteristics of survey research, that is: 1) using a questionnaire as the main instrument, 2) a large number of research subjects, 3) not giving treatment and 4) using deductive logic as a frame of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This research was conducted on students majoring in accounting, batch 2019, STEKOM University Semarang. The object of this study was chosen because the average reading score using google form was still low, that is 68, and there were even some students whose scores were below the average. In fact, the reading ability in English is an important component that students must have in this global era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The variable in this study was the student's perception of reading examination using google form. Perception is the assumption of a person in understanding information about their environment through their five senses, like students in arguing about reading examination using google form, both in terms of goals, foundations and benefits through students' seeing and hearing. Students' perception of reading examination using google form in this study were measured by several dimensions, including: (Sibuea, 2018:8-10): a) What do you think about reading examination. b) Do you like reading examination. c) What is your opinion on using goole form in reading examination? Is it easy or difficult to use. d) What is your opinion about the implementation of reading examination using google form. e) Does google form supported you in the reading examination. f) How long did it take you to understand how to use google form in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">reading examination. g) Did the lecturer used google form in reading examinatio effectively and efficiently. h) Is google form appropriate for reading examination in the next semester. i) Do you think google form can be implemented for other examination. j) What your opinion about the use of google form in reading examination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The population of this study were 80 students majoring in Accounting, batch 2019 at STEKOM University Semarang. Furthermore, the sampling technique in this study is total sampling. Total sampling is a sampling technique in which the number of samples is the same as the population (Sugiyono, 2017: 51). The reason for taking total sampling is because according to Sugiyono (Sugiyono, 2017: 51) the total population is less than 100, the entire population is used as the research sample. So that the number of samples in this study were 80 students majoring in accounting, batch 2019, STEKOM University Semarang.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sources of data in this study are primary and secondary. Primary data sources are data sources obtained directly from the original sources in the form of questionnaires, and others. Primary data used in this study is data obtained from respondents' responses to the question items in the questionnaire. Furthermore, secondary data sources are data sources obtained through intermediary media indirectly in the form of notebooks, existing evidence, or archives, both published and not generally published. Secondary data used in this study are data obtained from university documents and archives that are related to this research. Then the data is obtained from books, websites, journals, and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Data collection in this study was carried out using a questionnaire and documentation study. A questionnaire is a list of questions given to people who are willing to provide perceptions according to user requests. The steps used by the researcher are: a) Researchers distribute questionnaires to each sample. b) From each sample, answers are obtained in accordance with the questions given. c) All the students' answers are the data obtained in this study which are then analyzed. Meanwhile, documentation study is a data collection technique in which researcher investigate written objects such as university data, books, magazines, documents, regulations, and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The data obtained in this research is quantitative data which is then analyzed descriptively. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 16 which aims to describe each question item related to student perceptions of reading examination using google form. Furthermore, data analysis was also carried out by clarifying the average student's perception of reading examination using google form whether it was categorized as good, moderate, or bad.</span></p>
