<p><span class="font6">III.</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results and discussion</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Services are given both in the form of private and public services to fulfill the rights of the society. This means that service basically involves the fulfillment of a right. Those are attached to everybody, both individually and in groups (organizations), and are done universally. As expressed by Moenir that &quot;the right to the services is universal in nature, apply to anyone who is interested on the right, and by any organization whose duties also to carry out the services&quot;. The Government of Badung Regency in Bali continues to improve itself by increasing the human resources (HR) in order to improve public services. The Badung Regency’s Visions and Missions of 2016-2021 are strengthening the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">development in Badung based on Tri Hita Karana towards the Advanced, Peace and Prosperity Society, while the missions of Badung Regency Year 2016 – 2021 are:</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font6">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening the potential synergy of culture, agriculture and tourism in the broad sense.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Norm is a measurement or standard for a person to act and behave in society. Legal norm is one of the norms that exist in society. Legal norms can be established in writing or non-writing by the authorized institution</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Referring to the Hierarchy of Norms from Hans Kelsen, the legal order is not a system of norms that only coordinated with each other, which stand parallel or equivalent, but a hierarchy of norms of different level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hans Nawiasky, one student of Hans Kelsen developed his teacher’s theory on the hierarchy of norms related to state, namely: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Staatsfundamentalnorm</span><span class="font6"> (State Fundamental Norms), </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Staatsgrundgesetz</span><span class="font6"> (Basic Rules of a State/a State Principle Rules), </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Formell Gesetz</span><span class="font6"> (“formal” Laws) and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Verordnung &amp;&nbsp;Autonome Satzung</span><span class="font6"> (Subordinate and Autonomous Regulation). The theoretical framework of a hierarchy of Laws and Regulations refers to the hierarchy of norms theory by Hans Kelsen which can be mentioned as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law regulates its own establishment;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A norm is valid because it is made in the manner prescribed by other norms;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between norms can be expressed as the super and sub-ordinated relationships in an allegory on space;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norms that determine the establishment of other norms are the higher norms, while the established norms as such are the lower norms;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal order is not a system of norms that only coordinated with each other, which stand parallel or equivalent, but a hierarchy of norms of different levels;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unity of these norms are drafted by the fact that the establishment of a lower norm is determined by the higher norms, whose establishment is determined by the another higher norm, and this level is ended by the highest norm which is the basic norm that constitutes the main reason of validity of the whole legal system that forms a unity.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Based on the above theory on hierarchy of norms by Hans Kelsen, it is understood that the validity of a legal norm is obtained if the establishment is determined by the higher norms where such establishment includes the how to establish and the substance of legal norms. Thus, when a norm is established based on the higher norm, essentially such lower legal norm is implementing the higher legal norm. Authentically, the definition of the substance materials of Laws and Regulations is stipulated in Article 1 point 13 and related to the principle of the establishment of Laws and Regulations which is stated in Article 5 letter c of Law No. 12 of 2011. The term of &quot;substance materials of Laws and Regulations&quot; was introduced by A. Hamid S. Attamimi. He interpreted it as a typical substance materials of Laws (translation from Thorbecke’s phrase &quot;het eigenaardig onderwerp der wet&quot;), which means a typical regulatory substance that is only and solely contained in the Laws and therefore becomes the substance of Laws. Article 1 number 13 of Law No. 12 of 2011 defines substance materials of the Laws and Regulation as materials contained in Laws and Regulations according to the type, function and hierarchy of Laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Regulations on the substance materials of the types of Laws and Regulations are spreading in several articles both in single and pairs norms. Since the services are given to fulfill the rights of societies both in civil and public services therefore services are essentially related to the fulfillment of rights. Service basically involves the fulfillment of the rights attached to any person, either individually or in groups (organizations), and carried out universally. As expressed by Moenir that &quot;the right to the services is universal in nature, apply to anyone who is interested</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">on the right, and by any organization whose duties also to carry out the services&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The models of legal norms formulation in the Regional Regulation of Badung Regency No. 4 of 2015 are as follow:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formulation of a single norm: legal norm that stands alone without being followed by other legal norms thus the substance is a command legal norm.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">CHAPTER III FACILITATOR AND PERSON IN CHARGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">Article 7</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regent is the facilitator of the Implementation on Public Service in the Region.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties of the facilitator referred to in paragraph (1) shall include:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conduct training;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supervision; and</span></p></li>
<li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facilitator referred to in paragraph (1) shall report the development results of the public service performance to the People’s Legislative Council and the Governor of Bali.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal norms in pairs</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary legal norms: which contain provisions on how to act</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">For instance: Do not take other people’s goods.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary legal norms: which contain countermeasures procedures.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">For instance: Taking other people’s goods be sanctioned to 15 years imprisonment.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of primary and secondary legal norms</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">For instance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CHAPTER V</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ORGANIZER COOPERATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">Article 10</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the Organizer who has the authority and duty on Public Service which cannot be conducted alone due to limited resources and/or in a state of emergency, the Organizer may request assistance to other Organizers who have inadequate capacity.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Hamid Saleh Attamimi as a substitute of the Dutch words “</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">het onderwerp</span><span class="font6">” in Thorbecke’s expression of “</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">het eigenaadig onderwep der wet</span><span class="font6">”. Furthermore, such term defines as typical substance materials of Laws which is typical regulatory materials which only and solely contained in the specific Laws and Regulations therefore are not contained in other Laws and Regulations. If a substance material is contained in a Regional Regulation of the Regency/City it means such substance material is a typical material contained only in such Regional Regulation and not in other Laws and Regulations nor in the Regional Regulations or at the central Laws and Regulations. Article 1 number 13 of Law No. 12 of 2011 defines substance materials of the Laws and Regulation as materials contained in Laws and Regulations according to the type, function and hierarchy of Laws. There are two models of legal norms formulation in the Regional Regulation of Badung Regency No. 4 of 2015 namely: single norms and legal norms in pairs.</span></p>
