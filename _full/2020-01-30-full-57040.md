<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The people living at Taro village speak the Balinese language as their daily language. As the speakers of the Balinese languge, they never neglect the speech order, as can be seen from the fact that they still use the Balinese words, which in the modern era, have been neglected, resulting in the fact that many people are not familiar with a number of words, especially those which belong to the verb word class, one of which is the verb “ngetok” (hit). The Balinese language has a great number of verbs; however, the current study only analyses the verb “ngetok’ (hit) using the theory of Natural Metalanguage Semantics (NMS). The verb “ngetok” (hit) has a great number of equivalents; they are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ngebug, ngedig, nigtig, ngupek, megambel, mugpugin, mukpukin, ngukul, nungting, ngempug, nyakcak, noktok, ngeplokin, nebuk, ngaasin, nepung, ngintuk, ngalocok, namplak, nyemés, nempéléng, nyagur, nyepédin, nglamet, ngamplongin, ngamplengin, ngemplangin, nglentangin, ngaplekin, nyontok, nylimed</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mentil</span><span class="font3">. One verb is different from another, although they are all used to express the action of hitting something or someone, depending on what tool is used to hit and the subject and object which are hit. The verb “ngetok” (hit) in the Balinese language has two different meanings; namely doing something and taking place, which can be explained using the explication technique in which it is described that “X does something on Y, causing something either bad or good to occur to Y”. Such differences in meaning can be obtained through the analysis of the original meaning using the non-compositional polysemy</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The fact that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Wangsa</span><span class="font4"> (caste system)-based social classification does not contribute to anything to the people living at Taro village; the village can be classified as one of the old ones in Bali. In general, the Balinese language is still maintained and used as the daily language which</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the villagers speak. They still maintain the speech etiquette and even still use the spoken and written Balinese language varieties in any formal activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the current modern era many people in general and the young ones in particular do not perfectly understand and pay attention to the sense of value when they speak. Attention needs to be paid to the sense of value in any speech event. In other words, what needs to be paid attention to includes who the addressee is, where and when the speech event takes place, and the theme and aim of the speech event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Viewed from the linguistic aspect, every language has forms, functions and meanings which can be analyzed using the theory of the natural semantic metalanguage. It is expected that this theory can explain the existence of any language with its different forms in the same domain of meaning. The writer has reviewed some studies exploring several verbs in the Balinese language such as the verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngetep</span><span class="font4"> used to express the action of cutting something, and the verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">masare majujuk</span><span class="font4"> used to express the action of sleeping in the standing position. However, none has investigated the verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">memukul</span><span class="font4"> (hit) in the Balinese language. Realizing that the verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">memukul</span><span class="font4"> has a great number of equivalents in the dialect of the Balinese language spoken at Taro village, it is necessary to conduct the research entitled “The Verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Memukul</span><span class="font4"> (hit) in the Dialect of the Balinese Language Spoken at Taro Village: A Study of Natural Semantic Metalanguage”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the background of the study above, the problems of the study can be formulated as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">memukul</span><span class="font4"> (hit) like in the Balinese language from the perspective of Natural Semantic Metalanguage?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the meaning of the verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">memukul</span><span class="font4"> (hit) from the perspective of Natural Semantic Language?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">This current study is a qualitative one in which the phenomenological approach, which was adjusted to the condition of the people living at Taro village, Tegallalang District, Gianyar Regency, was used.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Type and Source</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The data used in the current study are the qualitative data, meaning that the object of the study was in the form of words instead of numbers. In other words, the object of the study is described and pictured using words instead of numbers. The data sources are divided into two; they are the primary data source and the secondary data source. The main data were obtained through observation and interview in which the interviewees were a number of people determined using the sampling random technique. The secondary data were obtained from a number of books and other references related to the study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method of Collecting Data</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The data were collected through direct observation of the object of the study in which the note taking and documentary techniques were used, and through interview in which the mixed technique was used. The informants were determined using the sampling random technique and the introspective reflective technique, in which the researcher played roles, namely as the subject as well as the object of the study. The introspective reflective technique allowed the researcher, as a native speaker of the language under study, to use his ideas, knowledge and logical reasoning</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">as the data source. The secondary data were obtained through the library and documentary research.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method of Data Analysis</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The method of data analysis in the current study includes data reduction, data presentation and conclusion drawing. According to Muhammad (2011:233), “</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Metode analisis data adalah cara menguraikan dan mengelompokkan satuan lingual sesuai dengan pola-pola, tema-tema, kategori-kategori, kaidah-kaidah dan masalah-masalah penelitian</span><span class="font4">”. (Method of data analysis refers to the way of describing and grouping lingual units based on the patterns, themes, categories, rules, and problems of the study). The results of the data analysis are descriptively and qualitatively explained.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Form of the Verb “Memukul” (hit) in the Balinese Language from the Perspective of Natural Semantic Metalanguage</span></p></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">At Taro village, many forms of the verb ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">memukul</span><span class="font4">’ (hit) in the Balinese language were found, resulting from the fact that the Balinese language is still used as the daily language by the local people. The forms of the verb ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">memukul</span><span class="font4">’ (hit) in the Balinese language were analyzed using the theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). According to Goddard (in Sudipa, 2004:146), each form of a word has specific semantic features which can differentiate it from another word in the same domain of meaning. Further, Anna Weirbicka (in Sudipa, 2004:146) stated that the theory of NSM can picture the unique semantic features of every form of a word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was found out that the verb “</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">memukul</span><span class="font4">” in the Balinese language has 32 equivalents; they are “</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngebug, ngedig, nigtig, ngupek, magambel, mugpugin, mukpukin, nungting, ngempug, ngempug, nyakcak, noktok, ngeplokin, nebuk, ngaasin, nepung, ngintuk, ngalocok, namplak, nyemés, nempéléng, nyagur, nyepédin, nglamet, ngamplongin, ngamplengin, ngemplangin, nglentangin, ngaplekin, nyontok, nylimed and mentil</span><span class="font4">.” One equivalent of the verb “</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">memukul</span><span class="font4">” in the Balinese language is different from another, depending on how the action of “</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">memukul</span><span class="font4">” (hit) is done, the tool used, the subject and object of the action, as can be explained as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The way of doing the action of “</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">memukul</span><span class="font4">” (hit) cannot be separated from the tool used for doing the action and who the subject and object of the action are.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a.</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ngebug</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngebug</span><span class="font4"> is often connected with someone who is playing the music instrument referred to as the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">gambelan</span><span class="font4"> instrument; the action of playing the gamelan instrument is referred to as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">magambel</span><span class="font4"> (playing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">gambelan</span><span class="font4"> instrument). How the verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngebug</span><span class="font4"> is used can be seen in the following sentence:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(01) </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gebugin </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">malu gongé pang énggal tawang pelihné</span><span class="font4">.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">(Hit the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">gong</span><span class="font4"> in order to be able to find out quickly what is wrong)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sentence (01) contains the verbal expression of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngebugin gong</span><span class="font4"> (hit the gong). The verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngebug</span><span class="font4"> is often used if the object of the action is what is referred to as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">gong</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kempur</span><span class="font4"> (a type of gong, which is smaller than the gong). When this musical instrument is hit, it produces the echoing sound. The tool used for hitting it is what is referred to as ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">panggul</span><span class="font4">’. Hitting it slowly from the side is the way of doing the action.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">b.</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ngedig</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The verb ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngedig</span><span class="font4">’ is also often connected with the way of hitting gamelan musical instruments such as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kendang</span><span class="font4"> (a small drum covered with leather at each end), </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">gender</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(metallopone with keys suspended on thongs or cords over sounding tubes) and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">gangsa</span><span class="font4"> (brass) as exemplified in sentence (02). The tool used for hitting such gamelan instruments is also referred to as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">panggul</span><span class="font4">, which is used for hitting the gamelan instruments quickly and hard to produce a high-pitched voice.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(02) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kendangé lantas ngedigin, mara </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ngedig </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">gender paling siduri pang nyak maadungan</span><span class="font4">.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">(The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kendang</span><span class="font4"> (drum) should be hit before the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">gender</span><span class="font4"> to make them match)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Apart from being uttered when hitting the gamelan instruments, the verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngedig</span><span class="font4"> is also uttered when hitting what is called </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">pentungan</span><span class="font4">/</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kulkul</span><span class="font4"> (a drum made from either bamboo or wood), as exemplified in sentence (03).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(03) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Krama sareng sami tunas titiang benjang idadané mangda ngayah mareresik ring Pura</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">(Everybody is kindly requested to clean the environment where Taman Beji temple is located; the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kulkul</span><span class="font4"> (the wooden drum) will be hit at 7 in the morning).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sentence (03) contains the expression </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngedig kulkul</span><span class="font4"> (hitting the wooden drum). The tool used for hitting the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kulkul</span><span class="font4"> is also referred to as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">panggul</span><span class="font4">. However, it is different from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">panggul </span><span class="font4">used for hitting the gamelan instruments; the former is always made of wood. Based on the two examples above, it can be concluded that the action of ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngedig’</span><span class="font4"> is done using the tool referred to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">panggul</span><span class="font4">; repeatedly hitting the object, which is usually rather wide and flat, is the way of doing the action of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngedig</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">c.</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigtig</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nigtig</span><span class="font4"> is an action done by repeatedly hitting something or someone using a wooden tool, broom, duster, and broom of split coconut midribs ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sapu lidi</span><span class="font4">’, as illustrated in the following example:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(04) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sing buungan Méméné nigtig panakné sawiréh bes kalu</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(The child is too naughty for his/her mother not to hit him/her)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sentence (04) contains the verbal phrase </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nigtig panak</span><span class="font4"> (hitting the child). The action of hitting the child cannot be separated from emotion. When someone who is angry hits another using a broom or wooden tool repeatedly on the waist, the action he/she does is referred to as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nigtig</span><span class="font4">. In sentence (04) what is hit is the human body. The verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nigtig</span><span class="font4"> is also used to express the action of hitting a mattress and a bucket, as illustrated in sentence (5) and sentence (6).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(05) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dé, tigtigan jep kasuré majemuh pang ilang bukné</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Dé (term of address)), hit the mattress which is exposed to the sun in order not to be dusty any longer)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(06) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Telanan nigtig ember, empeng kupingé medingehang.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(You’re kindly requested to hit the bucket slowly, it’s too noisy)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sentence (05) contains the verbal phrase </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tigtigan kasure</span><span class="font4"> (hit the mattress) and sentence (06) contains the verbal phrase </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nigtig ember</span><span class="font4"> (hit the bucket). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sentence (05) what is hit is</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">a mattress and in sentence (06) what is hit is a bucket. The action of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nigtig kasur</span><span class="font4"> (hit the mattress) is done to make the mattress clean from the dust using </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sapu lidi</span><span class="font4"> (a broom of split coconut midribs), the action of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nigtig ember</span><span class="font4"> (hit the bucket) is usually done by a child as a game. Based on the explanation above, the verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nigtig</span><span class="font4"> is used to express the action of hitting the object with a wide surface repeatedly using either a wooden tool or a broom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ngupek</span><span class="font4"> refers to an action when someone plays a gamelan instrument referred to as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kendang</span><span class="font4"> (a small drum covered with leather at each end). This action is done using the palms of hands instead of a tool. The way of doing it is that the left end is hit using the palm of the left hand and the right hand is hit using the palm of the right hand, and the object which is hit is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kendang</span><span class="font4">. Someone who observes the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kendang</span><span class="font4"> player will utter:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mugpugin</span><span class="font4"> is used to express an action of hitting someone and is often uttered when someone or a group of people fights against another or another group repeatedly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">(Now many young men like hitting others, causing them to have enemies)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In sentence (09), the verbal phrase </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mugpugin méméne</span><span class="font4"> (hitting his/her mother) is used to express the action of hitting someone in which the object is the mother and the subject is the child. The action expressed using the verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mugpugin</span><span class="font4"> is done using the clenched fist from the back and is focused on the waist or the back part of the body. In the action done in sentence (10) ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mugpugin timpal</span><span class="font4">’ (hitting another), the subject, the object and the way of doing it are almost the same as the subject, the object and the way of doing the action expressed in sentence (09). It can be concluded, therefore, that the action expressed using the verbal phrase </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mugpugin</span><span class="font4"> shows that the action is repeatedly done using the clenched fist from the back especially when the subject is emotional.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mukpukin</span><span class="font4"> is uttered only when someone hits a fruit such as a jackfruit or watermelon to know whether it is already mature or not.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">h.</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ngukul</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The action expressed using this verb cannot be separated from the society’s programs. It is the action of hitting what is locally referred to as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kulkul</span><span class="font4"> (wooden drum). The sounds produced by hitting the wooden drum are used to call the society’s members to come to the village hall. The action of hitting the wooden drum ‘ngukul’ can be divided into four; depending on how many times the wooden drum is hit. One sound, which is produced by hitting the wooden drum one time, means that there is someone who is married; three sounds, which are produced by hitting the wooden drum three times, means that there is someone who is dead; more than three sounds, which are produced by regularly and repeatedly hitting the wooden drum, mean that the society’s members are supposed to gather at the village hall; more than three sounds, which are produced by irregularly and repeatedly hitting the wooden drum, mean that there is a danger or a disaster at the village. The action of ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngukul</span><span class="font4">’ is only done by someone who has been appointed for that; in other words, not everybody can do it. The reason is that in Bali the wooden drum ‘kulkul’ is sacred. The action is done using a wooden tool locally referred to as ‘panggul’. The object is a wooden drum which is repeatedly hit, depending on what it is hit for. How the verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngukul</span><span class="font4"> is used is illustrated in the following sentences:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<p><span class="font4">i.</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nungting</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nungting</span><span class="font4"> is often uttered by a traditional leader when a religious ceremony is performed at the temple to ask what is referred to as ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">saya</span><span class="font4">’ (staff member of the traditional leader) to hit two wooden drums; one is hit after the other. The verb ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nunting</span><span class="font4">’ means causing a wooden drum to sound. However, the wooden drum which is hit is different from the one when the action of ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngukul</span><span class="font4">’ is hit. The type of the wooden drum hit when the action of ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nungting</span><span class="font4">’ is done is referred to as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kulkul pejenengan</span><span class="font4">. The way of doing the action of ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngukul</span><span class="font4">’ is similar to the way of doing the action of ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nunting</span><span class="font4">’; however, in the action of doing the action of ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nungting</span><span class="font4">’ there are two wooden drums which are hit; one is hit after the other. Apart from that, the action of ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nungting</span><span class="font4">’ is usually done when the God who is believed to reside at the temple is descended from where He is usually worshipped. The event for which the action of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nunting</span><span class="font4"> is done is usually more sacred that that for which the action of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngukul</span><span class="font4"> is done. Sentence (14) exemplifies how the verb ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nungting</span><span class="font4">’ is used.</span></p>

The subject is human and the object is a coconut of which the peel is already removed. One hand is used for holding the coconut and the other is used for hitting it in such a way that it gets broken. The action is done quickly and strongly. When what is hit is either a dog or a thief, this is also referred to as’ngeplokin’; however, the difference is that the object is either an animal or human. The tool is the same, namely a hammer but what is hit is the back part of the object.</span></p>

The object is the newly-harvested paddy to make it separated from the stalks. In the action of ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nepung</span><span class="font4">’ the tools used are also ‘lu’ and stone mortar. The object is the wet rice which is pounded to make flour. In the action of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngintuk</span><span class="font4">, the object is either meat or spices which are pounded until they become fine.

It can be seen that the object is much smaller than the subject. In so far as the parts of the human body are concerned, the action of ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">namplak</span><span class="font4">’ is not only uttered when someone hits his/her head, it is also uttered when someone hits his/her face, hands, feet, and shoulders. The action of ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nyemes</span><span class="font4">’ is only uttered in the volley ball game. It is a loan word from a foreign language which is often heard in the volley ball game. It is done using the palm of one hand and the volley ball is the object.

The verb ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">memukul</span><span class="font4">’ has two meanings; namely doing something and occurring. In the explanation below, the verbs are classified based on whether the actions expressed using the verbs employ tools or not.</span></p>

This can be explicated as follows: At the same time, X does something on Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a result, something occurs to Y, X does the action using a tool referred to as ‘panggul’; X does it repeatedly, causing X to be happy; Y sounds; X wants this, and X does this.</span></p>

Pounding something in the ‘lesung’ (mortar) using the ‘lu’ repeatedly is the way of doing the action, meaning that the action is done in an up-down motion. This can be explicated as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the same time, X does something on Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore, something occurs to Y; X does the action using tools referred to as ‘lu’ and ‘lesung’; X does it repeatedly in an up-down motion; X feels happy; X wants this; X does something like this.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The approach used is the MSA (Natural Semantic Metabahasa). In the analysis it is reflected that the MSA approach means completely every lexicon of the verb ‘hit’ with the technique of application even though each of the above lexicons has a very close relationship in one field of the same meaning which is ‘hit’.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5.</span><span class="font2">1 The form of one verb used to express the action ‘memukul’ (hit) in the Balinese language is different from that of another, depending on how the action is done, the tool used, and what the subject and object are.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meanings of the verbs used to express the action ‘memukul’ (hit) can be differentiated into two; they are doing something and occurring. The subject does something on the undergoer (the object), causing something to happen to the object.</span></p></li></ul></li><li>
