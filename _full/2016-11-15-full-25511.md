<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>I INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Theory of Semantic Natural Metalanguage is study of semantic. That theory assumes that every language has a set of meaning. The approach of this theory is semantic that able to explains the result of meaning. The most fundamental NSM concept is the concept of semantic primes, i.e. meanings which cannot be paraphrased in simpler terms: the bedrock of linguistic meaning. To the extent that semantic primes can be identified and match up across languages, they provide a stable and language-neutral metalanguage for lexical typology, at least on its semantic side; for mapping out patterns of polysemy, patterns of structuring in the lexicon, the general architecture of semantic domains and fields, for investigating lexicon-grammar interactions, and so on (Lehrer 1992; Koch 2001; Koptjevskaja-Tamm 2008). Beside that, the NSM claim is that a successful reductive paraphrase which satisfies native speaker intuitions and which predicts and/or explains natural usage (including entailments, implications, and so on) can be viewed as a conceptual model.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this study, the writer will focus on predicate of ‘ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Mangan’</span><span class="font4"> because </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Mangan</span><span class="font4"> is the basic meaning of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ngajengan, Daharan, Ngelor, Mangan, Ngrodok</span><span class="font4"> (Eating), </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kaken</span><span class="font4"> (Eating), </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Suap, Bejijit</span><span class="font4">, (Eating) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bekeruak</span><span class="font4"> (Eating), </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ngerasak</span><span class="font4"> (Eating) and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nyangklok</span><span class="font4"> (Eating). These words has different usage in writing and oral communication. On the other hand, these words also has different meaning based on subject and object. Example; predicate for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Raden, Tuan Guru,</span><span class="font4"> or wise and honorable Person used </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ngajengan</span><span class="font4"> to state that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Raden</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tuan Guru</span><span class="font4"> ate rice with good composition. While the words for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Daharan</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngelor</span><span class="font4"> to state eating rice for parent, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lalau</span><span class="font4">, and also for older people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Phenomenon of these words is very complicated because the predicate of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">eat</span><span class="font4"> in sasak language vary a lot and these words has different usage and meaning. In this study, the writer will take concern on these phenomenon and explanation as detail as possible about the meaning of words as basic meaning of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ngajengan, Daharan, Ngelor, Mangan, Ngrodok</span><span class="font4"> (Eating), </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kaken</span><span class="font4"> (Eating), </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Suap, Bejijit,</span><span class="font4"> (Eating) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bekeruak</span><span class="font4"> (Eating), </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ngerasak</span><span class="font4"> (Eating) and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nyangklok </span><span class="font4">(Eating).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>II MATERIALS AND METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Data source in this study is predicate of mangan in Sasak Language. Predicate of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Mangan</span><span class="font4"> has many variation, the writer told the words of culture because there are a lot of term in sasak. The data obtain from Sasak Dictionary that has been published in internet and dictionary. Besides that, to obtain validity of the data, the writer interview sasak people, in order to support data collection obtained from Sasak Dictionary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The method used in this study is analytical and interpretation. This method used was based on the data of this study. So the writer suppose that analytical and interpretation is appropriate to explain the data. For the theory used to analysis and interpret the data, the writer will use Natural Semantic Metalanguage.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>III &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">NSM semantics represents a style of conceptual analysis characteristic of philosophical rationalism in the tradition of Leibniz. Semantic analysis in NSM involves the reductive paraphrase of definienda into a metalanguage constituted by a subset of ordinary language expressions claimed to represent universal primitive concepts. The following is a list of the English words whose meanings are considered to be primitive:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">I, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, someone, people, something/thing, body; this, the same, other; one, two, some, all, much/many; good, bad; big, small; think, know, want, feel, see, hear; say, words, true; do, happen. move; there is, have; live, die; when/time, now, before, after a long time, a short time, for some time; where/place, here, above, below, far, near, side, inside; not, maybe, can, because, if; very, more; kind of, part of; like. (Goddard 2002: 14)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">NSM depends on the claim that each of these words can be translated without addition or loss of meaning into every language. Since the list could just as easily have been given in Malay or Mandarin, it is necessary to distinguish between each primitive meaning itself, represented by small capitals (e.g. GOOD), and the particular ‘exponent’ of the meaning in whatever language is in question (e.g. good in English, bon in French, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on explanation Goddrd 2002 in above, the writer will concern on doing of mangan in sasaknese language. To explain these meaning of mangan, the writer used the basic assumptions of Natural Semantic Metalanguage. To make clear what does it means by the writer about predicate </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mangan</span><span class="font4"> in Sasaknese language, it can be seen bellow:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3.1 &nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Ngajengan, Daharan, Ngelor, Mangan, Ngrodok (Eating)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ngajengan</span><span class="font4"> is verb in sasak language that state eating rice by sit wit the legs crossed and a lot of foods, snacks, and drinking. The difference between Ngajengan and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Daharan</span><span class="font4"> is person who eating such as parent, teacher, and people who suppose wise and honorable. It can be illustrate what differences among </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ngajengan, Daharan, Ngelor, Mangan, Ngrodok</span><span class="font4"> (Eating). If we contstruct to the formula of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ngajengan, Daharan, Ngelor, Mangan, Ngrodok</span><span class="font4">, it is explained below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If X use to state wise and honorable people</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If X use to state TGH and Raden</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If X use to state older people</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If X use to state common people; that people will ate</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If X use to state not polite people, that people will angry</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(3-1) Raden Engoh atau Tuang Guru sampun aturan Ngajengan lek taok sak sampun tesediaan isik panitia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Raden Engoh or Tuan Guru has eating in the place that have prepare by committee</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Papuk tuan sampun Daharan lek balengko</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Grandfather has eating in my house (3-2) kamu uah mangan you have eaten kamu uah ngerodok you have eaten</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example above give description predicate </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ngajengan</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Daharan</span><span class="font4"> in Sasak language that has different meaning. The reference of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">daharan</span><span class="font4"> is wise and honorable people. In other word, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ngelor</span><span class="font4"> is for common people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">From the explanation above, we can comprehend that predicate of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ngajengan, Daharan, Ngelor, Mangan, Ngrodok</span><span class="font4"> (Eating) has the same meaning but different usage in sentence. In other word, these predicates determine subject and object in every sentence. Descartes, Pascal, Arnauld, dan Leibniz (periksa Goddard 1994: 2, Wierzbicka 1996b: 12). Arnauld (1662/1964: 86—87 via Goddard 1994: 2), example, said that: “It is impossible to define all words. In defining we employ a definition to express the idea which we want to join to defined word; if we then wanted to defined 'the definition', still other words</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">would be needed—and so on to infinity. Hence, it is necessary to stop at some primitive words which are not defined.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Head meaning of ‘kaken’ and ‘suap’ is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mangan</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mangan</span><span class="font4"> is most familiar word in Sasak society. The word of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kaken</span><span class="font4"> in Sasak language refers to eat snacks or the other food not rice. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Suap</span><span class="font4"> is predicate to state eating, it refer to child eating rice and it do it by hand not spoon. Child eat while his or her mother say something so the child eat (suap). If we made formula of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kaken</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">suap</span><span class="font4"> it will look like these:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">X do it by hand and it can do it by standing, sitting or lay down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">X do it by hand and accompany by his or her mother</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(3-3) &nbsp;&nbsp;Andi kaken ambon</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Younger brother eat while his mother say cuap, cuap</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To illustrate what the differences between </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kaken</span><span class="font4"> and suap, the writer will show the picture. Word of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kaken</span><span class="font4"> in Sasak languge not refer to rice but snacks and not need accompanied by any people. It can be done by one person and more then one and it is not formal action and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kaken</span><span class="font4"> can be done by standing, siting, and lay down.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">From the explanation in above, the writer can comprehend the predicate form of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kaken</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">suap</span><span class="font4">, where </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kaken</span><span class="font4"> for eat snack and the other foods not eat rice. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Suap</span><span class="font4"> is the words of Sasak language that usually use for baby eat while his mother say something funny so the child want eat.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The word of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bejijit</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bekeruak</span><span class="font4"> has different usage in Sasak language. The predicate of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bejijit</span><span class="font4"> is refer to eat soybean etc. Sasak people do it by standing and set down also the predicate of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bejijit</span><span class="font4"> it can be mixed with rice. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bejijit</span><span class="font4"> usually done by himself while watching tv or enjoy good situation. It is different to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bekeruak</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bekeruak</span><span class="font4"> usually done together in one group that consist of five people and usually done when there is marriage ceremony. Besides that, for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bekeruak</span><span class="font4"> it must be meat or chicken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To elucidate the differences of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bejijit</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bekeruak</span><span class="font4">, the writer will show the picture of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bekerak</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bejijit</span><span class="font4">. Besides that, the writer will formulate of the meaning of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bekeruak</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bejijit</span><span class="font4">.
