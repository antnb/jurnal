<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark5"></a>I.</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction<sup>1</sup></span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Bali is a small island located in the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia. Bali has a lot of natural charm that is very beautiful and very interesting almost in all remote areas. Bali also has many regional arts that are well-known in all circles of society. Gianyar Regency is one of the 9 regencies in the Province of Bali that is rich in the diversity of arts, customs and culture that is still growing and sustainable to this day, so that the Kabupaen Gianyar Regency is known as the Arts District. Gianyar is an area of art, where in this area has various types of art which is a sacred and traditional dance and many standing art galleries whose numbers recorded to date in Gianyar Regency reached 233 pieces that are scattered in all districts. 23 studios are in Gianyar</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sub-district, 18 studios in Blahbatuh District, 60 studios in Sukawati Sub-district, 20 studios in Tegalalang District, 19 studios in Tampaksiring Sub-district, 76 studios in Ubud Sub-district, and 17 studios in Payangan sub-district [1].</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the period 1942 to 1961 routinely performed by the Barong Dance in the Pura Desa Singapadu which eventually became turmoil over the use of the Pura area as a place to perform the Barong Dance, the artists finally had to create a new staging place in Banjar Sengguan Singapadu. In line with the development of the Barong dance performance which is increasingly widespread and developing rapidly, the development of the stage for the staging in the Sukawati area also developed [2].</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The many interests of visitors come to Bali to watch the show, making a lot of the construction of the stage that functioned as a place to watch the show, although the stage used is fairly simple, but it does not dampen the interest of tourists to come see the show that was held. This</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">phenomenon is very interesting to be used as a research area with the title &quot;Open Stage Anyar in Gianyar&quot;. when it was still in the kingdom system of Gianyar Regency named Griya Anyar, which means Rumah Baru. It is hoped that from this title a magnificent performance venue will be created and does not contain the history of the city of Gianyar itself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyar Open Stage</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anyar</span><span class="font2"> Open Stage is a plan that will later be used as a container or place to accommodate various types of arts and performance activities. By seeing the number of tourists visiting Gianyar, especially to Sukawati and Ubud Districts, it is hoped that the (new) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anyar</span><span class="font2"> Open Stage planning in Gianyar is intended to realize or revive the interest of tourists to come back to Gianyar Regency to enjoy various types of performances , not only barong performances, but a variety of classical and modern shows with a magnificent container or venue, without forgetting the history of the stage development in Gianyar Regency while enjoying visitors' performances are also presented with enchanting natural scenery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The location chosen for the construction of the Open Stage is in the Regency of Gianyar, precisely in Kemenuh Village, Sukawati District, Gianyar, this location was chosen because according to the zonazi distribution the Gianyar Sukawati Regency is a center zone for art trade or art development. So when viewed from the zoning area is very appropriate considering the number of Open Stage supporting objects around it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design Criteria</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Design criteria are a reference in designing. Design criteria as a solution to the problems in the design are then used as design directions that have the results of statements where the statement contains the desired performance. The design criteria include four main things, which are to consider form, function, economy and time. Design criteria aim to determine the description of the desired final design and according to consideration of these four things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the application of design criteria on the appearance of the building by applying elements of Balinese Architecture in the form of the application of Balinese carving ornaments, the Tri Mandala element as a determinant of spatial zones, Asta Kosala Kosali as a determinant of the location of the entrance and the Tri Angga Concept which requires that the final result of the building have elements of head, body and the feet. The architectural elements are the main building constituents which consist of the facade and inner space. The facade is a part of the building that faces the road directly. According to Harimu, the building facade is divided into three main compilers, namely the foot of the building, the building body and the head of the building. For more details, consider the following figures 1 and 2.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/58333-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:253pt;height:113pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 1. Detail Drawing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Balinese carvings and ornaments are applied comprehensively in this Open Stage building, can be seen from the entrance to the site, the wall around the site, and of course in all the main buildings and supporting buildings. For more details, consider the following picture 2.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/58333-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:241pt;height:91pt;">

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spatial Design</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The division of space in Anyar's Open Stage uses the arrangement with elements of the Tri Mandala concept as an indication of the application of Balinese Architecture. The Tri Mandala concept includes the spatial layout of Mandala, Madya Mandala and Utama Mandala. The division of the following rooms is based on activity and site noise analysis. Areas in red are high-noise zones and are public areas. The area in yellow is a noisy zone with a low category as a semipublic area and the area in green is a quiet zone as a private area and as an area for main functions ( Figure 3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So, the element of Nista Mandala is located from the main entrance to the vehicle parking area, then the Madala Mandala element is from the drop off area and the park serves as an open space and the main element of Mandala is entering buildings.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/58333-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:240pt;height:165pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 3. Interior Concept</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/58333-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:252pt;height:182pt;">

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design Final</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The Open Stage building facade is dominated by the application of red brick and face material. The facade is a part of the building that usually faces the road to access the building. According to Suparno to add aesthetics in designing building facades, facade articulation needs to be added. Articulation of the facade can be created with</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">different facade compositions through a different form or material. The building in Figure 5 is the main building where the building body is dominated by sand and red brick material. The use of red brick material and sand on the building body aims to display local local wisdom and give a natural impression that is in harmony with the surrounding environment. The head of the building (roof) uses alang-alang roof coverings and the foot of the building uses natural stone. Both of these materials can create a more natural atmosphere when combined.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/58333-5.jpg" alt="" style="width:244pt;height:163pt;">
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 5. Perspective</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Viewed from the entrance to the site, this building is very thick with culture and impression of Balinese architecture combined with modern architecture, where the application of Balinese Architecture from the finishing element can be seen in all buildings, the use of bricks and faces is very highlighted to add to the classic atmosphere of the building alone. Similarly, the area on the stage that is made majestic with 3 grand kori with different sizes.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/58333-6.jpg" alt="" style="width:240pt;height:139pt;">
