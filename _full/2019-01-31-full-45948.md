<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract—</span><span class="font4">The earlier research on critical ecolinguistics tended to criticize the negative impacts of language in encouraging ecologically destructive behavior. However, this present study acts differently, it focusses on analysing positive impacts of language in preserving the environment. This present study aims at analysing the interpretation of ecological preservation revealed in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font4"> (customary law) text belonging to Tenganan Pegringsingan Village. The data of the research were taken from lexical items, phrases, clauses or sentences used in the written text of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font4">. The collected data were analysed using Positive Discourse Analysis (PDA) developed by Stibbe (2017). The findings of the present study showed that the interpretation of ecological preservation in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font4"> text took the form of preservation of natural ecology, preservation of human ecology, and preservation of spiritual ecology. The three findings above correspond to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Hita Karana (THK)</span><span class="font4"> concept which was considered the ecosophy (philosophy of ecological harmony) of the study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The parameter of ecolinguistics, particularly the existence of languages is indeed to be present among humans, interdependent, interacting, and interrelated with everything in its environment to make ecolinguistics “life science” (Genua, 2018: 54-55). Thus, the presence of ecolinguistics study aims at dissecting stories revealed in human daily life. The stories can be revealed from various sources, either in written, oral, or visual forms. Early ecolinguistics approaches tended to focus on how grammatical features and lexical items built into the language system prevent ecological thinking (Stibbe, 2017: 499). Halliday in Stibbe, (2017: 499) states that there is a problem occurring with a language system approach, namely it fails to consider how particular ways to further its interest, and there is little prospect of changing the language system itself. Stibbe (2017: 499) further states that this problem encouraged the occurrence of new approaches that have tended to focus on discourses rather than on the language system. A discourse approach examines how a particular group in society selects particular</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">lexical items and grammatical structures from those available from the linguage system, and combine particular ways to tell the stories about the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Previously, critical ecologuistics mostly focused on the negative impacts of language on encouraging ecologically destructive behavior; however, positive impacts of language in preserving the environment is lately also considered by linguists, telling the stories about texts or discourses that need to be promoted for their beneficial values to the sustainability of the ecosystem which life depends on. There are numorous of positive discourses surrounding human life that need to be spread out instead of criticizing the destructive ones. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Hita Karana (THK)</span><span class="font4"> philosophy, for example, is one of the texts that is considered encouraging people in Bali to preserve the environment in terms of spiritual, social, and natural environments. The main goal of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">THK</span><span class="font4"> is to create the human happiness and prosperity that can be achieved through harmonious relationships between man and the Almighty God, his fellowbeings, and nature (cf. Wiana, 2007:5-6; Peters and W. Wardana, 2013:52; Yudari, 2015: 60).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The implementation of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">THK</span><span class="font4"> concept can be implicitly seen from the sustainability of Tenganan Pegringsingan Village in preserving the existence of the environment that was inherited by the ancestors of the villagers. One effort towards ecological preservation carried out by the community was to pour the idea into the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font4"> they belong to. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awig-awig</span><span class="font4"> is a form of written customary law that contains a set of rules as guidelines for behaving in society and accompanied by sanctions that are firmly carried out (Dharmika, 1992). The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font4"> belonging to Tenganan Pegringsingan Village reveals the meanings of ecological preservation conveyed by the text producers to the people who are the members of the customary village. In essence, the people of Tenganan Village are aware of the importance of interaction, interrelation and their interdependence with the environment as a place for the survival of their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This present study aims at analyzing the interpretation of ecological preservation of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig </span><span class="font4">belonging to Tenganan Pegringsingan village from PDA perspective developed by Arran Stibbe. According to Stibbe (2017), PDA is a search for new ways of using language that tell very different stories from those of the current industrial civilization – stories that can encourage us to protect the ecosystem that life depends on and build more socially just societies. New stories are needed to provide alternatives to current stories of consumerism, technological progress, economic growth, the mastery of nature and other dominant ways of conceiving the world that contribute to ecological destruction.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">This study applied a qualitative method. Data collection method used was the documentation method. The data taken in this study were in the forms of lexical items, grammatical constructions, and other linguistic features used in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font4"> text belonging to Tenganan Pegringingan Village which are related to the preservation of ecology. Furthermore, these data were analyzed using PDA developed by Stibbe (2017).</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Nature is seen as valuable to itself, because there is life in it, by itself human beings are seen as an inseparable part of nature and depend entirely on nature (Keraf, 2014: 89). Human relations to the natural environment are considered to be static or unchanging. Natural/ environmental containers and contents, some of which are seen and those that are considered invisible. Containers with all-natural contents that appear to be the universe with all its elements, such as: planet earth, sun moon, and animals. The content element of planet Earth consists of natural biota, both biotic and abiotic. The biotic natural elements are in the form of biological components, such as groups of humans, animals, and plant groups. While the abiotic natural elements consist of: soil, solar energy, air, atmosphere, water, temperature, etc. (Maria and I Wayan Rupa, 2007: 96). There are no living organisms isolated from other living organisms. There is a chain of life that supports and sustains each other's life and life as a whole. This reaffirms the importance of patterns, linkages, interactions, mutual influence, and mutual support as being the core of the systemic paradigm (Keraf, 2014: 107).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The existence of the natural environment has a very important role for the people of Tenganan Pegringsingan Village. This can be seen from the lives of the people who are very familiar with the natural environment with all its contents. The familiarity of the community with the natural environment yields a local wisdom that aims at making the people of Tenganan Pegringsingan Village maintain and care for the environment because life is very dependent on the existence of it. The preservation of the natural environment becomes not only a source of life for the people, but also becomes a buffer for the erosion of language and culture that has been inherited from generation to generation. Ideas for the maintenance and care of the environment in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font4"> can be examined from the following citations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In citation (1), the text producers forbid the people of the Tenganan Pegringsingan Village to sell land of inheritance in the form of gardens, rice fields or home yards.

Implicitly, the ban on pawning or selling this land is intended so that the people of Tenganan Pegringsingan Village still maintain the existence of the village environment in order to remain as inherited by their ancestors. The use and the allocation of the inherited land must be handed down to their grandchildren by obeying the contents of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font4"> which is considered a local wisdom of the community.

<p><span class="font4">The phrase </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">angeker wit kayu</span><span class="font4"> &quot;growing trees&quot; in citation (6) is an affirmation of the text producers that the conditions of the natural environment demand that the people of Tenganan Pegringsingan Village adapt to their survival. The growth of trees in the local village area characterized the sensitivity of the people to maintain, care for, and preserve the existence of timber trees protected by the village. The trees protected by the village are prohibited from being cut down as long as they live, except with the permission of the village by considering the condition of the tree, or the possibility of living a tree is very small. And the felled timber tree can be used to make or repair houses with permission from the village. Whereas, if the allocation is for the benefit of village facilities, logging of surviving timber trees is permitted by the village observations and decisions. Logging is usually done by prioritizing trees that have a distance that is too close to each other, which is usually measured by calculating a certain distance that becomes a village agreement. For trees that produce fruit, both private property of residents and village property, are not allowed to pick the fruit directly from the trees. Fruit can be taken and enjoyed, if it has fallen itself from the tree. In this case, the value of human respect for plant rights is found to carry out natural life processes. The importance of the existence of trees for the Tenganan Pegringsingan community, so as to protect the forest area which is the source of the springs of life for the people, becomes a very important substance to be included in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">awig-awig</span><span class="font4">.
