<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ABSTRAK</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kata kunci</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">: budaya perusahaan, era disrupsi, kesenjangan generasi</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PRELIMINARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Era of Disruption has penetrated all aspects of world life and has significantly changed civilization and society. One of the biggest challenges in the era of disruption is that a person must have a variety of skills that must be mastered due to increasingly rapid technological developments. An era in which there is a fusion of technology that results in physical, biological, and digital dimensions being difficult to distinguish (Schawab, 2016). Fundamental changes are taking place due to massive changes in society in the field of technology in every aspect of life. The large size of the company cannot be a guarantee of success, but the agility of the company is the key to success for achieving achievements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Disruption is an innovation, but an innovation that is very progressive because it will replace the entire old system in new ways. This disruption not only changes the business, but its business fundamentals (Suwardana, 2018). For this reason, the motivation to carry out change management is not enough, but presenting sustainable innovation has become the main obligation for anyone (any organization) if they want to survive in today's era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Disruption has penetrated all sides of the world's life, especially in corporate culture. So that the shift in order in society is starting to recognize the internet of things, giving rise to new innovations that shift the old ways that are less effective and efficient through technology that continues to develop (Putra, 2018). For companies, culture is a very important thing because of its ability to direct the behavior of company employees to the desired goals and culture needs to always be adapted to the development of every era (Nawawi, 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Corporate culture is a form of management philosophy, which refers to how to manage a company in an effort to increase effectiveness, on the other hand corporate culture should be built and maintained (Robbins, P. Stephen &amp;&nbsp;Judge, 2017). The culture owned by the company has values and norms that become the basis for acting by an employee in the company, this is what is used as a strategy to be able to implement it in the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Corporate culture is very capable of influencing the thoughts, feelings, interactions, and performance of employees in a company, a thorough understanding of the importance of corporate culture is very important in managing employees in a company, especially in fostering higher levels (Ahiabor, 2014) and (Ghanavati, 2014). 2014). Corporate culture does not appear by itself among companies, but corporate culture needs to be formed and studied because basically in corporate culture there is a set of values and behavior patterns that are learned in every employee of the company and passed down from generation to generation. On the other hand, corporate culture can play a role in creating and developing a company, one of which is by providing work behavior guidelines for employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The era of disruption that damaged the corporate culture also had an impact on the gaps that existed in the company's employees. Regulatory mechanisms and concepts are intangible, individuals are united into a social structure and can be used by company leaders to support strategic change and influence employees (Hofstetter, H., &amp;&nbsp;Harpaz, 2015). The generation gap is a trigger for unrest among managers. With a generation gap like this, companies need to have a human capital policy that focuses on the gap between generations, so that workers will eventually have emotional attachments and show greater enthusiasm to work for individual and organizational success (Ozcelik, 2015). It is feared, this generation gap will lead to friction between employees, and will jeopardize the overall teamwork in a company (Starks, 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are several generations including the baby boomer generation, gen X, Y and Z and millennials. Considering that this era of disruption is very influential on corporate culture and causes gaps in employees, researchers are interested in researching PT. PLN (Persero)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bali Distribution. PT. PLN (Persero) Bali Distribution, which is expanding its business at a global level, must develop a strategy on cross-cultural analysis of the company based on competitive intelligence tools and resources, and can address the generation gap between employees in this era of disruption.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Seen from the table above that there are various ages found in PT. PLN Bali Distribution. In this case, Generation X and Y are more dominant than Generation Z and Millennials. The era of a new civilization occurs because of advances in existing technology. Because the impact of disruption causes alienation of culture and there is a generation gap due to the era of disruption that cannot be avoided. Significant differences related to the gap between generations can be seen from work values, work attitudes and work expectations, but because national culture has an important role in determining community values, and these values are considered to be translated into the workplace (Hui-chun, Y. &amp;&nbsp;Miller, 2003).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another Generational Gaps from (Walters, 2016) states that regardless of their generational stereotypes, workers from several age group categories consider their work motivation to be when they do impactful and meaningful work. The previous research used as the main reference is research by (Alexandru, C., Rym, 2011) about emphasizing significant gaps, and complex analysis of profiles of different cultures and work styles. In previous research by (Campa, Pamela; Casarico, Alessandra; Profeta, 2009) which stated that changing attitudes and values may be a difficult process, which also depends on the local context. second, the demand side also plays an important role in determining the local cultural environment. It is important to look at this issue from the side of the gap that arises due to the lack of understanding of the existence of this generation (Anantatmula, V. S., &amp;&nbsp;Shrivastav, 2012).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The gaps in this research are very clear between generations. PT. PLN (Persero) Bali Distribution, which is expanding its business at a global level, must develop a strategy on cross-cultural analysis of the company based on competitive intelligence tools and resources, and can address the generation gap between employees.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>RESEARCH METHODS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">This study uses a qualitative research method based on the philosophy of postpositivism (Sugiyono, 2014). Research using this qualitative method is carried out on natural objects, which develop as they are, and are not manipulated by researchers. So that researchers can research about corporate culture and the gap between generations in the era of disruption without any manipulation of the results of interviews, data analysis is inductive based on the facts found in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Determining the location of the research needs to consider substantive theory, explore the field and look for conformity with the reality in the field. Meanwhile, geographical and practical limitations such as time, cost, labor need to be taken into consideration in determining the location of the study (Moleong, 2014). So the location taken in this study was determined purposively at PT PLN Distribution Bali. PT. PLN Bali Distribution is a company whose business expansion at the global level must develop a strategy based on cross-cultural analysis of the company based on competitive intelligence tools and resources, and can address the generation gap between employees in this era of disruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Informants in this study were selected from employees who have high positions, who have implemented strategies within the scope of corporate culture and faced generational gaps. Interviews were conducted to obtain exposure from informants regarding the extent to which the corporate culture of PT. PLN plays a role in the Era of Disruption? and how does PT. PLN respond to the generation gap between employees in the Era of Disruption? For this reason, research informants are 1 manager of UPT PT. PLN Distribution, 6 section managers and 9 section supervisors, interviews with informants were carried out directly at PT PLN Distribution Bali, to get interviews with informants it took 4 weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Data analysis techniques in qualitative research are carried out before entering the field, while in the field, and after finishing in the field (Sugiyono, 2014). Analysis techniques include field preparation, conducting research in the field, then reducing data, displaying data, and verifying data by returning to the field to discuss the findings with informants. This last stage is called a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">member</span><span class="font7"> check. Through this stage, several themes related to research questions were obtained, namely challenges in the era of disruption, strengthening corporate culture, and sustainable strategies. The results section will describe dealing with each theme and how it relates to the sub themes. For example, in the challenges of the era of disruption, there are sub-themes of external and internal challenges. The theme of corporate culture will explain in detail the description of corporate culture and how strengthening corporate culture is used to answer challenges. Likewise, in the explanation related to the strategy, the practical strategy that has been carried out by PLN will be discussed, both aimed at facing external and internal challenges. At the end will disajik 's scheme of research results to sift fish are katan between challenges, corporate culture and strategy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Challenges in the era of disruption</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">Disruption not only meaningful change phenomenon today </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(today change)</span><span class="font7">, but also reflects the changes meaning ice ok </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(the future change)</span><span class="font7"> (Kasali, 2017)</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font7"> Perusahaa n disruptive many merubahkan the ste m are valid until eventually could lead to the occurrence of a fundamental change that should not be overlooked. The era of disruption is a situation in which the industrial world or work competition drives the process of a digitalization system (Yahya, 2018). This means that the higher the company is not released from the threat or disruption of the challenge itself when companies do not make changes da n Melak ukan adjustments at Zama disruption era. The symptoms of disruption do not know whether the industry is big or small, but attack all industries that are not ready to face it. Not easy to face disruption, for those who want to survive they aka n mengh adapi fight outside world and perform a variety of innovations, but if it is not ready they hany a will compete with each</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">other on their own. The challenges faced by the PT. PLN Distribution company are on two sides including external challenges and internal challenges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">External challenge</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">PT PLN Distribution is a state-owned enterprise that distributes power lines for the public interest. In the midst of an increasingly rapidly changing world, PT. PLN is required to always be in front, one step ahead, both in terms of technology development, service quality and commitment to sustainable business model development. According to the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT)., 2016) that the problems of the energy sector in Indonesia today can be summarized briefly, namely the decreasing electrical energy reserves and public access to energy which is still limited, especially in disadvantaged, remote areas, and borders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">We all know, Indones he emergency energy should be a reason for Indonesia to change the mindset, that Indonesia has not become a producer is a surplus. The current pattern of energy consumption in the world, as well as in Indonesia, is still dominated by fossil energy in the form of oil, gas and coal. This is clearly a challenge that has the potential to become a threat in the energy sector, which requires serious handling. (Rohmat,Manager 40<sup>th</sup>)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">External challenges that are a challenge for PT. PLN, namely the entry of IPP (Independent Power Producers) or private power plants that have implemented EBT (New Renewable Energy) where environmentally friendly power plants will be operated as a top priority in order to reduce BPP (Basic Production Materials), while power plants belonging to PT. Many PLN still use fossil fuels (fossil) which is no longer relevant which makes BPP high, so that most of PLN's power plants are backup generators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Dependence on fossil energy, which is depleting its reserves, will plunge Indonesia into an energy crisis and become the main reason that NRE is closely related to environmental problems. (Marsudi,Manager 40th)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Symptoms of disruption in the electricity sector are the uneven distribution of time, the peak load is still a task for PT PLN that must be completed. This is a challenge for PT. PLN to continue to synergize in distributing electricity which is still limited, especially in disadvantaged, remote, and border areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Electricity is currently not evenly distributed to several remote and border areas, so it is our task to solve it in this era of disruption. (Adelia, SPV 29 <sup>th</sup> )</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So it can be concluded that there are three external challenges faced by PLN, namely the availability of energy reserves, competition with more advanced technology, and equitable distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Internal Challenge</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Along with applications in the era of disruption in a number of sectors of indust ri are ready, then the PT. PLN has also begun to adjust through the massive use of sensor technology, intelligent resource management, including intensive big data processing. PLN urge people especially the millennial and and mer eka yan g youthful to install PLN </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mobile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">In the face of changing times, I will continue to support activities that innovate by digitizing all business processes and operations, one of which is by developing the PL N Mobil e application that makes it easier for customers to enjoy PLN services. The power to transform already exists within PLN personnel. Dare to accept challenges. That's what will drive PLN's transformation (Yulianto, Manager 42<sup>th</sup>)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">PT. PLN Distribution continues to prepare for the era of disruption, one of which is strengthening Human Resources (HR). In this case, the internal challenges experienced by PT. PLN Distribution are that there are still human resources aged over 40 who are less able to run applications that support the smooth implementation of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Some people I noticed, especially those aged 40 years and over, they are a little difficult to apply the gadgets that are currently being used, which in fact this application is very easy to carry out work in companies (Dian, SPV 33<sup>th</sup>)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The internal challenges faced are broadly in the form of human resource capabilities dealing with technology. In addition, HR management and adapting the approach to the younger generation are important for companies to adapt to changes.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Corporate culture strengthening</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">Corporate culture is an important role holder in achieving company targets. The new culture developed by the company has been established by PT PLN Distribution Bali through a code of conduct explaining how the relationship should occur between superiors and subordinates, subordinates to superiors and also relationships with colleagues. By remaining in accordance with the (code of conduct) PT. PLN transformed, entitled Power Beyond Generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Through the launch of the PLN Transformation which remains in accordance with the guidelines and titled &quot;Power Beyond Generations&quot; PLN continues to move forward by carrying out transformations to prepare for electricity needs. PLN wants to make electricity available to all parties and contribute greatly to people's lives. PLN starts from using green energy as a future generator which is getting cheaper over time. (Rohmat, Manager 40<sup>th</sup>)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">PT. PLN started the transformation step by using green energy, the power to transform already exists in PT. PLN Distribution's people to conquer this era of disruption. Not only in the culture, but also in uniting the character and even the mindset between employees which can lead to mindset gaps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">From me personally, regarding the gap that exists in generations in the company, it is a challenge for me personally, where this is a very different perspective and mindset between generations. With that, we at this company usually hold regular weekly meetings such as weekly evaluations which we call COC. (Marsudi, Manager 40<sup>th</sup>)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So it is to keep PT. PLN in upholding a system (SIPP) including mutual trust where members of the organization respect and have good intentions towards the company. Integrity members of the organization are required to be honest and have</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">commitment. Caring where a member of the organization has a sense of caring for other members of the organization, and Learners</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">PLN HR puts forward the SIPP culture (mutual trust, integrity, care, and learning). A culture of mutual trust, a culture that always prioritizes positive behavior. Culture Integrity is a culture that maintains commitment to work. B udaya p eduli motivate each other in their work. A learning culture is a learning culture. (Ayu, Manager 39<sup>th</sup>)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">PT. PLN Distirbusi often holds regular weekly meetings, we usually call it a COC meeting. In this COC discussed assess pr ogres ker ja sebe lumnya and plan the work we will do next week. For example, what we did last week we discussed what the progress was like and what had not been achieved we had to do it by looking for a joint solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">COC is an activity that is carried out regularly and has become a corporate culture to convey direction, inspiration, discussions from the leadership to all employee members at PLN Distribution. With this COC, it is expected that PLN employees / personnel can understand and implement the Vision, Mission, Company Goals, Corporate Values, Relations between PLN Personnel, PLN Leadership, Corporate Attitudes </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">towards</span><span class="font7"> External Relations, GCG </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Go od Corporate Governance).</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Sustainable strategy</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">This global challenge is not a threat but an opportunity for PLN to continue to adapt by implementing various sustainability strategies, both external and internal to the company. This aims to realize world-class PLN services, able to adapt to changes, and at the same time make a positive contribution to the progress of the region and its community in the operational area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">External strategy</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving the quality of services and products</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Namely by developing the quality of services and products, improving the competence of human resources, as well as other important aspects in order to realize world-class service, which of course affects sustainability performance. And carry out various sustainability strategies in the environmental and social fields of society through various sustainability programs that are in accordance with the needs and adapt to the challenges of the times.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain environmental quality in operational areas</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">The company's human resources need to minimize the impact of operational activities and improve the quality of the environment in the operational area as well as make a positive contribution to the progress of the region and its community in the operational area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Internal strategy</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">a. Improving HR Competence</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Human resources have an important role in a company, through the potential of every employee of the company, they can achieve success in achieving the goals that have been set. Thus, human resources are said to be a determining factor for the success of a company. But on the other hand, the human resources owned by the company remain in synergy to keep paying attention to every customer of the company. Basically every customer would</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">want to get good service from PT. PLN. In this era of disruption, it is very demanding for companies to improve professional services in accordance with their respective fields. Where at this time the development of technology is very influential on the increasing need that is able to provide services easily and quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I know very well that technology is at the heart of all PT. PLN customer activities, therefore to address this the company issued the PLN Mobile application to make it easier for customers to get information about PLN. (Teguh, SPV 29<sup>th</sup>)</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The era of disruption presents challenges for companies, both externally and internally. Externally new competitors emerge and sometimes they are much more efficient and effective with new technologies that change the business landscape. Old players certainly have to rethink how to brew and implement new strategies in this era of disruption. With the rapid change in the line of life to become completely digital, it is not impossible that robots will replace human work. And change the mindset and have the awareness to be faster in adapting to change. All employees in the organization must quickly adapt to changes, because the effects of disruption can change everything, including organizational culture in carrying out company processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the other hand, corporate culture plays an important role and is required to synergize with strategy. This research provides a theoretical contribution on how companies maintain corporate culture in the era of disruption and this strategy is presented to answer external and internal challenges. Especially with regard to the gap between generations of employees. With a clear understanding, that the culture of the company can be developed and able to answer the challenges that exist, the gap between generations can be suppressed because each employee, though different generations have the same vision, namely to corporate promote.</span></p>
