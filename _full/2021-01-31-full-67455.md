</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">This study aims at finding an English learning model using an ecolinguistic approach in the preparation of syllabus and teaching materials. Qualitative descriptive methods are applied and natural phenomena are used to develop syllabus. This phenomenon focuses on learning and teaching strategies that are applied. Data obtained through tests, questionnaires and direct observation for needs analysis. The syllabus was developed based on the results of material analysis and needs.The ecological approach in education has the aim to preserve nature and its contents by building an environmentally friendly character. From this rationale, the ecological approach in language education has a number of characters that are used to find new ways to be applied to language learning. The result of the study shows that teaching materials have met the characteristics of the ecolinguistic approach, namely: relations, context, patterns / systems, emergence, quality, value, critical, variability, diversity, and activity. These characteristics are used as a theoretical basis for this research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">biological, social and cultural confusion. It is very important to apply the local cultural ecology system in the preparation of the English syllabus in higher institutions by incorporating local cultural elements into teaching materials. The ecolinguistic approach in this research can be used as environment-based language learning aimed at preventing language extinction. For example, the topic of a brand which is one of the topics in the development of teaching materials, the reading illustrates how students know the definition of a brand- symbols, designs, or signs that symbolize the value of a product, the importance of a brand or brand, how to create a brand and an example in real life that includes the figure of Ni Luh Djelantik, a businessman from Bali as well as a designer of handmade leather shoes from Bali with a brand of Ni Luh Djelantik shoes. This topic will make the students easier to understand readings because the content of the readings already refers to the ecological conditions around students. Critical ways of thinking of students to understand and relate the content of reading to the real conditions of students will be seen in this activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This research offers English teaching materials for Business Purposes (English for Business) in tertiary institutions. This English course is specifically designed to develop adequate knowledge for students to read. The students are also guided to practice using vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, dictation, emphasis, and intonation patterns that are acceptable and right. The purpose of this research is to develop English teaching material as a subject for personality development in tertiary institutions with an ecolinguistic approach. This study aims to find an English learning model using an ecolinguistic approach in the preparation of syllabi and teaching materials. Ecolinguistic approach is a new method used to arrange learning activities and language teaching based on linguistic ecology that has certain characteristics. This approach combines ecological systems and language systems, both of which have a very close relationship, ie language contains a very close relationship with the biological, social and cultural environment. Ecolingustic is the study of the interaction of language and environment. Language and environment are two things like the sides of the coin that are inseparable from the environment used by the speakers. In relation to the world of education, an ecolinguistic approach is a new method used to organize learning and teaching activities based on linguistic ecology that has certain characteristics. This approach combines ecological systems and language systems, both of which have a very close relationship, ie language contains a very close relationship with biological, social, and cultural confusion.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">This research is a descriptive qualitative research and uses inductive analysis of the phenomena that occur. The phenomenon that occurs focuses on the planning, process and results of learning English in university. This phenomenological research procedure requires the researcher to examine a number of subjects by being directly involved in developing patterns and relationships of meaning that occur (Cresswell, 2010). The researcher conducted material analysis, need analysis, designing syllabus, and compiling teaching materials and documents related to learning English in university. Data obtained directly from the initial tests, observations, and documents related to English learning for university level. All data were analyzed qualitatively namely data reduction, data presentation and drawing conclusions/verification (Miles, 1992).</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">The composition of teaching materials is a description of the learning situation and learning process. The following which will be discussed is the model of the composition of teaching materials which is the realization of an ecolinguistic syllabus arrangement. The selection of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">lingual teaching materials is included in the syllabus, which consist of the lingual form of grammatical units and lexical units.The language unit can be words, phrases, or sentences. In developing teaching materials, the content, skills and values in teaching materials are selected and sorted according to the context of the particular situation and the systemic functions of the language used. In the composition of teaching materials, there is also a relationship between one element with another element. The composition of teaching materials is arranged based on the characteristics of the ecolinguistic approach, namely relations, context, patterns / systems, emergence, quality, value, critical, variability, diversity, and activity (van Lier; 2004, 2010). Lingual content reflects the character of context, values, and language systems that have a relationship to the knowledge and the experience that the students have had. The flow of teaching materials contains language activities to encourage students to think critically, to have activities, and to quickly respond to students with the quality of learning outcomes provided. While, the way of learning and student learning outcomes show the variablity, diversity, and quality in accordance with the language production produced. Therefore the content and flow of learning activities are integrated in the composition of teaching materials</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The results of the arrangement of teaching materials above have been revised based on inputs of experts namely content, design and language experts. Experts in content and design of teaching materials provide assessments, opinions, and suggestions on the content and aspects of the appearance / layout of teaching materials. Whereas linguists provide assessments, opinions and suggestions on the linguistic aspects of teaching materials. The teaching material above applied an ecolinguistic approach that includes language skills, language components, and soft skills. The emphasized language skills are reading skills which include micro, macro and subskill reading skills as follows:</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">Figure 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning Objectives</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Micro reading skills developed in teaching materials such as distinguishing between typical graphemes and English orthographic patterns; recognising cohesive devices in written discourse and their role in signifying the relationship between clauses; recognizing the essence of words, and interpret patterns or sequences of words and their meanings systematically; recognising grammatical word classes and systems and the process of writing at an efficient speed according</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">to their purpose. Then the macro skill in reading is to detect specific cultural references and interpret them in the context of an appropriate cultural scheme; to deduce the relationship between events, cause and effect, and to detect relationships such as main ideas, supporting ideas, new information, known information, generalizing, and setting examples and to develop and use reading strategies such as scanning and skimming, detecting discourse markers, guessing the meaning of words from context, and activate schemata to interpret texts. The contents and flow of micro, macro and subskill reading activities are in accordance with the characteristics of the ecolingusitic approach (van Lier, 2004: 2010), namely variability and patterns / systems. In addition to reading skills, teaching materials also contain writing skills. The emphasized language components are vocabulary. Learning activities here are arranged in a text that blends with the biological environment, social and ideology of students. While soft skills include some skills such as listening, creative and critical thinking, presenting ideas, building teams and other abilities related to the capacity of individual personalities. The purpose of soft skills training is to provide opportunities for individuals to learn new behaviors and improve interpersonal relationships with others. In the world of work later, mastery of qualified soft skills ensures a productive, collaborative and healthy work environment, all important attributes for organizations in an increasingly competitive world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The design of teaching materials begins with the learning objectives for each unit. As shown in Figure 1. Then proceed with a few questions to stimulate students. This activity is called brainstorming. Brainstorming is used to initiate the process of thinking quickly and easily. Students are more creative and active in developing concepts, ideas or even facts that are relevant to the topic being discussed. Brainstorming activities can increase the flow of ideas spontaneously, imaginatively, creatively and flexibly. Brainstorming activities make the learning atmosphere more relaxed, thereby stimulating students to think, express ideas and feelings. The content and flow of activities are in accordance with the characteristics of the ecolingusitic approach (van Lier, 2004: 2010), namely emergence. Ecological linguistics sees language learning done not in stages or linearly, but rather in the use of language in an immediate action (emergence). The whole system is not just an arrangement of languages, but an emphasis on natural situations where each learner difference is seen as a difference in the scale, meaning and function of the overall knowledge possessed. Thinking quickly (emergence) can be seen in the picture below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">BEFORE YOU READ</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You are going to read the text about brand. First, answer the following questions:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are brand names important?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name three different sources of brand names!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What brands do you like or follow on social media and why?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever think about developing a business? What brand do you want to have?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">Figure 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activity before reading</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">At this stage &quot;before you read&quot;, students will be asked to observe and associate with things that students know and activate prior knowledge, especially related to brand topics, namely what is the importance of brand for students, brand names that students know, brand names that students like and follow on social media and plan to develop your own student brand. The flow of activities has the meaning of interrelated processes between one flow to another flow. Before</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">reading, students are invited to make predictions about the reading title and then determine the appropriate adjective to describe the reading title as illustrated below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Look at the title below. Then check (∕) if you think these adjective describe the title</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1.</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(</span><span class="font6"> ) Famous</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font6">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(_) Amazing</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">Figure 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing adjectives according to the title of the reading</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">The next flow is the activity of understanding the reading entitled &quot;You are Your Brand&quot;. The reading illustrates how students know the definition of a brand or brand, symbol, design, or sign that symbolizes the value of a product, the importance of a brand or brand, how to create a brand and an example in real life that includes the figure of Ni Luh Djelantik, an entrepreneur from Bali as well as adeisgner of leather handmade shoes from Bali with Ni Luh Djelantik brand or brand shoes. It will make easier for the students to understand readings because the content of the readings already refers to the ecological conditions around students. Critical ways of thinking of students to understand and relate the content of reading to the real conditions of students will be seen in this activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After the reading activity is done, the next flow is to look for words / phrases related to the business. Followed by the formation of groups of 3-4 people to being together to understand the contents of the reading. To measure students' ability in understanding, students are asked to work on questions such as examples of choosing the correct statement in accordance with the contents of the reading and immediately showing evidence and answering reading comprehension questions. In reading comprehension questions, some questions require students to think critically. Teaching and learning strategies using critical thinking skills are carried out to achieve more meaningful goals. Course learning design should provide opportunities for students to think critically, especially in reading. Various understanding exercises in reading skills have varied learning outcomes as follows</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The vocabulary contained in the reading has shown the biological and social dimensions that are in accordance with the ecolinguistic concept. Lingual is arranged in verbal text on the main teaching material according to the skills and learning activities provided. After the understanding activity, students were asked to look for words and fill in the blank with business-related vocabularies. Lecturers and students discuss together to solve the vocabulary. The word</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">system is arranged in accordance with the theme so as to facilitate understanding. English for Specific Purposes (ESP) can be done and seen clearly in the language text and content.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In addition to vocabulary, the compiled language component is grammar. Together with group members, students identify common grammatical, spelling, and possibly punctuation errors. On the worksheet, students must choose the best way to correct the errors highlighted in the given paragraph. Students are tested based on their knowledge of vocabulary and grammar usage. The contents of the paragraphs reflect ideological values that will be built by understanding a local Indonesian brand / brand, one of which is the local culture of batik keris, as the example below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">F. Find and correct </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">nine</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> mistakes in the following paragraph. (The first mistake has been corrected).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">biggest</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Batik Keris is the big batik and Indonesian souvenir retail. They sell a variety of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Batik product, including scarves, clothing, bags, and other souvenir such as wayang</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">puppets, topeng masks and household goods. The cost of the batik clothing depend on how the batik was make: namely, batik made using </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">canting</span><span class="font6"> tend to be more expensive than those made use </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">cap.</span><span class="font6"> However, the prices for all the products at Batik Keris is very reasonable and is not burdensome at all. On average, a batik shirt costing around Rp. 200,000 ($20).</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Figure 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities identifying grammatical errors</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">In this teaching material some units also inserted short paragraph writing skills. The ideology given is adjusted to the subject of each unit. In order the students learn the vocabulary, usage, and values contained in the cultural context that is given universally. As in the following activities writing activities are about the brand that students like and give reasons for the selection of the brand. The language skill emphasized is writing skills. After the students are equipped with knowledge about the brand and its characteristics, they are expected to be able to write their own brand that they want to develop / create as below:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The composition of teaching materials above has all the characteristics of ecolingusitic namely relations, context, patterns / systems, emergence, quality, value, critical, variability,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">diversity, and activity (van Lier, 2004, 2010). Then, the researcher designs teaching materials by considering the principles of the preparation of ESP teaching materials based on Hutchinson &amp;&nbsp;Waters (1987). According to Hutchinson &amp;&nbsp;Waters (1987), teaching materials must be able to provide a stimulus; help organizing the teaching and learning process by preparing learning pathways that have a variety of variations and structure of language that learners can systematically learn to the maximum; represent the perspective of the characteristics of language and learning; represent the nature of a learning activity; expand the repertoire of instructional learning practices and provide models of language use that are correct and relevant to the learning context.</span></p>

The characteristics of relations, context, and values are reflected in the topic elements of teaching materials in the syllabus that have strong relations with the biological, social and ideological environmental situations. Then for ideology that is reflected in the topics chosen by students in the analysis of teaching materials and needs will be a reference for lecturers to choose the lingual form in the preparation of teaching materials. Moral values contained in teaching situations can be practiced in every class interaction. The following characteristics are patterns / systems and qualities that are reflected in linguistic elements and teaching materials.

<p><span class="font8">This study aims to find an English learning model using an ecolinguistic approach in the preparation of syllabus and teaching materials. In the composition of teaching materials there is also a relationship between one element with another element. The composition of teaching materials is arranged based on the characteristics of the ecolinguistic approach, namely relations, context, patterns / systems, emergence, quality, value, critical, variability, diversity, and activity. Lingual content reflects the character of relations, context, values, and language systems that have a relationship to the knowledge and experience the tudents have had. The flow of teaching materials contains language activities to encourage students to think critically, to have activities, and to quickly respond to students with the quality of learning outcomes provided. While the way of learning and student learning outcomes shows variability, diversity, and quality in accordance with the language production produced. Therefore the content and flow of learning activities are integrated in the composition of teaching materials.</span></p>
