<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract </span><span class="font3">Elements of street furniture are an integral part of other urban planning elements that give a city a special image and character that can enhance the identity of the city itself. The city of Gianyar is a commercial area, which is precisely along Jalan Ngurah Rai which is the center of trade, government and recreation. As a commercial area, so the physical quality is very important in this area. As a commercial city, this area has not fully improved and improved existing facilities and infrastructure, such as the arrangement of street furniture elements, which are one of the supporting elements of a public space. This can be achieved by designing street furniture that has good function and quality and is integrated with other street face elements to avoid environmental incoherence. The need for street furniture as a public open space facility is increasingly being felt and needed by the community, especially for pedestrians as a supporting element for friendly public spaces in Gianyar City to provide comfort for its users. The research method uses a descriptive method with a qualitative approach. A qualitative approach is carried out in the process of observing and analyzing elements of street furniture and pedestrian comfort in the Ngurah Rai corridor, Gianyar. This research aims to create and improve city infrastructure that is comfortable and friendly for pedestrians of various groups, both in terms of access, aesthetics, security, and safety and comfort.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Design and planning in a city is very important to create a good physical quality of the city. One of the important elements in urban planning is the existence of public spaces. Where public space is a container that is used to facilitate public interests and the interests of the general public such as city parks, squares, fields and pedestrians. Public space owned by a city can provide a special image and character that can improve the quality of a city. The image of a city is a mental image that is formed from the biological rhythms of a particular place and space that reflects a sense of time or time that is grown from within by the social-economic-cultural activities of the urban community itself. The imageforming elements of the city itself consist of edges, nodes,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">districts, paths and landmarks. The city of Gianyar is a regency that is included in the province of Bali, with an area of 368 km², and a population density of 11,784 people (central statistics agency, 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gianyar City is a commercial area both as a trade center and government center which is located right on Jalan Ngurah Rai which forms the corridor of Gianyar City. As a commercial area, this area is an area that accommodates community activities and traffic activities which are quite dense during the day and night. So that physical quality is very important in this area. Good physical quality in a city can strengthen the identity that the city wants to achieve. One of them is the establishment of street furniture elements for pedestrians. street furniture is all forms of road fittings and is found on the ground with the aim of procurement is to achieve optimal road function in the sense of safety, comfort and beauty) The application of elements of street furniture is widely available in this area, but as a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">commercial city, this area has not fully improve and improve existing facilities and infrastructure in the arrangement of street furniture elements such as street lights, sidewalks, and provision of other facilities. Mobility in the Ngurah Rai corridor is not only motorized vehicles but also pedestrians. Most of the pedestrians in this corridor are generated by office, commercial and recreational areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The flow of pedestrians in this corridor follows the pattern of the road network which is equipped with inadequate facilities such as the existing sidewalks that seem to be designed not to take into account safety and comfort, there are several motorized vehicles that climb onto the sidewalk bodies, the sidewalks are used as selling areas for street vendors (PKL) ), Of course this can result in disruption of pedestrian comfort. Where comfort is one of the vital values that should be enjoyed by humans when carrying out activities in a space. so it is necessary to conduct research to analyze the relationship related to the arrangement of street furniture elements on the comfort of pedestrians from various groups, by evaluating and improving infrastructure including city supporting facilities and infrastructure that are comfortable and pedestrianfriendly, both in terms of access, aesthetics, security and safety as well comfort</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">A city is formed because of several elements, such as the shape and mass of buildings, circulation, parking and pedestrian ways. So that the pedestrian path is an important urban design element, Street Furniture is always placed along the main road or neighborhood road which functions as a supporting facility for community activities on the main road. Street furniture or street furniture are all elements placed collectively on a street landscape for the convenience, enjoyment, information, circulation control, protection and enjoyment of road users. Comfort is everything that shows the use of space in an appropriate and harmonious manner, both with space itself and with various shapes, textures, colors, symbols or signs, sound and sound impressions, intensity and color of light or smell, or other factors that influence comfort, namely: circulation, climate or natural forces, noise, smells or smells, form, safety, beauty. (Judge and Utomo in Astria, Ricky, 2019).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The research method uses a qualitative descriptive method by prioritizing primary data as the main data by surveying the location and comparing it with existing theory. A qualitative approach is carried out in the process of observing and analyzing elements of street furniture and pedestrian comfort in the Ngurah Rai corridor, Gianyar. In this process, the results of observations and analysis are presented descriptively regarding the arrangement of street furniture, pedestrian comfort in accordance with the facts found in the field.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Road signs and information are boards that provide instructions to road users regarding directions, places and information, which include preliminary signs, major (direction) signs, places and information, which include affirmation signs, area boundary signs and other signs that provide information and useful facilities for road users1(3) . Information boards (signages) are placed on the paths of social interaction points, on lanes with dense pedestrian flows, with the size needed, and the materials used are made of materials that have high durability, and do not cause glare effects1(4). Information boards installed along the Ngurah Rai corridor area (segment I) are blocked by trees so that these boards are difficult to see by road users. The arrangement and placement of road signs and information must be rearranged to make it more informative and the installation of signage along the Ngurah Rai corridor segment I area so as not to exceed those that affect the visual aesthetics of the road corridor. The markings must be adequately spaced one to another and avoid crowding and clutter.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/105815-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:241pt;height:92pt;">

<p><span class="font3">c) Bollard</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bollards The existence of bollards, both round and tubeshaped, has the same function, namely to prevent vehicles or moving furniture from moving up and even entering the pedestrian area. Bollards, a kind of stone blocks that function as a barrier between pedestrian paths and vehicle lanes. Bollards can also function as a low light/light spot. The material used for bollards is concrete or masonry. The distance between the bollards is 1.5 m. the height of the bollards is 0.9–1.2 m. Bollards are made to be easy to see even at night. In the city of Gianyar, bolards have not yet been found, so that motorized vehicles often use pedestrian lanes when traffic jams occur on the highway. Placement of bollards in the segment I area of the ngurah rai corridor has a distance of less than 1.5 m. this is of course inefficient and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the position of the bollard is not parallel to</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">d)Street Lighting</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Street lighting in urban areas has several functions, including: to produce contrast between objects and the road surface, as a navigation aid for road users, to increase the safety and comfort of road users, especially at night, to support environmental safety, to provide beauty for the road environment, to observe the results look at the corridor 1 area, the lighting has a Balinese-style design that beautifies the area. However, in this area the distance of the lights is too close together, causing a waste of energy in the pedestrian area. Natural street lighting facilities must meet the following requirements: a. Placed on the left side of the traffic lane according to the traffic direction or on the traffic island; b. Distance of street lighting poles is at least 0.60 meters from the edge of the traffic lane; c. The height of the lowest part of the street lighting is at least 5.00 meters from the road surface. In addition, the placement of street lighting lamps must add to the aesthetics at night in an even number and while still paying attention to energy saving areas, their placement must be considered so as to create an integrated area. The existence of street lights supported by the right design and arrangement will form the impression of a place and provide a local cultural identity that can still be preserved.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The green line is a path for the placement of plants and other landscape elements which are located in the space owned by the road (RUMIJA) as well as in the road monitoring room (RUWASJA). Plantation path is part of the road provided for the planting of trees and other plants which are placed continuously along the sidewalk, bicycle lane or road shoulder and road median. City parks are part of green open spaces in urban areas. The function that is emphasized from the city park is the aesthetic aspect, namely maintaining the beauty and cleanliness of the city area so that the desired goals can be achieved. in the corridor 1 area, the park in the pedestrian area looks monotonous with 1 type of plant so that this area looks less beautiful. Then the gliding block in this area is a dead end, making it dangerous for the blind to cross this area.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/105815-7.jpg" alt="" style="width:241pt;height:76pt;">

In addition, the placement of street lighting must add to the aesthetics at night in an even number and while still paying attention to energy saving areas, their placement must be considered so as to create an integrated area. The existence of street lamp lighting supported by the right design and arrangement will provide a characteristic of local cultural identity that needs to be preserved and considered in accordance with the original planning objectives. However, there are several lampposts that have fallen, this is dangerous and damages the beauty of the environment in this area.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/105815-11.jpg" alt="" style="width:241pt;height:146pt;">
