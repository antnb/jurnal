<p><span class="font3">This article aims at introducing the effective Communicative approach, with RELUS techniques applied in the process of English course for the members of the society. The data derived from the impression conducting such course in the year of 2015, and collected by direct observation and random interview. The course was attended by 40 members of Pokdarwis Mekar Bhuana in Pangsan Village, Petang subdistrict, Badung Regency. The course materials were about English functions and English for Tourism. The speaking materials were delivered in terms of conversational process using the techniques of: RELUS (R=read, LU =look up, S=say).

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bali consists of eight regencies and one municipality. They are Badung, Klungkung, Gianyar, Tabanan, Buleleng, Bangli, Karangasem, Jembrana and Denpasar. Since Bali as the international tourist destination, the local government of Badung Regency has established what is called group of Tourism Awareness in every village. Such group is responsible for the development and maintenance the flowing of tourism activity in the respective villages. In order to get thoroughly involved in such activity, the members must take part actively in the human resource development, such as taking orientation in tourism promotion, marketing and English courses. The English course called ESP is basically intended to improve their communication skill to enhance the tourist visit in their village. The government in cooperation with the English Department, Udayana University conduct such an English course every year. The activity has been commenced since 1998 starting at Plaga village Petang subdistrict, the very north part of the regency as the pioneer. Then every year, with the duration of 24 sessions (approx. 3 months) the members of the group learn and practice the language functions of English: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">greeting, farewell and special expressions, apologizing, request, invitation, suggestion </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">English for Tourism </span><span class="font4">are the core of the course-materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The problems to be further discussed in this article are (1) How the society members manage to learn English; (2) what materials offered to accommodate</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the participants’ needs (3) what approaches used to stimulate their speaking skills and the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">II MATERIALS AND METHODS</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/21150-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:226pt;height:123pt;">

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3.3 &nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Course Approaches and Evaluation</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The approaches applied during the course is Communicative Approach, under the subtitle of Communication Language Teaching (Richards, 2001). The systematical ways operated in order to success are subdivided into: (1) Methods and (2) Techniques.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>3.3.1</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methods</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The method of conducting such English program based upon the principles developed by O’Galperin (1979). He is a Switzerland education expert writing his famous book entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Teaching with Success</span><span class="font4"> conveys the following steps:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3.3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orientation</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/21150-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:308pt;height:184pt;"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The appointed materials were briefly introduced with the daily English sentences. The key-words or patterns were given to accelerate their knowledge with the expected course goal. This step is also intended to make the participants feel </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">from the beginning of the course.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3.3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drills</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">In order to give more access for the participants to exercise themselves, whether with group work, dialogue and individual practice. The trainer was very concerned with the application of the rule and pattern of the English sentences.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3.3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Susan M. Gass (2016:336) states that when learners engage in interaction with another individual , there is often feedback on that learner’s language as a result of a communication breakdown or even a pedagogical intervention This</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">is good time for the trainer to give reinforcement : (a) positive reinforcement when the drill runs well, usually by giving appreciation, however (b) negative reinforcement when the participants turned out having obstacles in terms of pronunciation, lexical choices or arranging well-formed sentences. If this case happens, usually the trainer would repeat the orientation step simply by giving feedback for the only obstacles they participants may face.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3.3.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuation</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">This step is usually done when everything in the feedback process runs smoothly and the progress of the course must go forward. This is one indication that the course is successful</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>3.3.2</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Techniques</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">RELUS is an acronym of RE (read) L U (look up) and S (say). Some experts in teaching conversation and speaking would prefer using this technique. The advantage is, of course giving the participant not only reading the dialogue, however they try to memorize the simple pattern. The speaking class participants would try to read and memorize certain pattern of expression, and without looking at the text again, they can practice while looking at the person spoken with. This is very effective in obtaining the speaking skill.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3.3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">This technique is usually done for the beginner to start the conversation. In this technique, however the participants are not </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">read</span><span class="font4">ing loudly after looking at the dialogue text, they merely memorize and then quickly look at his/her partner.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3.3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look Up</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">This technique is commonly not applied in the English-class, even in the conversation. The participants are usually busy looking at the dialogue text. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Look-up </span><span class="font4">technique in this case is very useful because both the speaking participants could make eye contact. While making such contact, they would recount their memory about the language pattern.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3.3.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">This last technique is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">say </span><span class="font4">done automatically after both participants look up each other. This is very important for the participant to measure their skill in memorizing such English pattern they just read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From this valuable technique, the conversation is called successful when the participants can converse without looking at the dialogue text and basically it happens without reading, losing eye-contact. Conversation is naturally done simultaneously without reading the text.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In order to obtain the expected result and to meet the course goals, a series of evaluations steps to be done, namely:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual Drill, every participant is given opportunity to be evaluated. The trainer call one by one and ask each participant respectively. The participant individually answers, practices the intended materials under the supervision of each trainer. When the participant has problem, each trainer directly gives feedback and solution dealing with such a problem. This system turns out very stimulating each participant.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/21150-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:322pt;height:175pt;"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pair Practice, the ten participants for each group is subdivided into pair with the role-play practice. The trainer is prepared to feedback them whenever they have difficulties. This system brings benefit in terms of motivating each pair to speak more confidentially.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group Practice is usually carried out when the materials are general. The trainer expects all participants to repeat together the new words or phrases, then give correction whenever the mispronunciation occurs.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IV CONCLUSION</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The course is considered success because some of the participants rely on the principal steps of mastering English as a Foreign Language, such as:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1)</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concrete Goal</span><span class="font4">, the participants have already had the goal to be local guides</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(2)</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Propensity</span><span class="font4">, nearly every time, some of them feel an ‘urge’ to use English</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(3)</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desire</span><span class="font4">, some of them start having certain wish for knowing more English</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(4)</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation</span><span class="font4">, they have instrumental motivation rather than integrative one (cf. Gardner, and Lambert, 1972:3)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(5)</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action</span><span class="font4">, there is no other choice than taking actions, such as attending English course.</span></p></li></ul>
