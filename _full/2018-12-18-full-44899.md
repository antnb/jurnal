The second piece of software that will be used to create programs that will run on sensor Accelerometer ADXL345, henceforth will be visualized in the form of graphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1. The design of sensor accelerometer ADXL345</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the design of the hardware, will be made a series of vibration sensors that connect between the ADXL345 and Arduino and a USB cable that will connect the Arduino with the computer, as shown in Figure 1.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/44899-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:219pt;height:109pt;">
<p><span class="font1">Fig.1 Design of accelerometer ADXL with Arduino and computer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Accelerometer ADXL345 and Arduino must be connected at some pins. This pin must be connected between the accelerometer ADXL345 and Arduino:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pin CS (chip select) and a 5V pin on the Accelerometer ADXL345 connected with pins on an Arduino UNO 3v3. This pin serves as a place of power supply of both.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ground (GND) Pin on the Accelerometer ADXL345 connected with GND pin on the Arduino. This pin serves as a place to ground.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pin (SDA) on Accelerometer ADXL345 connected with A4 pin on the Arduino. This pin serves as the serial input data on I2C communication.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pin (SCL) on Accelerometer ADXL345 connected with pin A5 on the Arduino UNO. SCL pin on the accelerometer ADXL345 here serves as a clock on the I2C data communications.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USB cable will be connected to the Notebook via the USB port found on the Arduino and accelerometer and the microcontroller automatically will be active once connected on the notebook marked with RX TX and lights turned on.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design of application Program Arduino IDE</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The Arduino IDE is useful of the Arduino software as the compiler for the Arduino microcontroller type using C language for programming. On the Arduino IDE software for this program will be created that contains instructions that will be executed by the Arduino microcontroller. Program that will be created will arrange communication</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">between Arduino with Accelerometer ADXL345 using the I2C communication as well as setting work on the accelerometer ADXL345. In a program that made this microcontroller will only read the data axis acceleration x, y and z from the measurements performed by the accelerometer ADXL345 and further the acceleration results data will be sent to computer. This is done by way of making the microcontroller just read the output to address acceleration axes x, y and z on the accelerometer ADXL345. The first step to do initialization of accelerometer ADXL345 and instruction-instruction used in the Arduino microcontroller.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data communications without wires</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The design of data communication with no wired or wireless was conducted after the program can communicate with the arduino and accelerometer response has been received in its entirety through the USB cable. The design is</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">shown in Figure 2.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/44899-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:132pt;height:117pt;">
<p><span class="font1">Fig. 2. The Arduino with radio communication</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The selected communication radio is a radio that has a frequency that is legal and free to use. In this frequency planning is used 433MHz, with a maximum transmitter power of 100mW.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data analysis</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In the operation of the rocket's payload uses the accelerometer ADXL345, common error error sending data for axes x, y and z. ADXL345 Sensor will get data acceleration be the change of layout and positioning of the payload of the axis x, y and z. Then the data taken will be sent to the Arduino using the communication Inter Integrated Circuit (I2C). In the Arduino microcontroller is using software inside that compile using Arduino IDE 1.0.6 compiler so the data shown axes x, y and z. After the data processed on the Arduino UNO R3 and produced data on axes x, y and z, then the data is sent to computer by using the radio TX/RX 433MHz for further processed and displayed on the computer through the application of Visual Basic in the form of graphs and numeric data. The data obtained are then processed using the standard deviation equation for knowing the value of the frequency limit will be the reference values for indicators of error.</span></p>
