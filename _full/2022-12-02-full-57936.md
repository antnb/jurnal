<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">This study aimed to analyze the procedures involved in translating English adverbials of manner into Indonesian. The data were taken from a bilingual biography entitled &quot;</span><span class="font0">Against All Odds.&quot; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A qualitative methodology was employed in this study. Additionally, the data were analyzed using the translation procedure theory proposed by Vinay and Dalbernet in Venuti (2010). The results of the data analysis are presented using a narrative approach and descriptive sentences. According to the findings of this study’s analysis, the English adverbials of manner can be translated into Indonesian by applying two methods, namely direct and oblique. Direct methods can be divided into borrowing, calque, and literal procedures. Meanwhile, oblique methods consist of equivalence and transposition procedures.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The grammatical structure of languages can be considered an important factor in translation, for example, in translating a text from English into Indonesian. Both English and Indonesian are different from each other in their phonological or grammatical aspects. Concerning these linguistic facts, Bell (1991) stated that languages are different from each other. They are different in the sense that they have distinct codes and rules regulating the construction of grammatical structures in language. The lexical meaning of the source language and target language will not be exactly the same. Besides, both languages have different cultural backgrounds. Therefore, it is very difficult to find the lexical equivalent of one language in another language in a translation. Larson (1998:3) stated that translation is basically a change in form. Translating then consists of studying the lexicon, grammatical structure, communication situation, and cultural context of the source language text, analyzing it in order to determine its meaning, and then reconstructing this same meaning using the lexicon and grammatical structures that are appropriate in the receptor language and its cultural context. In terms of the form of a language, it refers to actual words, phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, etc., whether they are spoken or written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A sentence or clause may alternatively be seen as comprising five units called elements of sentence or clause structure: subject, verb, complement, object, and adverbial, here abbreviated to S, V, C, O, and A. According to him, an adverbial is normally an adverb phrase, prepositional phrase, or adverbial clause. Adverbials may be single words or phrases that provide information about when, where, how, or why things happen. Adverbials can have some variation in terms of forms, functions, or meanings. For example, time, place, and manner in a clause or sentence can be stated by an adverbial, and it can be in the form of a noun phrase, adverb phrase, prepositional</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">phrase, or clause, and in general, the adverbial is capable of occurring in more than one position in the clause (Quirk:1985)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Adverbial can be divided into some categories; one of them is called &quot;adverbial of manner.&quot; The way an action is performed is expressed by the adverbial of manner. For example, in English, some adverbials of manner are formed by an adjective and the suffix </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;ly,&quot;</span><span class="font2"> for example, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">quiet-quietly, carefully-carefully</span><span class="font2">, etc. In Indonesian, an adverb of manner can be in the form of a single word, such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">secepatnya</span><span class="font2">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sebaliknya, sepenuhnya</span><span class="font2">, etc. Besides, it can be in the form of phrases. In prepositional phrases, it consists of the preposition </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dengan</span><span class="font2">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">secara</span><span class="font2">, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tanpa</span><span class="font2">; an adjective in an adjective phrase; or a noun in a noun phrase (Alwi et.al. 1998:370–371).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From this explanation, it can be seen that words and phrases that function as adverbials can be in various forms and meanings. In translating the adverbial stating manner from English into Indonesian, there will be some differences in terms of the grammatical structure and lexical items since each language has its own realization form of the adverbial. Therefore, this research is necessary to be done, and it is very challenging and interesting to conduct research on the topic of the translation of adverbial of manner from English into Indonesian, found in a biography book of a Balinese prince entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Against All Odds</span><span class="font2"> by Pucci (2004) and its Indonesian version, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menepis Segala Rintangan</span><span class="font2"> by Adidharma (2004).</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Qualitative research is an umbrella term for various approaches and methods in social studies (Saldana, 2011:3). The main purpose of qualitative research is to understand and explore the main phenomena in the object under study so as to obtain a deep understanding and something unique (Sugiyono, 2018: 10). The datasets from this study were analyzed using Vinay and Dalbernet's in Venuti (2000) theory of translation procedures. The results of this study are presented using Cresswell’s (2019: 267) methods and techniques, specifically a narrative approach and descriptive sentences.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials and Discussions</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Vinay and Dalbernet in Venuti (2000) stated that a translator can choose between two methods of translating, namely direct or literal translation and oblique translation. In terms of the direct translation method, it was found that there were two procedures, namely, borrowing and literal, applied in translating English adverbials of manner into Indonesian. Then, in the oblique translation method, two procedures were applied: equivalence and transposition.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct Translation Method</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In direct translation, it may be possible to transpose the source language message element by element into the target language. The direct translation method consists of three procedures, namely, borrowing, calque, and literal. The application of borrowing and literal procedures can be seen in the discussion below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">3.1.1 Borrowing Procedure</span></p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align:top;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A.</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Source Language</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Target Language</span></p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font2">“I must inform you that one of our largest stones here is growing”, he announced </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">formally</span><span class="font2"> (p.119)</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dengan formal</span><span class="font2"> ia mengumumkan, “Anda harus tahu bahwa salah satu batu terbesar disini sedang tumbuh” (p.184)</span></p></td></tr>
</table>
<p><span class="font2">From the data above, it can be seen that the predicate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">announced</span><span class="font2"> is modified by the adverbial of manner </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">formally</span><span class="font2">. How this predicate is performed is shown by this adverbial of manner. Therefore, it can be considered an adverbial of manner. This English adverbial was translated into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dengan formal</span><span class="font2"> in Indonesian. The adjective &quot;formal&quot; is considered a borrowing word since it is not a pure Indonesian word. Hornby (2010:589) defines &quot;formal&quot; as following an agreed or official way of doing things, whereas Alwi (2002:320) defines it as following regulations and applicable customs. From this explanation, it can be seen that the terms &quot;formal&quot; in English and Indonesian share a similar concept. The adjective &quot;formal,&quot; as the base word of the English adverbial of manner </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">formally</span><span class="font2"> is translated into Indonesian without any adjustment, whether in terms of spelling or pronunciation. As a result, it is clear that the English adverb </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">formally</span><span class="font2"> is translated into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dengan formal</span><span class="font2"> in Indonesian using a pure borrowing technique.</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aggressively</span><span class="font2"> can be considered an adverbial of manner in the source language sentence. How the predicate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">intervene</span><span class="font2"> is performed is shown by this adverbial. This English adverbial of manner is translated into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dengan agresif</span><span class="font2"> in Indonesian as the target language. In English, the adjective </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aggressive</span><span class="font2"> can be defined as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">being angry</span><span class="font2"> and behaving in a threatening way; ready to attack (Hornby, 2010:28); while </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">agresif</span><span class="font2"> in Indonesian is defined as being eager to attack (Alwi, 2002:13). From this explanation, it can be seen that the base adjective </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aggressive</span><span class="font2"> in the English adverbial of manner </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aggressively</span><span class="font2"> and adjective </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">agresif</span><span class="font2"> in Indonesian adverbial of manner </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dengan agresif</span><span class="font2"> share the same concept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The borrowing technique is applied in translating the English adverbial of manner into Indonesian, where there is an adjustment in translating those adverbials in terms of spelling. The adjective &quot;agresif&quot; is considered a borrowed word for which the spelling has been adapted to the Indonesian spelling rule. This technique is not considered a pure borrowing since adjustments are made in this translation. The translation is acceptable in the target language since the meaning of the adverbial is well preserved.</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font2">The adverbial of manner in the target language sentence is occupied by the phrase &quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">as if it were one of his patients.&quot;</span><span class="font2"> How the predicate &quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">take care&quot;</span><span class="font2"> is performed is shown by this adverbial. This English adverbial is translated into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">seperti salah seorang pasiennya</span><span class="font2"> in Indonesian. From this explanation, it can be seen that the message of the source language is directly transferred to the target language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The literal translation technique is applied in translating the adverbial of manner from English into Indonesian. There is no change in terms of meaning, and the translation is done literally, word per word. Basically, the English adverbial, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">as if it were one of his patients,</span><span class="font2"> can be</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">considered an idiomatic expression. It can be translated into another alternative way, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;dengan baik,&quot;</span><span class="font2"> in order to make the meaning explicit. It is translated into &quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">seperti salah seorang pasiennya&quot;</span><span class="font2"> in order to avoid the subjective interpretation of the translator. Therefore, it is translated literally into the same form as in the source language. The literal translation technique is applied. Specifically, the direct transfer from English into Indonesia is made to be grammatically and idiomatically appropriate.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oblique Translation Method</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The oblique translation method is used if literal translation is not possible to be applied. It is applied when the structural or conceptual elements of the source language cannot be directly transferred without upsetting the syntactic order. In this study, the oblique translation method was applied. This method can be divided into equivalence and transposition procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">3.2.1 Equivalence Procedure</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font2">In the data above, it can be seen that the function of the adverbial is occupied by the prepositional phrase &quot;with a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">smile in his heart.&quot;</span><span class="font2"> How the verb </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">settles</span><span class="font2"> is performed is shown by this prepositional phrase. This adverbial means &quot;happy.&quot; Then, it is translated into &quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dengan lapang dada&quot;</span><span class="font2"> in Indonesian, in which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lapang dada</span><span class="font2"> is considered an idiom, meaning </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">relieve; happy</span><span class="font2">. From this explanation, it can be seen that the English and Indonesian adverbials of manner reveal the same concepts. The equivalence technique is applied in translating the English adverbial of manner </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">with smile in his heart</span><span class="font2"> into the Indonesian adverbial of manner </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dengan lapang dada</span><span class="font2">. It can be seen that the same situation is described using different stylistic or structural means in the source language and the target language. It is considered acceptable since the message can be well transferred.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">&quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">In the same way,&quot;</span><span class="font2"> occupying the function of the adverbial. Since the occurrence of the predicate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">treated</span><span class="font2"> is explained by this adverbial of manner, then it can be considered an adverbial of manner. In translating this adverbial of manner into Indonesian, the equivalence technique is applied. In English, the adverbial </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in the same way</span><span class="font2"> means equality. In Indonesian</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">, tanpa pandang bulu</span><span class="font2"> shares the same concept in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the same way</span><span class="font2">. The adverbial of manner in Indonesia, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tanpa pandang bulu,</span><span class="font2"> is in the form of an idiomatic expression. In the same way, the English adverbial can be translated into a phrase that is considered an idiomatic expression, for example, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dengan cara yang sama</span><span class="font2">. The translation will be acceptable as long as it does not ruin the message. It can be done idiomatically or non-idiomatically.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The predicate in the source language sentence is indicated by the verb &quot;shouted&quot;. How this predicate is performed is explained by the prepositional phrase </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">at the top of his lungs</span><span class="font2">. Therefore, this prepositional phrase can be considered an adverbial of manner. The English prepositional phrase is considered an idiom since it is a group of words whose meaning is different from the meaning of the individual words (Hornby, 2010:744). This English idiom means &quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">as loudly as someone possibly can&quot;.</span><span class="font2"> This idiom is translated into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sekeras tenaga</span><span class="font2"> in Indonesian as the target language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The adverbial of manner, &quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sekeras tenaga&quot;</span><span class="font2"> in the target language, means </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">as powerful as someone can do</span><span class="font2">. The equivalence technique is applied to the translation of the adverbial of manner from English into Indonesian since at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the top of his lungs</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sekeras tenaga</span><span class="font2"> describe the same situation using different stylistic or structural means. In terms of meaning, both the source and target languages are on the same page and accept each other as equivalent translations. Even though the English adverbial </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">at the top of his lung</span><span class="font2"> is not translated into an idiom in Indonesian, the message is acceptable.</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font2">The adverb &quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">en masse&quot;</span><span class="font2"> in the source language is considered an adverbial of manner since the predicate &quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">migrate&quot;</span><span class="font2"> is shown by this adverb. According to Hornby (2010:487), it was defined as &quot;altogether&quot; and usually in large numbers. Then, this adverbial is translated into &quot;beramai-ramai&quot; which can be categorized as a verb. In Indonesian, the verb </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">beramai-ramai</span><span class="font2"> can be defined as doing something together (Alwi, 2002:924). From this explanation, it can be seen that the translation process does not change the meaning of the adverbial. In addition, the transposition technique is applied to the translation of adverbial manner from English into Indonesian. In English, the adverbial of manner is stated by an adverb, while in Indonesian it is translated into a verb. The transposition technique has proven since there is a change in terms of word class.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The adverbial of manner in the source language sentence is shown by the noun phrase &quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">great care,&quot;</span><span class="font2"> whose base word &quot;care&quot; can be defined as attention or thought that you give to something that you are doing so that you will do it well and avoid mistakes or damage (Hornby, 2010:212). Then, this English adverbial of manner is translated into the adverb phrase &quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dengan</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hati-hati&quot;</span><span class="font2"> in Indonesian, in which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hati-hati</span><span class="font2"> can be defined as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">being careful</span><span class="font2"> (Alwi, 2002:393). It can be seen that the transposition technique is applied to the translation of the English adverbial of manner into Indonesian in the example above, since there is a change in word class from a noun phrase into an adverb phrase. Even though there is a change in terms of word class in the translation of &quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">great care&quot;</span><span class="font2"> into &quot;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dengan hati-hati,&quot;</span><span class="font2"> the message can be acceptable.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The conclusion of this study can be described according to the result of the analysis in the discussion with regard to the procedures applied to the translation of the English adverbials of manner into Indonesian. In translating English adverbials of manner into Indonesian, there were two methods applied: direct and oblique translation. In this study, it was found that there are borrowing and literal procedures as the direct methods applied; and in terms of oblique methods, there are equivalence and transposition procedures. The direct method is applied to preserve the original message of the sentence by keeping the form as it is in the source language. The oblique method is applied due to the different linguistic systems and cultural background of the source and target languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was found that there are differences in terms of grammatical structures between English and Indonesian, which can be a problem for the translator trying to transfer the closest message of the source language sentence into the target language. There are some changes in terms of forms since the adverbials of manner in Indonesian are more complex. A translator must exercise caution when re-expressing a message from the source language into the target language.In addition, the translator should pay more attention to the terms of the culture and linguistic system of both the source and target language in order to obtain the closest translation equivalence.</span></p>
