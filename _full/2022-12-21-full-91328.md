<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">According to i Learners of English as a foreign language need to master a number of abilities, such as oral communication, reading comprehension, listening comprehension, and writing. Learners of second or foreign languages face particular challenges when it comes to the art of writing. Writing, the process of thinking to produce concepts, determining a strategy to categorize into clever writing, and composing the ideas into a statement and a paragraph clearly. For most people, it's their major means of expressing themselves intellectually, emotionally, and intellectually in general. Writing allows people to communicate ideas, sentiments, and persuasion and persuasion to others 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to 3 Writing anxiety, can be broken down into two types: somatic anxiety, and avoidance anxiety. Negative expectations, obsessive focus on one's own performance, and worry about how one is perceived by others are all examples of cognitive anxiety. One's sense of physical symptoms of worry, such as nervousness and tightness, is referred to as &quot;somatic anxiety.&quot; A kind of anxiety known as avoidance anxiety occurs when students are unable to write 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Student of the SMAN 6 Padang, on the other hand, is still apprehensive and hesitant about writing in English. According to 5 as a result of their incompetence, as well as that of the children they work with, this situation has occurred. They are unable to write in English because of their fear. They have to deal with their own issues, as well as those of their peers, teachers, and other members of the community. Writing anxiety is common among foreign language learners because of this β.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meanwhile, the researcher observed evidence of concern in his teaching practice at SMAN 6 Padang, where some students are still having difficulty expressing their ideas in formal manner. Students'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">101 </span><span class="font5">inability to complete their homework, confusion, lack of self-assurance, and difficulty deciphering and comprehending writing English are all signs that they are suffering from anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to 7 several factors cause them to be unable to understand the writing. First, the lack of background those students have when writing, especially in English. Therefore, they do not get an idea of what they have been writing. Second, the students do not master enough vocabulary when they are writing the text. So, this is will make it difficult for them to understand the writing because they are not able to get a good in writing in English.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It was mentioned before that there were three external elements that contributed to the students' anxiety when it came to writing in English. These factors are a lack of understanding about the stages of writing, a lack of learners' motivation, and a lack of practice. There were a total of six questions on the questionnaire.</span></p>
