Cardinal temperatures consist of minimum optimum and maximum of plant growth and might beable to be determined by assessing effect of temperature on seed germination An experiment ofseed germination was conducted in laboratory using thermal gradient plate for ten days To test hypothesisthat rapeseed genotypes vary in their response to temperatures The design of this experiment was asplit plot with four replications The maintreatments were 14 different tempe
