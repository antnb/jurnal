<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Covid-19 outbreak occurred in early 2020 which spread rapidly causing a major impact on the global tourism industry due to restrictions on community activities and restrictions on travel. Restrictions on tourism activities worldwide have caused a drastic decrease in the number of foreign tourist arrivals to Bali Province since the beginning of April 2020 which has an impact on Bali’s economic growth because the tourism sector contributes more than</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">50% to the GRDP of Bali Province (Merdeka, 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recovery efforts carried out by the Provincial Government of Bali and the Government of Indonesia through the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy in the recovery of tourism in the new normal era are encouraging the arrival of domestic tourists and local visitors by implementing health protocols in tourism activities by issuing standard and certification programs for cleanliness, health, safety, and environment sustainability, which is then</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">abbreviated as CHSE with the label of “In-donesiaCare” which has been regulated in the Regulation of the Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy of the Republic of Indonesia Number 13 of 2020 on tourism businesses, including the homestay business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Homestay businesses in the Ubud Tourism Area, from the beginning of tourism development in Bali to the Covid-19 pandemic, still maintain services and hospitality with a culture-based approach to the local community so that homestay businesses can be a safe and comfortable accommodation business choice, it is necessary to conduct research on management evaluation homestay business in the new normal era. Based on the urgency of this background, this article has the objectives of 1) to analyze the performance of homestay businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic, 2) to evaluate the management of CHSE-based homestay businesses in the Ubud Tourism Area, and 3) to formulate a recovery plan for these businesses. homestay business in the new normal era in the Ubud Tourism Area.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>LITERATURE REVIEW</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The theory used in this study is management theory (Terry, et al 2020) and crisis management theory (Ritchie, 2004). According to Terry et al. (2000) the achievement of predetermined goals is to use the help of human resources and other sources. The management function in this theory consists of 1) the planning function, which is to determine the goals to be achieved in the future, 2) the organizing function, namely classifying and determining activities and assigning responsibility to certain parties to carry out these activities., 3) the actuating function by determining the need for human resources through development to achieve the goals to be achieved and 4) the controlling function by measuring the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">implementation and deviations that occur in achieving the goals. Management theory is used to evaluate the management of homestay businesses in the Ubud Tourism Area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Crisis management is a strategic planning process for crises which consists of a process that changes some risks from negative conditions with the aim that organizations can control activities (Banks in Rini Sugiarti, 2012), Crisis management framework according to Fink (1986) in Ritchie , (2004) consists of four stages, namely 1) prodromal stage or the stage when a crisis occurs and cannot be avoided, 2) actuate stage or stages of crisis that cannot be handled and cause losses, 3) chronic stage or stages of post-crisis recovery conditions such as recovery, and 4) resolution is the stage of routine recovery back to a better or new direction. The chronic stage represents a crisis condition for homestay businesses in the new normal era in the Ubud Tourism Area.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The origin of the development of homestay businesses as the epicenter in the Ubud Tourism Area homestay has been known to have started in the early 1930s with the arrival of foreign painters who stayed at the Ubud Palace. Foreign tourists staying at that time were treated like family and were not treated as foreigners. The service and friendliness during their temporary stay at Puri Agung Ubud caused many foreign tourists to have the same experiences. Along with the times, Puri Ubud has inspired the local people in Ubud Village to change their residence into a temporary lodging place for tourists so that they can benefit economically and maintain arts and</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Harmony as an important aspect in achieving happiness is what homestay owners in the Ubud Tourism Area are trying to realize by applying the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Hita Kara-na</span><span class="font4"> philosophy.

Suteja (2012) in Wiweka (2014) explains that the philosophy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Hita Karana</span><span class="font4"> is three sources of happiness or well-being which consists of three aspects, namely the spiritual aspect (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">parahyangan</span><span class="font4">) which is a harmonious and balanced relationship between humans and</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">parahyangan</span><span class="font4"> aspect in Table 4 can be seen from the presence of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sanggah</span><span class="font4">, the family shrine and religious ceremonies carried out by homestay owners for spirituality and fostering a good relationship with God by carrying out traditional ceremonies and rituals that grow in Bali. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sanggah</span><span class="font4"> and traditional ceremonies from the owner’s family become a cultural sight when guests are in the Balinese Traditional Homestay compounds as shown in Figure 2.</span></p>

The foreign tourists in their uploads on Instagram media told the procession of the prayer ceremony and stated that participating in the celebration of the holiday was an unforgettable experience because they could recognize and understand the culture practiced in Bali as well as an authentic experience that cannot be experienced if they had stayed in hotels in general.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The picture above shows the activities of foreign tourists while staying at Nyoman Sandi Guest House. The activities offered include cooking class activities such as making Balinese culinary specialties, lawar, making and decorating prayer facilities such as canangs, offerings, rice harvesting activities in the rice fields and interacting with local farmers. Tourists can try to use the traditional clothes of the archipelago</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">such as using kebaya, cloth, and scarves. Experience is the first important element for tourists staying in homestays apart from room facilities. Tourists can interact with local families, eat Balinese food, and live life like a local is something that is not possible in a hotel. The owner of a homestay business in the Ubud Tourism Area in the palemahan aspect is reflected in physical care to maintain the sustainability and beauty of the environment. Homestay care can be done by doing spiritual cleansing or purification through a traditional ceremony procession to minimize the influence of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">leteh</span><span class="font4">, which means dirty or bad conditions that need to be neutralized through religious ceremonies that can foster a sense of security and comfort for tourists, employees, and homestay owners.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></h2>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Homestay Business Performance during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Ubud Tourism Area</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact on all sectors, including the tourism sector. The Ubud Tourism Area is a center for arts and cultural tourism, feeling the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, such as shop closures, job losses, and decreased income. The accommodation business in the Ubud Tourism Area must be temporarily closed because there are no tourists staying, as is the case with homestay businesses. The declining performance of homestay businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic includes a decrease in occupancy, operational changes, and a decrease in prices in managing homestay businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Covid-19 pandemic has caused hotel occupancy rates in Bali to drop drastically. Based on interviews with homestay business owners in the Ubud Tourism Area, there was a decline in homestay business occupancy in Ubud District by 80%, whi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">le before the pandemic the occupancy rate reached 90% to 100%. There was a 90% decrease in occupancy in Tegallalang and Payangan sub-districts because the two sub-districts are alternative destinations if accommodation businesses in Ubud District are fully booked or crowded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Changes in the operation of homestay businesses in the Tourism Area during the Covid-19 pandemic because there is an adaptation period in the new normal era. Homestay business owners must develop standard operating procedures during the Covid-19 pandemic for managers, employees, and tourists. Standard operating procedures for homestay managers or owners include setting operating hours or the deadline for tourist acceptance, limiting the number of tourists in one room, the need to use masks and the flow of tourist entrances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Covid-19 pandemic has caused several accommodation businesses to temporarily close their operations or reduce prices and provide vouchers for tourists who stay overnight to generate income during the Covid-19 pandemic. Accommodation businesses in the Ubud Tourism Area which consist of homestay businesses, villas, hotels and resorts provide the best offers at lower prices compared to conditions before the Covid-19 pandemic. Competition in price offers between accommodation businesses is due to price declines, which is one of the efforts to survive during the pandemic, as has been done from star hotels to homestay businesses. A homestay business in the Ubud Tourism Area with complete facilities such as a bedroom, swimming pool, breakfast, Air Conditioner (AC) faci-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">lities and community activities before the Covid-19 pandemic which has a normal price range of Rp. 400,000/night up to Rp. 650.000/night must compete with five-star hotels that offer the same price as the normal price range for homestay businesses. This causes the homestay business to have to reduce the price to half of the normal price so that the business can survive for the cost of maintaining facilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The results of observations and surveys conducted show that the normal homestay price range before the Covid-19 pandemic and the promo price during the Covid-19 pandemic per night in the Ubud Tourism Area can be seen in Table 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The comparison of homestay prices before the pandemic and during the pandemic in Table 5.1 provides an overview of the change in homestay rates in normal situations and during the Covid-19 pandemic it fell by 50% with the hope that domestic tourists could stay because the market for new normal tourism is domestic tourists and the local people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Homestay businesses in their performance during the Covid-19 pandemic were circumvented by packing staycation packages. Staycation is a form of vacation or recreation in a tourism area that has a relatively close distance, with a short time and a more affordable price. The packaging of the staycation trend in the homestay business is to offer room use packages with conditions for check-in and check-out on the same day (Day Use) and the use of rooms for 2 days 1 night (One Night Stay) as offered by Gunung Merta Bungalows in Figure 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Figure 5. describes the steps in the CHSE-Based Management verification and certification process for Tourism Businesses. The CHSE-Based Homestay Business Management verification and certification process begins with registering a homes-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tay business identity and account activity on the official website of the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy. Registration and account activity is done by registering an active email address and activating an account. The next step is to conduct an assessment according to the CHSE Implementation Guidelines for Homestay Businesses. The assessment process can be done online. Homestay owners can download the questionnaire or assessment form provided on the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy website.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For homestay businesses that meet the assessment criteria, the homestay business owner will be directed to upload a selfdeclaration statement by sending the results of the self-assessment to the system which will be forwarded to the Auditor Team. The self-assessment audit process will be carried out by a team of auditors consisting of a national integrated team (Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy, Ministry of Health, and the Association of Indonesian Hotels and Restaurants), the Bali Provincial Government and the Gianyar Regency Government. The self-assessment statement that has been carried out by the homestay owners will be forwarded to the auditor to go to the process stage by following up on filling out the questionnaire and supporting evidence that has been submitted by the homestay business owners. Homestay owners who pass the validation process can fill out a self-declaration statement and get an “I do Care” Certificate and Labeling by an Indonesian certification agency, but homestay owners who do not pass will be given a recommendation by the auditor team to draw up corrective steps according to the parameters that have not been met.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of tourism businesses that received CHSE certification in Bali Province based on data contained in the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy’s website consists of 1006 businesses consisting</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of 41 tourist attractions, 215 homestay and tourist cottage businesses, 528 hotels, 178 restaurant units and 9 transportation service businesses.

<p><span class="font4">The Ubud Tourism Area was part of the ‘We Love Bali’ campaign held on November 25, 2020 to November 26, 2020 through the visit of participants to tourist attractions in Ubud Sub-District, Tegallalang Sub-District and Payangan Sub-District. Participants got facilities of accommodation for two nights at a hotel or homestay that have been determined by the committee. Participants visited tourist attractions that had implemented the CHSE protocol including Puri Saren Ubud (Ubud), Ceking Rice Terrace (Tegallalang) and Sekar Bumi Farm (Payangan). Visits to tourist attractions were ended by going to the accommodations that have been determined by implementing health protocols.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The accommodation businesses in Ubud District that have been selected are those that have implemented the CHSE protocol and are ready to serve We Love Bali participants.

<p><span class="font4">The performance of homestay businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic experienced a drastic decline. Evaluation of the implementation of management of homestay businesses based on CHSE in the Ubud Tourism Area has been carried out on 30 homestay businesses with good implementation (76.20%), but still needs to be improved, for example on the parameter Setting the Distance on the Seat or Floor in the Reception Unit with a score of (50.67%) which means the implementation was quite good. The recovery plan for Homestay businesses in the Ubud Tourism Area in the new normal era is guided by strengthening human resources, strengthening operational resources, and strengthening administration and management. Recommendations</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">that can be given include (1) the Gianyar Regency Government needs to evaluate the parameters of CHSE certification and, facilitate CHSE-based health protocols for homestay actors (2) Tourism entrepreneurs are expected to be able to build synergy and support CHSE-based homestay management. (3) The homestay owner supports the CHSE certification program and forms an integrated network of homestay business owners in the Ubud Tourism Area. (4) Academics are expected to be able to map the tourism potential in the Ubud Tourism Area, which can be promoted with the activities of tourists staying at homestays.</span></p>
