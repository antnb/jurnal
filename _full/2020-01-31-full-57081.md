<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract*</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The current study attempts to describe the lexicon “sakit” in Bimanese used by Mbojo ethnic group in daily communication and analyze the meaning difference from the semantic perspective. The research applied descriptive qualitative method of analysis and the data were collected by using fishbowl, recording, and note taking technique. Based on the data analysis the findings reveal that thirteen lexicons “sakit“ are used by Mbojo ethnic group in daily communication including supu [supu], hengge [hengge], sari’i [sari’i], rambo [rambo], mbalo [mbalo], mancoro [mancoro], kantero [kantero], duha [duha], pili [pili], ngelu [ngelu], ncara oi [ncara ᴐwi], mbowi [mb ᴐwi] and winte [winte].</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ethnic group. Bima language recognizes various types of lexicon. One of them is the lexicon “sakit”. Regarding the environment, Bima language (BL) has a lot of lexicons related to illness. The various meanings shared by a language or a lexicon affected by culture and the environment make it difficult to understand the inherent meaning. As stated by Setiawan, Beratha, &amp;&nbsp;Ni Wayan Sukarini (2019) that the complexity of meaning shared in a language can be influenced by the presence of cultural and environmental features leading to difficulty in understanding the inherent meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today most languages, in particular certain lexicon associated with verbs, are unknown or unused by some local people in the sense that they are extinct. Babaci-Wilhite (2013) states that if local languages were harmonized, this would help to protect traditions through stories, myths, and songs. Furthermore, Faridy &amp;&nbsp;Syaodih (2017) states that moreover the use of local languages contains norms that make up the speaker Most of the lexicons that are the richest language in the region are no longer used in every day communication. This happens because some communities and especially new generations do not make efforts to know, learn, understand and find out the lexicon used by Mbojo ethnic group in everyday life. Societies no longer attempt to learn and find out a distinctive language, but turn to lexicons as well as common terms generally used by the local people especially the foreign language terms. In fact, the typical languages give the potential for the richness of language and keep them in order that they may not disappear and switch to a new language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In general semantics can be defined as meaning studies in language of which the meaning of can be studied in many ways, for example a philosopher will examine the meaning of language in terms of the word relationship with objects or events in the universe. This is in line with Bast &amp;&nbsp;Buchhold (2016, p.120) states that Semantics is the study of meaning. Likewise, other experts will study the meaning of language in terms of their respective knowledge so that they will be able to interpret every word according to the context. The meaning of language occurs at all levels of language including the level of words, phrases, idioms or sentences. Bimanese also undergo the same phenomena. There were some previous studies related to the semantics; Hussain &amp;&nbsp;Sajid (2015, p. 39) states that linguistic semantics is the conventional meaning conveyed by the use of words, phrases and sentences of a language. Evelyn Hatch and Cheryl Brown (2001) states that the term semantics refers to the study of meaning and the systematic ways those meanings are expressed in language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Cruze (1986), states that meaning is related to form for which the intended form in this case is the language. In reality the process of communication across languages often finds several obstacles. This indicates that each language has its own uniqueness in different forms that have no equivalent meaning for certain forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the background above, the issues can be formulated as follows: What kinds of lexicon sharing the meaning “sakit” in Mbojo ethnic group in daily communication? The study aims to describe the lexicons “sakit” used by the Mbojo ethnic group in daily communication.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The research used qualitative descriptive method. The sense of describing in detail and clearly the phenomenon of language related to the meaning and the environment in particular the lexicon “</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sakit</span><span class="font3">” used in everyday life by the Mbojo ethnic group. The data in this study were collected from an oral speech through three stages, namely (a) data collection used fishbowl, recording, and note-taking technique. (b) data analysis, and (c) presentation of the data analysis results. At the stage of providing data, two methods were used, namely listening and asking</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">methods. The researchers interviewed directly the main source of data or informants. This is in line with Mahsun (2012) stating that the method of providing data by a capable method is due to the way taken in collecting the data in the form of an interview between the researcher and the informant. Meanwhile, the data analysis stage used the equivalent method and the method of apportion. The equivalent method used in analyzing the data in the current study was the referential equivalent method with the basic technique determining the element technique. Furthermore, the distributional method used the technique to obtain direct elements as the basic technique. Presenting the results of the data analysis used the formal and informal methods.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Having analyzed the data, it can be concluded that Bimanese is one of the local languages in Indonesia. The analysis is related to the semantic perspectives of the phenomenon shared by the lexicon &quot;sakit&quot; associated with the eco-language. The findings show that thirteen lexicons “sakit“ are used by Mbojo ethnic group in daily communication. The lexicons of “sakit”include supu [supu], hengge [hengge], sari’i [sari’i], rambo [rambo], mbalo [mbalo], mancoro [mancoro], kantero [kantero], duha [duha], pili [pili], ngelu [ngelu], ncara oi [ncara ᴐwi], mbowi [mb ᴐwi], and winte [winte].</span></p>
