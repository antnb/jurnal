<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Opini dari masyarakat penting bagi instansi atau pihak di bidang tertentu, karena dapat menunjukkan kecenderungan pendapat masyarakat terhadap sesuatu (seperti objek atau proses). Salah satunya pada bidang transportasi. Transportasi sudah menjadi kebutuhan bagi masyarakat, berbagai hal cenderung lebih efektif dan efisien berbasis online, sehingga transportasi online menjadi penting bagi masyarakat. Maraknya transportasi online, membuat cukup banyak masyarakat menyatakan berbagai opini atau pendapat mengenai pelayanan transportasi online melalui media sosial. Tingkat pelayanan untuk transportasi online menjadi penting diketahui mengingat banyaknya pengguna, sehingga dapat dijadikan sebagai dasar perbaikan. Salah satu cara mengetahui opini masyarakat terhadap transportasi online di media sosial adalah dengan analisis sentimen. Penelitian ini menggunakan bantuan Google Machine Learning untuk proses analisis sentimen yang menghasilkan nilai accuracy sebesar 82.6%, precision sebesar 82.2%, recall sebesar 83.3% dengan hasil sentimen paling banyak menunjukkan bahwa opini masyarakat masuk ke dalam kategori sentimen negatif untuk perusahaan Gojek pada media sosial Twitter.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Transportation is the support that is needed by the community in their daily life, such as public transportation, taxis, and motorbikes to go somewhere. Along with the times, Indonesians tend to use online-based transportation services compared to conventional transportation services. Online-based transportation utilizes services, vehicles, and mobile device technology as a tool for ordering and delivering people and goods to be faster, easier, anywhere and anytime, thus helping to facilitate people in their daily activities, as well as reducing traffic jam, air pollution, as well as oil and energy consumption [1].</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Statista's data in 2019, there was a significant jump of opinion, it is about 21.7 million. This is because, the Indonesian people started using various kinds of transportation services [2]. Public opinion about online transportation tends to be conveyed more through social media. In addition, research data by Statista in 2019 also suggests that there are 150 million active social media users in Indonesia [2]. Social media is used as a forum to connect people as consumers and technology companies, as transportation service providers in obtaining information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Information is important for technology companies in the transportation sector, because it can show a tendency for public opinion or opinion on the level of service. The method used to find out public opinion on online transportation on social media is sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is carried out by classifying and analyzing thought patterns or responses in the form of someone's opinion, comments about an object or process, and distinguishing a context with positive, neutral, or negative content. The sentiment data used are the sentiments of the Indonesian people expressed through social media, such as Twitter, Youtube, or digital news. Previous research related to sentiment analysis, namely comparing sentiment analysis regarding Indonesian text using Support Vector Machine and Random Forest [3]; conducted a sentiment analysis on films using GloVe-DCNN [4]; conducted a classification of mobile application reviews on Google Play Store using Word Embedding and Convolutional Neural Network [5]; conducted an analyzed text based approach to track similar traffic incident using text similarity [6]; conducted a sentiment analysis regarding the President of Indonesia, namely Jokowi using Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine [7]; conducted a sentiment analysis regarding the Indian Prime Minister using the Recurrent Neural Network [8]; with the algorithm method, the comparison of sentiment analysis on movie reviews with Information Gain and K-Nearest Neighbor [9]; select the word features regarding book reader satisfaction using Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency [10]; conducted a text analysis on Indonesian Factoid Question Answering using Dependency Tree [11]; conducted an analyzed of attractions in Bali using snowflake tool [12]; conducted a sentiment analysis of student online in a postgraduate program with cloud-based Natural Language Processing tool [13]. The common method that have been use for sentiment analysis from the other research is algoritma naive and support vector machine, and previously not many researcher doing the research about sentiment analysis by using google machine learning for case study online transportation in Indonesia. Furthermore, the sentiment analysis in this study was carried out in a different way compared to previous studies, namely by utilizing Google Machine Learning on sentiment towards onlinebased transportation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Figure 6 is a flowchart of the stages in sentiment analysis. The first thing to do is to enter keywords related to the case study takem and to select the data source that was previously saved into the database as raw data. Next, carry out the NLP process using the help of the Google Machine Learning, namely the Cloud Natural Language API. After the sentiment analysis is complete, the data is stored again in database as result data. Then, the data is analyzed and re-evaluated to obtain information. Information is displayed in the form of data visualization in the form of diagrams, to make it easier to determine. An example of the results from labelled data is shown in Table 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Figure 7 is the formula of the calculation of accuracy, precision, recall values. Accuracy can calculated by summing all the right predictions and divided by of all the wrong predictions and than can percentante it with time 100%. All class precision score are calculated by summing the right predictions divided by the adding result from the right predictions and the wrong predictions in one of the past sentiment categories and than divided with three and times with 100%. All class recall are calculated by summing the right predictions divided by the adding result from the right predictions and the wrong predictions of the three sentiment categories and then divided by 3 and multiplied by 100%. Divided by 3 because there are three categories of sentiment used, positive, neutral, and negative sentiment. System testing in this study used data as much as 115 data. Data obtained from the results of sentiment categories determined by the system and questionnaires later, conducted comparison results as in Table 4. The performance of the application created and produce accuracy value of 82.6%, precision by 82.2%, recall by 83.3%.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Social media is a medium to make it easier for people to interact socially by communicating, sharing and exchanging information virtually and is interactive. There are several types of social media, such as Twitter and Youtube. Twitter is a social media that can</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">send and read text based messages with the names of tweets [14]. Youtube is a social media that can load, watch, comment, and share video clips for free [15]. Apart from social media, there is also a news portal website that can be used as a place to get information that can be searched through the help of the Google Search search engine. Google Search is a search engine on the web that is owned by Google Inc. [16].</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Text mining is a technique of analyzing and processing unstructured and semistructured textual data. The text mining process includes text categorization, text clustering, concept or entity extraction, sentiment analysis, document conclusion [17]. Sentiment analysis is a pattern of thought or response in the form of someone's opinion and comments about something, such as an object or process, by analyzing it and classifying it, so that a charged, positive, neutral, or negative context can be distinguished. Sentiment analysis is also useful for practitioners and researchers, such as sociology, marketing, advertising, psychology, economics, political, science, because it requires a lot of data about human-computer interactions [18].</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Google Machine Learning</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Machine learning is part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) where a system has the ability to learn on its own without explicit instructions. Machine learning learns about using algorithms on a computer to analyze and solve a problem by providing the correct answer, in order to gain predictive insight and make iterative decisions. So, Google Machine Learning is a service from the machine learning model created by Google. Google Machine Learning has 3 types, namely classification, regression and clustering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Natural Language Processing is a model approach to machine learning. One of the machine learning services provided by Google is Google Cloud Natural Language. Google Cloud Natural Language API can perform sentiment analysis in 16 languages, namely Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazilian &amp;&nbsp;Continental), Spanish, Thai, Turkish and Vietnamese. Google Cloud Natural Language service is done in two ways, namely using AutoML Natural Language and Natural Language API. The way Google Machine Learning works for AutoML Natural Language is done automatically, while how it works using the Natural Language API is done by using the API and adding in the code of the program that is created. Google Cloud Natural Language can analyze syntax, extract entities and evaluate sentiment text. Sentiment analysis by means of the Natural Language API was carried out through labeling, namely, score and magnitude. Score is a sentiment value ranging from 1.0 (positive), 0.0 (neutral), and -1.0 (negative) which correspond to the emotional tendencies of the entire text. Magnitude is a non-negative number in the range of 0 to infinity (+ inf) that measures the amount of sentiment in the text in absolute terms regardless of the score (positive or negative). The method that was used by Google Machine Learning has not been explained comprehensively. The document that contains the expression of the analysis models used by the API, are later retrained using an extensive body of text and natural language tools from Google. This API works by extracting a sentiment score and magnitude from the given document. Results of the sentiment score of each label provided by Google Machine Learning API is illustrated in Table 5. An example of labelled data is illustrated in Table 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The process of collecting data through social media and news portals, namely Twitter, Youtube, and Google Search regarding online transportation in Indonesia related to 3 technology companies providing transportation services, such as Blue Bird Group, Gojek, and Grab has been successfully carried out. The process that occurs, the data is stored into the database as raw data for data processing. Data processing for sentiment analysis uses the help of Google Machine Learning. Google Machine Learning helps in determining the sentiment category from the given data. After getting the sentiment results are displayed in the form of website-based data visualization. Sentiment results from the trends of each company and data sources vary at certain times. The performance of the program that has been successfully created using the help of Google Machine Learning with 115 test data yields an accuracy value of 82.6%, precision of 82.2%, recall of 83.4%. According to analysis result, most of online transportation data was retrieved from Twitter since Twitter faster and easier to use, and can reach a wider range of users to get more specific information compared to any other social media. Online transportation that had the most impression from users on Twitter is Gojek which got the most negative sentiment.</span></p>
