<p><span class="font4">The Salak Mountain II Resort Area, Halimun Salak National Park has several ecotourism objects that have a good ecotourist attraction. In the Salak Mountain II Resort area, there are several actors who have a role in management, where there are several obstacles faced during the course of the activity. The objectives in this study are 1) identifying elements in the management structure variables; 2) analyze the goals variable of ecotourism development, needs variable of ecotourism development, activity programs variable of ecotourism development, obstacles variable of ecotourism development, and actors variable of ecotourism development; 3) making the model of ecotourism management structuring. The method used in this study is descriptive qualitative with Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) analysis. The results of the study shown that the desired goals in managing the area are the conservation of natural resources and their ecosystems, and providing education to the community about environmental management. The desired need in area management is the existence of ecotourism legality. Some of the desired program activities in regional development and management are agrotourism, local cultural and artistic attractions, ecotourism, and natural recreation. Some obstacles in the development and management of the area are the limited human resources that have knowledge, skills in managing ecotourism areas and changes in the status of the utilization zone to the ecotourism zone. Salak Mountain II Resort Office, Koperasi Khalifah, Village-Owned Business Entity are actors who have very strong driving factors and function as variable linkage. Each element in the variable has different strengths as a driver and dependency.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Salak Mountain II Resort Area, Halimun Salak National Park (HSNP) is a natural resource conservation area that has very interesting ecotourism objects. This area has attractive landscape potential as an ecotourism area (Kusumoarto, Gunawan, and Nurazizah, 2017). There are 11 (eleven) ecotourism areas managed by the Salak MountainII Resort Office, HSNP. The ecotourism objects are Cigamea Waterfall Area, Kondang Waterfall Area, Hot Spring Area, Ngumpet Waterfall Area, Seribu Waterfall Area, Pangeran Waterfall Area, Muara Waterfall Area, Cihurang Waterfall Area, Ratu Crater Area, Camping Ground Area, and Alami Waterfall Area (Kusumoarto and Ramadhan, 2016). Tourist visits to this region in 2016 were recorded at 17,969 people. The highest number of visits to hot springs area was recorded at 4,668 people and visits to the camping ground area were recorded to be the smallest of 365 people. Ecotourism objects that have potential visits based on the perceptions and desires of visitors are Cigamea Waterfall Area, Kondang Waterfall Area, Hot Spring Area, and Ngumpet Waterfall Area (Jubei, Kusumoarto, Ernawati, 2017). Ecotourism</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">objects that have a level of visits with more than 1,000 visitors in 2018 are Hot Springs Area (4,668 people), Kondang Waterfall Area (3,824 people), Cigamea Waterfall Area (3288 people), Ngumpet Waterfall Area (1,328 people), Seribu Waterfall Area (1,328 people), and Pangeran Waterfall Area (1,072 people).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a natural resource conservation area, Salak Mountain II Resort Area, HSNP has good natural beauty, has biodiversity, cultural uniqueness, and easy accesibility to reach it (Kusumoarto and Ramadhan, 2016). The existence of natural resource potential and a number of constraints faced resulted in ecotourism objects in the region having different carrying capacity (Kusumoarto and Ernawati, 2018). Based on the potential and existing problems as expressed by Ernawati, Kusumoarto, and Jubei (2018) it is necessary to design and manage strategies as an effort to maintain the sustainability of the region as an ecotourism area. This area is part of the national park that has a distinctive character, so that management activities carried out need to pay attention to the landscape character. Kusumoarto, et al. (2017), stated that the natural resource conservation area as a protected area has a good of landscape character for ecotourism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Management of the Salak Mountain II Resort Area, HSNP is required by the Halimun Salak National Park Office (HSNPO), Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Republic of Indonesia to carry out activities to protect the area's ecosystems, prevent damage that occurs in the area, prevent land conversion, protect ecotourism activities carried out by visitors, arrange and protect ecotourism object facilities, protect visual quality of natural resources, and development and protection of accessibility. In conducting good management as towards the sustainability, it is necessary to structure the management of the Salak Mountain II Resort Area, HSNP. Structuring as the main objective of this research is based on the perceptions of experts so that it can be seen the institutional structure model of the management of the Salak Mountain II Resort Area, HSNP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Expert perceptions are included in the decision-making components of an individual person consisting of perception, attitude, value, preference, and satisfaction, where all components influence each other in taking decision (Porteous 1977). The perceptions of experts have a close relationship with their preferences so it is important to know and study perceptions and preferences in the framework of developing and managing </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font3">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">an area (Porteous 1977). Preference is the tendency to choose something that is preferred over others. According to Porteous (1977), studies of individual behavior can be used by environmentalists and designers to assess the desires of users (users) of a planned object.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Research Objectives</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The objectives in this study are 1) identifying elements in the management structure variables; 2) analyze the goals variable of ecotourism development, needs variable of ecotourism development, activity programs variable of ecotourism development, obstacles variable of ecotourism development, and actors variable of ecotourism development; 3) making the model of ecotourism management structuring.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>LITERATURE REVIEW</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Ecotourism is a tourism development model that respects natural rules by implementing integrated development and conservation programs between efforts to conserve natural resources with sustainable community economic development (Choy 1997; Fandelli 2000; Buchsbaum 2004; Gunn 1994; Avenzora 2008). Ecotourism activities are carried out in natural areas to </span><span class="font3">283 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e-ISSN: 2407-392X. p-ISSN: 2541-0857</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">get new experiences in carrying out their trips, usually carried out by visitors with a small amount (Gunn, 1994). Sustainable ecotourism is inspired by the concept of sustainable development. The concepts for achieving sustainable tourism destinations require ecological integration as an effort to achieve the vision of sustainable development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ISM analysis techniques are used to form alternative policies in the future. In practice this method is carried out in two stages. The first stage identified key stakeholders who were the most influential in developing ecotourism. The second stage, determines a number of key factors obtained from need analysis that are reviewed through expert discussion and based on theory in the ecotourism system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Preliminary information of stakeholders using the snawball method where stakeholders recommend other stakeholders as respondents (Dunn, 2003). After identifying and mapping stakeholders, further identification of the needs and aspirations of each stakeholder is carried out according to the priority scale (Storey, 1999). The needs and aspirations of each stakeholder are then discussed together with experts to get key stakeholders. Determination of experts is based on considerations and criteria: 1) existence, affordability, and willingness to be interviewed; 2) reputation, position, and </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font3">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">credibility as experts; 3) personal experience (Eriyatno and Sofyan, 2007). The main activities carried out are as follows: 1) identifying and mapping key stakeholders who are in compliance with regional management and evaluating the role and path capacity that can be played, 2) observing interests, conflicts, and the role of stakeholders in relations with resources, 3) identifying relationship between stakeholders to be built in an effort to produce an appropriate policy; 4) grouping stakeholders according to their interests and influence, 5) identifying existing institutions related to research, 6) identifying constraints related to ecotourism management.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>METHODOLOGY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This research was conducted in the Salak Mountain II Resort Area, HSNP. The study was conducted for 6 months, starting from June to November 2018. The method used in this study is descriptive qualitative with Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) analysis tools, with related elements, namely: 1) objectives to be achieved in managing the area , 2) needs in managing the area, 3) program activities needed, 4) constraints that need to be addressed, and 5) actors who play a role in managing ecotourism areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The stage of ISM analysis is the determination of contextual relationships which are then converted into mathematical &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relationships &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Rm).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Relations between elements fulfill reflexive and transitive properties (Machfud, 2001). In the process of transforming contextual relations (Matrix Structural Self-Interaction) into a form of mathematical relationship in the form of a Reachability matrix with complete rules can be seen in Table 1.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>The Objectives in the Management of Ecotourism Areas</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the results obtained through the Focus Group Discussion</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(FGD), there are several objectives to be achieved in managing this ecotourism area. The objectives achieved in developing ecotourism in the Salak Mountain II Resort Area, HSNP are: (1) development of tourist areas with the concept of ecotourism; (2) conservation of biological natural resources and their ecosystems; (3) utilization of natural resource potential; (4) protection of potential ecotourism objects; (5) protection of national vital objects; (6) provide education to the public about environmental management; (7) provide education to the public about the culture of the local community; (8) reducing the number and role of unlicensed local communities; (9) increasing the active role and independence of the community in ecotourism activities; (10) improve community welfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;Between one</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">objective with another objective has a contextual relationship that there is a contribution of objectives to one another and the objective of one with other objectives to contribute to each other. On the other hand there is a goal between one and the other not contributing to each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the &nbsp;ISM analysis</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">conducted showing that the goal of developing ecotourism &nbsp;in the Salak</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mountain II Resort Area, HSNP has the highest level of objectives, namely </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font3">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;287</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">reducing the number and role of unlicensed local communities. At the lowest level, the objective is to conserve biological natural resources and their ecosystems and provide education to the community about environmental management (Figure 1). There are similar parallels from the goal of developing this ecotourism area at the middle level, namely the aim of protecting the potential of ecotourism objects, protecting national vital objects and increasing the active role and independence of the community in ecotourism activities. In addition, the aim is to educate the public about the culture of the local community and improve community welfare.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/45761-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:202pt;height:237pt;">

<p><span class="font4">ecotourism development area is the effort to increase the active role of the community and the independence of the community in ecotourism activities very much depending on the 1st objective to the 8th objective. The objective of developing an ecotourism area is the effort to conserve natural resources and its ecosystem is a goal that has a very strong driving power but also needs strong support from other objectives. The objective of developing an ecotourism area is to provide education to the community about environmental management, a very strong driving power, but need to be supported by strong efforts from the 2nd objective and the 1st objective. The objective of developing an ecotourism area, namely the effort to reduce the number and role of unlicensed local communities, is an objective achievement that is supported by many other goals.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The Needs That Required in Management of Ecotourism Areas</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the results obtained through the FGD, there are some needs to be fulfilled in the management of this ecotourism area. The needs to be fulfilled in developing ecotourism in the Salak Mountain II Resort Area, HSNP are: (1) management institutions; (2) investors; (3) ecotourism master plan documents; (4) the </span><span class="font3">288 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e-ISSN: 2407-392X. p-ISSN: 2541-0857</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Based on ISM analysis, it shows that the need for the legality of ecotourism and cultural attractions has a very strong driving factor in the development of the Salak Mountain II Ecotourism area, HSNP. The need that is very dependent on other needs is the presence of investors, the existence of ecotourism master plan documents, the existence of marketing, and the existence of promotions. The need that has a fairly weak dependence on other needs is the existence of the legality of the ecotourism area, the existence of cultural attractions, the improvement of accessibility to ecotourism areas, an increase in skills and capacity of human resources for ecotourism management and the need for facilities and infrastructure (Figure 3). The existence of institutional management needs is a supportive need depending on other needs and enough to get encouragement from other needs, namely the third and eighth needs. This first need provides an impetus for achieving the fifth, sixth and seventh needs (Figure 4).</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Salak Mountain II Resort Ecotourism Area, HSNP is an area that has very interesting ecotourism objects. This condition requires good management towards a sustainable ecotourism area. The results of the focus group discussion (fgd) show that there are goals, constraints, needs and program activities in the development and management of the ecotourism area. In addition to providing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">good management, cooperation between actors is needed in the form of CoTourism Management.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The main goal in the development and management of the Salak Mountain II Resort Ecotourism Area, HSNP is the conservation of biological natural resources and their ecosystems and providing education to the public about environmental management. These two goals are the drivers of other very strong goals. The objectives to be achieved are also aimed at reducing the number of unlicensed area management communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the results of fgd, the legality of ecotourism areas and cultural attractions is needed. Cultural attractions are activities that are rarely carried out in this region. Both of these needs are strong drivers for other needs. Other needs namely improving accessibility to ecotourism areas; improving human resource skills and capacity for ecotourism management; and facilities and infrastructures are needs that are also powerful enough drivers for other needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the results of the fgd, there are several constraints as a strong driver for other constraints, namely the limited human resources that have the knowledge, skills and professionals in managing ecotourism as well as changing the status from utilization zone to the ecotourism zone. Marketing activities are </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font3">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">obstacles that are very dependent on other constraints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the results of fgd, there is an activity program that can be developed and managed in this ecotourism area, namely agro-tourism; local cultural and artistic attractions; ecotourism; nature recreation. These four activities are very powerful drivers and have links between one activity and other activities. Home stay lodging and souvenir sales, natural and cultural products are highly dependent on other activities</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the results of the fgd, there are actors of community leaders, non-governmental organizations, youth organizations, and investors who have very strong and not dependent motivating factors on other actors. The three actors who have a strong motivating factor and are the liaison between actors who do not depend on other actors with actors who depend on other actors namely Regional Planning, Development, and Research Agency of Bogor Regency Regional Government, Tourism and Culture Office of Bogor Regency Regional Government, and Environmental Office of Bogor Regency Regional Goverment. There are four actors who have very strong dependence on other actors namely the Higher Education Institution, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, and the</span></p>
