<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This paper aims at investigating the meaning of verb form ‘cook’ having one form with different manners of cooking something. Therefore, the analysis discusses about the various cooking manners in verb forms because cooking is an action or do something. The data was taken from the article about cooking procedure, by note taking technique. The data was further analyzed by natural semantics metalanguage. The result showed that verbs in cooking action have some similar meaning with different manners such as the manner cooking of blanch means cooking food into boiling water in a few minutes, while the manner cooking of steam means cooking food on the boiled water. Here, metalanguage manages to describe and analyze the verb meaning in cooking manners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Keywords</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">: metalanguage, verb</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">People life needs communication to convey their message, expression or action. To communicate the message especially in English, verb is needed to express and explain what the subject did. However, when people act or do something, they need verb to express the message. Therefore, verb can be found in sentences or in verbal language. Givon (1984) stated that verb divided into three categories, 1) state verb, 2) process verb, and 3) action verb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The various cooking manners that are verb include in the process and action verb because cooking is an action of doing the process of making delicious food. For instance, The English cooking manner of sauté means cook food in the oil or fat with over heat until the food is brown. Whereas, the cooking manner of deep-fry means an action of doing the process of fry food with much oil until the food are covered by the oil. Verb bear exists in English cooking manners interested to be analyzed because the same forms have different processes and results in cooking and serving the food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For Indonesian people, cooking has seven manners namely, goreng and tumis used for cooking food stuff in oil over heat, sangrai mostly cooks nuts or dry cereal without oil or fat and usually the pan made from clay, while rebus cooks food stuff into the boil water and kukus used to cook traditional snack, vegetables or another food stuff on the boiled water, bakar, and panggang used to grill meat, fish, bread or another food stuff using charcoal as fuel or grill on the frying pan. All of these types used to cook all kinds of food stuff only in different way without special food stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However in English, the cooking manners have each own way with a special food stuff. For instance the verb “toasted” used to cook bread warmly</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and brown in high heat (Walter, 2008), while the verb “roast” used to cook meat at the oven. Therefore, the various cooking manners interested to be analyzed because in Indonesia and English have each own way to mention the cooking manners with different way specially. So, the theory uses to analyze the differences meaning and process of cooking manners in English by metalanguage analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">II MATERIALS AND METHOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The data will be analyzed in this paper in the form of verb words. It is taken from the article about cooking procedure. The article discusses the various ways and processes of English people cook the food. Besides, the article contains a lot of verb bear with difference processes and results of cooking food. Here, the collected data will be classified based on the way the object work or process the thing, the tools and the food stuff used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The data above will be analyzed by using metalanguage to describe and to analyze the configuration about the verbs in the lexicon used in cooking manners. In addition, the NSM approach used to explain the semantic primitive data besides NSM concept can use in a concrete and abstract concept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Wierzbicka (2010:14) defined semantic primitive is indefinable and the basis on which the semantic system of a language was built. Moreover, Goddard (1996:2) stated that semantic primitive cannot be changed as it is innate nature of meaning. Then Semantic primitives are a search for understanding because without it, the meaning cannot be described. People may have different perception to recognize the meaning. Therefore, sometimes the meaning of something can be clear to someone but it may not be clear to another, and when the concept is known by someone sometimes it can be unknown concept to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here, Wierzbicka (2010) found several semantic primitives which consist of some exponents as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Based on the categories of exponent, this analysis is included in actions/events/movement. Someone who cooks is doing an activity by moving the tool and touching the food stuff mix together into the pan or frying pan to make a delicious dish or meal.</span></p>
