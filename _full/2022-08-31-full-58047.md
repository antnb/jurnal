<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">This study was intended to identify the verbal sign used in the music video This Is America by Childish Gambino. This study applied a qualitative library research approach. Based on that approach, the data were drawn according to the theories applied in this study. The data was collected by note taking technique and documentation methods. The first theory implemented was the verbal sign proposed by Dyer. It was applied to analyze the verbal sign in the music video. The second theory appealed was the theory of meaning proposed by Leech to analyze the meaning used in the music video. The results revealed that the meaning of the lyrics refers to the African American society’s predicament of racism, police brutality, violence and gun possession. The lyrics contained the connotative and conceptual meaning.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Language is a system of functional differences and oppositions. It can be in the form of a spoken or written communication media used by human beings to deliver their thought, idea, and feelings. Foley (1997:27) stated that language is usually defined as a system of signs and their rules of combination. The study about the system of signs and the whole thing which involve in meaning as a part of communication known as semiotics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">De Saussure declared that semiotics is a science that studies the role of signs as a part of social life and it also would be a part of social psychology, and general psychology (cited in Chandler, 2002:2). In semiotics, a sign is simply a signal that people can receive via senses,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and can interpret these signals in a way that gives them meaning. Peirce (193158,2.172) stated that anything can be a sign as long as someone interprets it as ‘signifying’ something and referring to something other than itself. A sign has two characteristics; signifier and signified. The signifier is usually interpreted as the material (or physical) form of the sign – it is something which can be seen, heard, touched, smelled, or tasted – it can be in the form of a word, sound, or the image itself. The signified is somewhere between ‘a mental image, a concept and a psychological reality ‘(Eco 1976, 14-15).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Signifier and signified can be found in a sign. In conclusion, a sign is a combination of a signifier with a particular signified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Generally, a sign can be divided into two different parts which are visual and verbal signs. The visual sign refers to the picture. Visual sign in the communication process is delivered through gesture, appearance, facial expressions presented in the form of images and carry meanings. Meanwhile, verbal sign is related to the word or phrase that implies meanings and in the form of oral or written text. Signs can be seen in any aspect of life, including in the music video.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The combination of songs and pictures is a music video. People and music could be defined in economic terms of demand and supply or cause and effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nowadays, the demand of a music video has taken high interest of the public along with the explosion of data and topic which easily caught the world attention. Video communication such as music video further fits the need of consumers-most consumers read much less and rather prefer to watch a video (Insivia, 2006). Music videos often supply with public’s desire or the situation in the society nowadays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America</span><span class="font4"> was released by Donald Glover under his musical moniker Childish Gambino. The main reason for choosing this music video because real-world referents with the fact that there are so many hidden signs imply America’s problem nowadays such as racism, gun violence, discrimination between white and black people and injustice. The content of the song lyric is meaningful and supported the music video in a lot of aspects. Thus, the verbal sign is an interesting object concerns to analyse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the introduction above, this study was aimed to find the verbal sign found in the music video.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>METHOD AND THEORY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Research method is a procedure used to do scientific writing. The methodology</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">used in analyzing the data in this research includes the following points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The data of this study was taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America</span><span class="font4"> music video. It is a song published by a well-known American rapper Childish Gambino as well-known as Donald Glover and with the help of Ludwig Goransson as the writer and producer. It was debuted on May 5<sup>th</sup> 2018 during the Saturday Night Live which was hosted by Childish Gambino. Hiro Murai as the lead director of the music video had received more than 13 million views within 24 hours span and has over 385 million views as of September 2018. This music video has depth and used imagery to frame and highlight the major issues in America. Thus, the verbal sign portrayed in the music video became interesting to analyse and relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In collecting the data, this study used documentation method and note-taking technique. First, the music video </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This is America&quot;</span><span class="font4"> was chosen and downloaded from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YouTube</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search"><span class="font4">https://www.youtube.com/results?search</span></a><span class="font4"> _query=this+is+america; then, the music video played repeatedly and intensively to understand the verbal sign that can be found in the music video. Third, the data noted down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The collected data was analysed by using a qualitative method. There were several steps to analyse the data. First, the data found in the music video analysed by using the theory of verbal sign proposed by Dyer and also the theory of meaning by Leech. Third, rechecked the analysis found after collecting all these data. Finally, crosscheck the results found according to the classifications and applied theories. Lastly, the results were descriptively presented in an informal method.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Review of Literatures</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">In the literature review, some studies had been conducted and have a similar topic to the current study. Those studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">were reviewed to support the process of this study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The research proposed by Petrilli (2007) discussed a phenomenological and semiotic analysis of sensibility, or feeling, in the era of globalization which is the era of global communication: how are such things as time, space, self, others, life, death, etc perceived in today’s world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The study proposed by Umagandhi (2017) discussed the Leech’s seven types of meaning in semantics which are conceptual meaning, connotative meaning, social and affective meaning, reflected and collective meaning, associative meaning and thematic meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Meanwhile, communication’s medium influences distance preferences, such that people’s preference for communicating a message to a distant (vs. proximal) target is greater for verbal compared with pictorial communications (Trope, 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Verbal sign in advertisements consists of words that do not only describe things, communicate feelings and associate attitudes, but also bring ideas to your mind (Candra, 2019).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A research statement shows that a verbal cue in the form of hearing a word can influence even the most elementary visual processing and inform our understanding of how language affects perception Spivey (2020). Najafian (2011) stated that a sign can also represent meaning about the social relations of those engaged in communication, the interpersonal function. Li (2008) proposed in his study that social semiotics and multimodal discourse are suggested in facilitating these processes of deconstruction to address several controversial issues presented in the packaging. Other studies proposed by Klimesch (1982) stated that visual characteristics are better retained if targets have been verbalized. Negm (2015) in his research stated that the use</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of imagery impacts costumers’ perception because it increases recall, enhances attitude toward the promoted matter, and affects behavioral intentions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other studies proposed by Prawiranatha (2018) stated that verbal and visual signs are related to one another, verbal sign as the part that describes what is meant by visual sign and the visual sign as the part that illustrates what is meant by the verbal sign. Nugraha (2019) stated that the relation between verbal and visual signs can be seen as the verbal signs supporting the presentation of the visualsigns by adding any information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some previous studies (e.g. Sumanjaya, 2015; Windiyawati, 2011; Pidada, 2008) mainly discuss verbal and visual signs. Meanwhile, the current study only used a verbal sign.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Theory of Semiotic</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">The term ‘semiotic’ is derived from Greek ‘semeion’ which means sign. Semiotics is the study of signs. Saussure (cited in Chandler, 2001) defines semiotics as the science of the file of sign in society. However, this study is only focused on the verbal sign as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Verbal Sign</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Proposed by Dyer (1993:34), verbal sign representation in a medium of audio. Dyer argued in his statements:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Different people ‘read’ and interpret texts in different ways, and it is possible to ask different groups of consumers how they interpret or understand a specific text” (1986:87).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Dyer (1986:87) that there are two ways to identify the meaning of a text which are: non-textual analysis and textual analysis. The nontextual analysis is used to identify the meaning by asking the producer/author the meaning. Meanwhile, textual analysis is used to identify the meaning based on interpreter perspectives.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Theory of Meaning</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">According to Leech (1981: 9), meaning can be classified into seven types, however, this study focused only on conceptual and connotative meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Conceptual Meaning</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Leech (1981: 9), the conceptual meaning is widely assumed to be a central factor in linguistic communication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Connotative Meaning</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Leech (1981: 12), the connotative meaning is the communicative value an expression has by virtue what it refers to, over and above its purely conceptual content.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">As proposed by Dyer (1993) that verbal sign relates to the portrayal of visual communication which will show how people communicate. The music video has complex analysis in term of the meaning of the song lyrics. Thus, this relation often created such a component such as pictures, idea executions, relationship and personal feelings associated with the productions. As complex as it sounds, the meaning analysed based on Leech’s theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Meanings of Verbal Sign Contained in The Song Lyrics of Childish Gambino’s Music Video </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">This Is America</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on Leech (1981) statement in his book Semantics The Study of Meaning stated that meaning has its linguistic phenomenon which can be recognized through its relations of meaning. Further analysis of verbal signs can be seen as follows. These lyrics taken from official website of Genius.com of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Intro (Choir)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The songs revealed with a gospel choir. Gospel originally attains from old</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">English which are (good) spell (news, message). Those words combined as ‘good news’. Its originality comes from American South during the era of servitude. This Intro lyric taken from official website of Genius.com of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America</span><span class="font4"> produced by Ludwig Goransson &amp;&nbsp;Childish Gambino.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[4-1] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yeah, yeah, yeah, go, go away</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the intro lyrics of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America</span><span class="font4">, it can be observed that the words </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘go away’</span><span class="font4"> are part of conceptual meaning. As Leech stated that this conceptual meaning will help to distinguish the meaning of a word. The choir inferring that the listeners can just </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘go away’</span><span class="font4"> and don’t give any consideration as there isn’t any predicament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bridge</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This bridge lyric taken from official website of Genius.com of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America</span><span class="font4"> produced by Ludwig Goransson &amp;&nbsp;Childish Gambino. The bridge verse of This Is America below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[4-2] &nbsp;We just wanna party</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Party just for you</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We just want the money Money just for you (Yeah) I know you wanna party Party just for free</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Girl, you got me dancin' (Girl, you got me dancin')</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dance and shake the frame (Yeah)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Further, the first line of the verse in this conceptual meaning is the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">party</span><span class="font4">. As Leech have stated that this conceptual meaning is essential part to learn the meaning. The word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">party</span><span class="font4"> means a cultural celebration at which a group of people meets to talk, eat, drink, dance, often to commemorate a particular occasion. Following that, in the data, the lines </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">we just want the money</span><span class="font4"> in this conceptual meaning is the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">money </span><span class="font4">that means coins or notes that are used to purchase items. Last but not least in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">bridge part are the words </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shake</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">frame</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font4">In this case, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shake</span><span class="font4"> means when the body performs quick short movement and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the frame</span><span class="font4"> indicates the size and shape of someone’s body. The lines say </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">dance and shake the frame</span><span class="font4"> is to move one’s body in the party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Chorus</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This chorus lyric taken from official website of Genius.com of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America</span><span class="font4"> produced by Ludwig Goransson &amp;&nbsp;Childish Gambino.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[4-3] This is America</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don't catch you slippin' now Don't catch you slippin' now Look what I'm whippin' now</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this chorus verse, the second line of the verse consists of connotative meaning. This means, in other words, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">do not catch you making a mistake</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font4">This is addressed to the injustices of police brutality in America and ignorance of acts or hate. The line of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">look what I’m whippin now</span><span class="font4"> also consists of connotative meaning as it does not merely mean the punishment of being hit in this song. It explains that look at what one’s making. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘I’</span><span class="font4"> here refers to Childish Gambino as he misled the pollical difficulties of America and the gun violence that happened by formulating engaging lyrics and choreography moves of African-Americans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Verse 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This verse 1 lyric taken from official website of Genius.com of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America</span><span class="font4"> produced by Ludwig Goransson &amp;&nbsp;Childish Gambino.The first verse of This is America shown as below: [4-4] This is America (Skrrt, skrrt) Don't catch you slippin' now (Ayy) Look how I'm livin' now Police be trippin' now (Woo)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Above verse, the third line of the verse is a conceptual meaning. This line has a blatant purpose of asserting the facts of prevailing as a black man in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">America. The data in Verse 1 lyrics, the last line has connotative meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[4-5] Yeah, this is America</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Woo, ayy)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Guns in my area (Word, my area)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I got the strap (Ayy, ayy)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I gotta carry 'em</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yeah, yeah, I'ma go into this</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The data above, the second line showed conceptual meaning. Gambino goes on addressing gun ownership and gun violence. In the next line of the lyric, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I got the strap</span><span class="font4"> is the connotative meaning of the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">strap</span><span class="font4">. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘Strap’</span><span class="font4"> is a slang used to soften the image of the real peril of guns. Americans glorify owning of a gun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The last two lines of the verse are conceptual meaning. Based on the lyrics, Gambino validated about his gun ownership that he obliges carry one due to the environmental influence around him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[4-6] Yeah, yeah, this is guerilla (Woo)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Further, into the verse, connotative meaning showed in the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">guerrilla</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">. </span><span class="font4">There are two references for this is guerrilla. The first reference is an interpretation of guerrilla warfare and the other is a theory connected to the invisible gorilla-experiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[4-7] Yeah, yeah, I'ma go get the bag</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yeah, yeah, or I'ma get the pad Yeah, yeah, I'm so cold like, yeah I'm so dope like, yeah (Woo)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We gon' blow like, yeah (Straight up, uh)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The interpretation of getting </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘the bag’</span><span class="font4"> is the connotative meaning of an implication of getting of money from rapping and if Gambino doesn’t, he will require to go back to his </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pad</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">paper </span><span class="font4">and resume on writing to be able to earn some money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Refrain</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This refrain lyric taken from official website of Genius.com of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America</span><span class="font4"> produced by Ludwig Goransson &amp;&nbsp;Childish Gambino</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font4"> This part also can</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">be apprehended in the gospel choir. In the music video, the choir was a representation of black people’s life collectively and die together to fight against injustices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[4-8] Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, tell somebody</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You go tell somebody Grandma told me</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Get your money, Black man The </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘tell somebody’</span><span class="font4"> part is connotative meaning based Leech theory is concern with the communicative value that the word has Therefore, it symbolizes the necessity of the black people to continue to vocalize the rights that they deserve to possess. The line </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>i</sup>get your money’</span><span class="font4"> is to get respect from society by being financially successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Verse 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This verse 2 lyrics taken from official website of Genius.com of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America</span><span class="font4"> produced by Ludwig Goransson &amp;&nbsp;Childish &nbsp;Gambino</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font4"> &nbsp;This verse</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">emphasizes the superficial, consumerist society that people endure nowadays. [4-9] Look how I'm geekin' out (Hey)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I'm so fitted (I'm so fitted, woo)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I'm on Gucci (I'm on Gucci)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I'm so pretty (Yeah, yeah, woo)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I'm gon' get it (Ayy, I'm gon' get it) Watch me move (Blaow)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Above verse, the first line is connotative meaning. This word is translated to the real word terms by using Leech theory. In this case, Gambino is very engaged in bringing racism to the entire world by producing a music video and getting the message out to the public. Continuous to the verse, have connotative meaning. As many events and incidents happened in America and mimicked in the music video, simply having bunch of cash and obtaining a greater status doesn’t dilute the African American people from racial attitudes and treatments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[4-10] This a celly (Ha)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That's a tool (Yeah)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There are several significant connotative words in this verse. A </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">band</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">’ </span><span class="font4">means thousand dollars, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hunnid bands’ </span><span class="font4">is a hundred thousand dollars, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">contraband’</span><span class="font4"> is goods that have been illegaly smuggled, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Oaxaca’</span><span class="font4"> is a state in Mexico which well-known of its various narcotic thing, a ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">plug</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">’ </span><span class="font4">relates to a drug merchant and ‘</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">blocka</span><span class="font4">’ signifies the tone of a gun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Refrain</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This refrain lyrics taken from official website of Genius.com of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America</span><span class="font4"> produced by Ludwig Goransson &amp;&nbsp;Childish Gambino</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font4"> Gambino was dancing on an old pile of rummage cars with SZA appearing and was sitting on the canopy of a car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[4-12] Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, tell somebody</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">America, I just checked my following list, and You go tell somebody</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You mothafuckas owe me</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this refrain verse</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font4">the first line has connotative meaning. The next line verse, has conceptual meaning. Leech stated</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">that the conceptual meaning provides the interpretation of a sentence. The word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tell </span><span class="font4">means to say something to someone, often providing them information or guidance. This supported by the last line of the verse, which has conceptual meaning. Gambino portrays </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">owe </span><span class="font4">here as, over the last few years, this awareness should transpire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Outro</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This outro lyrics taken from official website of Genius.com of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America</span><span class="font4"> produced by Ludwig Goransson &amp;&nbsp;Childish Gambino</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font4"> The outro is the last section of the song’s structure. In the line </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">you just a black man in this world </span><span class="font4">has conceptual meaning. It notifies us Gambino feels concerning his status as an African American citizen today which supported the conceptual meaning by Leech. The next line is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">you just a barcode, drivin’ expensive foreigns</span><span class="font4"> have connotative meaning. This reinforces the pursuit of material gain and financial freedom become the focus of African American and again it has done only little to give them the true meaning of liberty and prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[4-13] You just a big dawg, yeah</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I kenneled him in the backyard</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No, probably ain't life to a dog For a big dog</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Connotative meaning can be seen in this whole verse of lyrics</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">. The first line of the verse </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Big dawg</span><span class="font4"> means one who does everything essentially well and doesn’t take any crap from anyone. The rest of the lines in the verse have really strong connotative meaning and become the important lines to end the outro of the song. Gambino used the slang term to claim that black man treated such a lesser class and simply pushed to be treated as less than human.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>CONCLUSIONS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">According to the analysis that have been carefully studied, the conclusion of this study can be conclude as follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The lyric of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America </span><span class="font4">containing the connotative and conceptual meaning. These two meanings carry messages to present to the public the conflict within the singer and African American culture. Childish Gambino overall message is to not allow the entertainment, social media, current popular culture distract the existing obstacles of African American society facing every day. Thus, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Is America</span><span class="font4"> itself stimulates the lyric and the viewers can understand that the message and the meaning of the whole concept of the music video itself.</span></p>
