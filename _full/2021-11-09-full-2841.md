Cationic porphyrins and their interactions with DNA have become an important concern due to its role as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy for cancer treatment However this therapy technique has the disadvantage ie its inability to document photographically the fluorescence observed endoscopically The present research aims to observe the change in molecular level of cationic porphyrins which labeled by radionuclides emitting  particle and  radiation
