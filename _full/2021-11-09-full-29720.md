It is usually used in some works such as novel, song or movie. The reason why a moviemaker used the taboo words in their movies is that a fiction story, because</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">it supports the role of the whole movies and necessary for the story. Some of Hollywood movies are also use some taboo expression in their dialog, like those in “Men in Black 2 and 3” Movie. These movie are chosen as a data source because there was found a lots of taboo expressions in dialogues that express of anger, humor, dissatisfaction, and shocked feelings something from one character to another.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In this conversation, Kay and Jay came to a party to meet Mr. Warhol. However, Mr. Warhol refused to talk and give them the desired information. Jay and Kay were forced to drag Mr. Warhol into a clothing room. Dragged by force by Kay and Jay, Mr. Warhol angry with them. Moreover, they tried to dismantle the real identity of Mr. Warhol as a spy agent. Kay apologized and told that they have no intention to dismantle his identity and will definitely keep secret of Mr. Warhol identity being a spy agent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr. Warhol are certainly still highly upset called Jay as a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Dumbass&quot;</span><span class="font1">. Jay certainly not accept the words by Mr. Warhol and they started to have an argument. Kay tried to stop their argument and told Jay to wait in the outside. In this situation, Warhol said </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Dumb-Ass” </span><span class="font1">repeatedly. Word </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Ass” </span><span class="font1">refers to obscene part of taboo word.

In this context </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Dumb-Ass” </span><span class="font1">has the same meaning as a loser.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In the third data tell that Jay looking for Kay and he meet agent O, she said Kay was died in 40 years ago. Jay insisted that Kay are not died, he remembered that last night he met with Kay. Then, someone give chocolate milk for Jay. Agent O feeling weird towards Jay and ask how long he began to consume dairy products like it. Agent O suspicious of Jay, she tells Jay that he may have been bitten by tick in his brain. Instantly agent O hitting Jay head and he screamed in pain. Agent O feels that endured by Jay is not due to a tick, but caused by something else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Taboo expression generally more dominant using by men in their conversation. However, sometimes women using taboo expression and paste it in sentence that their when they spoke. This is occurs because they can feel upset over an incident that they experienced. This also can occur because not all women have a sense of humor like a man. It means that a few of women are not like men that loving joke. In this context, Agent O uses the phrase inadvertently, it is because she felt that his guess was incorrectly due to concern about Agent J is not caused by tick brain.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the analysis, the following concluding points are developed to be final stage of writing. There are nine types of Taboo Expression are found in the ‘Men in Black’ movie, such as: Cursing, Profanity, Taboo, Obscenity, Vulgarity, Slang, Epithets, Insult and slur, Scatology. There are found some taboo expression after analyzing ‘Men in Black’ movie, those are; Damn, Bitch, Son of Bitch, Goddamn, Stupid, Dog, Pee, Tick, Bastard, God’s Sake, Jesus, Ass, Dumb-ass, Ball, Dude, Fellas, Hell, Shit, .The context when the taboo expression are generally uttered in the movie are stated in informal conditions. Expression when words taboo warn, refused, emotional, and insulting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Expression taboo are often shown in this movie tends to expressed by the male characters than women characters. Men typically use taboo words in this movie conversation. This due to the higher portion of the male character in the dialogue movie of their role as main character. In addition to their role as the main character, the use of the word taboo for men sounds masculine and tough when using those words.</span></p>
