<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">One way that can be done to analyze cyber security equipment is by monitoring the logs it generates. Meanwhile, to be able to analyze the logs generated from each equipment requires a long time and has a high level of difficulty. When the management of the cyber security system is not going right, it causes the failure of the cyber security system. So a defense mechanism is needed on managing the log called Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) using Alienvault OSSIM tools. Threat Monitoring or monitoring of security threats in the Cyber world, is used to analyze, evaluate, and monitor network threats and as an end point for organizations to provide evidence of security threats, such as network intrusions, data exfiltration, ransomware and other malware attacks. The limitations of the problems carried out in this study were limited to Threat Monitoring using Alienvault OSSIM. There are 6 servers at the Udayana University Information Resources Unit (USDI) that are being monitored. Monitoring was carried out for 3 months. There were 230,622 Events or events that were collected as a whole. IT assets that have the most logs during monitoring are owned by DNS Servers with a total of 200,424 Events. There are 11 Event Names and 34 event logs that are discussed. The log is packaged in the form of a report along with an explanation, of course it can assist administrators in evaluating their IT assets. There is also an email notification feature using Gmail. Overall there are no attacks that are so significant with the low risk category. Alienvault OSSIM is proven to be able to carry out monitoring processes in real time properly and can help USDI to monitor the activities of its IT assets.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Efforts to improve cyber security or network security are essential. However, due to the large number of network security devices or IT assets being used, more and more equipment is being managed. Assets such as networks, devices and applications must be managed, analyzed and managed with security data to remain safe and function according to their function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One way to improve cyber security is to analyze IT equipment by monitoring the logs generated from the equipment. Analyzing the logs produced from each piece of equipment takes a long time and is difficult. When the management of the cyber security system does not run well, it causes cyber security system failure. So, a defence mechanism is needed to manage logs called Security Information and Event Management (SIEM). Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a technology that correlates logs, events, distributed systems and services with a security baseline (Datacomm Cloud, 2017). The strength of SIEM is its ability to understand logs or events generated by devices, software and hardware, monitor, analyze and correlate them to detect cyber attacks and then provide notifications in the form of alarms or alerts. One of the tools that uses the SIEM mechanism is Alienvault OSSIM (Open Source Security Information and Event Management).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Udayana University Information Resources Unit (USDI) is an agency that provides computer facilities, broad communications, and Information Technology needs used by Udayana University Lecturers, Staff and Students. Currently, USDI does not have applications or security tools to carry out Threat Monitoring, especially SIEM-based. Additionally, USDI does not yet have an application that can manage logs and provide notifications automatically because USDI is still manual in reading server logs. There was a hack on a server owned by USDI. It is suspected that the cause was due to a backdoor file stored in the USDI directory. So implementing Threat Monitoring using Alienvault OSSIM on USDI is very important so that security or network administrators can get early notification if there are indications of attacks or anomalies occurring on USDI's servers so that they can take precautions. Apart from that, security or network administrators can find out what activities are carried out by monitored IT assets. Therefore, a SIEM-based Threat Monitoring tool, namely Alienvault OSSIM, was implemented at the Information Resources Unit (USDI) at Udayana University.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In this research, there are several stages that need to be carried out. These stages are carried out sequentially and when one stage is completed, they immediately move on to the next stage. The following is a picture of the flow of the research method used in this research.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/109223-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:384pt;height:74pt;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Figure 1 </span><span class="font3">Research Methods</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Figure 1 is the process of the research methodology that will be carried out. This research starts from Information Gathering, Threat Monitoring, Assessment, to Conclusion. Research will be carried out from stage one to the next stage. The research begins by conducting an Information Gathering (Information Gathering) with related agencies, collecting information in the form of introducing the environment, network structure, collecting the number of assets that will be monitored, apart from that it can also be in the form of collecting data about problems related to the assets or agencies. Next there will be a Threat Monitoring process, where the Alienvault OSSIM installation and configuration process will be carried out, until the monitoring process lasts for 3 months. Next, an assessment process will be carried out on the results of the monitoring. Assessment of results in the form of events or events related to the assets being monitored. In addition, data processing analysis will be carried out based on these events. Next, the Conclusion process will be carried out, in the form of making conclusions based on the assessment and data processing process from events or monitoring during the 3 months.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literature Study</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The literature review discusses theories related to writing research reports.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 SIEM</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Security Information and Event Management or SIEM is a tool used to monitor and analyze network traffic in real time. The data analyzed is in the form of logs generated by the device or application. In addition, SIEM tools function as a means of detecting potential attacks and tracking intrusion paths. SIEM can also be said to be a log management system. The reason is that SIEM collects data or logs from various points, such as databases, firewalls, servers, networks, and so on. SIEM makes it possible to record various events and their correlation from all existing sources.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Allienvault OSSIM or Open Source Security Information and Event Management is an Open Source System (SIEM) tool, which integrates selected tools designed to help network administrators in Computer Security, Intrusion Detection, and Prevention. OSSIM is intended to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">provide security analysis and give Administrators a more complete view of all aspects of their system security, by combining extensible log management with plugins and asset management and discovery with information from specific information security control and detection systems. This information is then correlated together to create context for the information that would not be apparent from any one part alone. Alarm displays and availability views along with reporting capabilities are provided to enhance the tool's capabilities and usability for security and systems engineers. The Allienvault OSSIM tool uses various types of sensors to monitor data, including Snort, Ntop, Openvas, P0f (Passive OS Detection), Pads, Arpwatch (Mac change anomalies), OSSEC (IDS for Host level), Osiris, Nagios and OCS (Inventory), these sensors are used to monitor events originating from remote hosts using the Syslog protocol. This development was carried out with the aim of preventing attacks based on attack patterns aimed at the system.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Threat Monitoring or monitoring security threats in the cyber world, is used to analyze, evaluate and monitor network threats and as an end point for organizations to provide evidence of security threats, such as network intrusion, data exfiltration, ransomware and other malware attacks. Once a threat is identified, threat monitoring software issues an alert and stops the threat. Threat Monitoring provides visibility into the network for Security Engineers and provides actions to users who access it. Threat Monitoring can provide stronger data protection and prevent or reduce damage caused by breaches. Companies are now hiring Security Engineers for Threat Monitoring to avoid additional risks to company data and sensitive information, as well as encourage monitoring of security threats in the company.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Meanwhile, carrying out this research requires several devices in the form of hardware and software that can be used to carry out the monitoring process. The following are several tools used to conduct Implementation research (SIEM) for IT Asset Monitoring Using Alienvault OSSIM as follows.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">3.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardware Requirements</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Hardware is all types of components in a computer device that have a physical form, can be seen, touched and felt. The main function of hardware is to provide support for the main function of a computer, such as input, processing, output, secondary storage and communication (Napizahni, 2023). The following is some of the hardware used in conducting final assignment research entitled Implementation (SIEM) for IT Asset Monitoring Using Alienvault OSSIM as follows.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alienvault OSSIM Architecture</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">In a good application design, one of the things that must be considered is the information architecture. Information architecture will help users to find the information they need more easily and quickly. An application is said to have good information architecture if the application organizes information well and is structured. In this way, users will not get lost in the application when they need information, and will get the information they need quickly. The following is the architecture of Alienvault OSSIM.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/109223-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:363pt;height:154pt;">

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Figure 3 </span><span class="font3">Alienvault OSSIM Architecture</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Figure 3 is the architecture implemented in Alienvault OSSIM. Based on this architecture, it is divided into 4 main parts, namely Monitored Assets, Alienvault OSSIM Sensors, Alienvault OSSIM Server, and Browsers. The stages carried out by Alienvault OSSIM are based on this structure, such as monitoring and collection processes for monitored assets or taking events in the form of logs on monitored assets which are carried out by sensors owned by Alienvault OSSIM using a TCP/UDP connection with a certain port. Next, after going through the event retrieval or collection process, the event is given by the sensor to the Alienvault OSSIM Server. This process is also carried out using a TCP/UDP connection with a specific port. After the event arrives at the Alienvault OSSIM Server, a process of checking the correlation of the event with other events, the event with the event originating system, the event with the time of occurrence, and the event with other attributes is carried out. After the event correlation process has been successful, an administrator can access or obtain this information via a browser with a device connected directly to Alienvault OSSIM. This process uses a TCP connection using port 80, namely the HTPP protocol, and port 443, namely the HTTPS protocol. After this process, an administrator can carry out the monitoring process in real time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Table 7 is a collection of recommendations given to the case study agency, namely the Udayana University Information Resources Unit (USDI). The 10 recommendations given have been implemented during the monitoring process. There is one recommendation that has not been implemented, namely implementing Port Mirroring with the aim of activating NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) so that later Alienvault OSSIM can work more optimally in carrying out the threat monitoring process.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Based on data processing or previous discussions, the author draws the following conclusions. The implementation was successful by installing Alienvault OSSIM on a server owned by USDI and able to connect to the asset you wanted to monitor. Monitoring was carried out on 6 IT assets, where all Linux-based assets consisted of the SSH Gateway Server Agent, SERVER UNIT VM 11, Web Unit 6 VM 12, Web 2 VM 12, DNS Server, and Radius Server (WIFI). Alienvault OSSIM can work in real time 24/7. So it can minimize negligence and help administrators who cannot monitor the IT assets they own 24 hours a day. There is an email notification feature on Gmail if there is an attack or there are logs that have previously been set in policy. This feature is certainly very helpful for an administrator to monitor the activities of the IT assets he owns. Apart from that, it can also help administrators obtain information about incidents on IT assets that are being monitored so that prevention can be carried out quickly and precisely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The total number of events collected was 230,622 events. The IT asset that has the most logs during monitoring is owned by the DNS Server with a total of 200,424 Events. Based on this, it can be concluded that the DNS Server is the busiest IT asset during the monitoring process. Apart from that, there are 11 Event Names and 34 event logs which are used as reports with explanations and risks during the monitoring process. There are 12 recommendations that have been given in order to increase USDI's level of security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The overall final result is based on the logs collected after the monitoring process, there are no attacks, threats, or risks that are very significant or dangerous for the relevant IT assets. No Alert detected. The overall risk category is in the low category.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The impact of implementing Alienvault OSSIM on USDI as a threat monitoring tool is being able to set User Authorization when using the server, being able to help Administrators in reading logs and monitoring servers, Gmail notifications can be integrated on mobile phones so that they can help administrators find out about an incident and can take preventative steps (prevention). Apart from that, Alienvault OSSIM on USDI will continue to be used and continued by USDI.</span></p>
