<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not a lot of research related to the determinants that influence delegates to participate in an event. This research is related to a number of factors that influence delegates who are tourism business key players when participating in a tourism event as the case is JITM 2019 which held at Yogyakarta. These factos are including accessibility, event organizer, accommodation, venue, and perceived of prices. By observing on 100 respondent who were buyer at the event and by using classical assumption test, it was found that these five factors i.e accessibility, event organizer, accommodation, venue, and perceived of prices were indeed proven to significantly influence the decision to participate in the event. Accomodation is the most influential factor, as for the details discussed in this paper.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In general, people participating in an event are determined by many factors. However, there are specific factors that are often associated with organizing events and have an influence on participants' motivation to attend the event. These factors included 1) adequate accessibility, 2) tourist attractions, 3) amenities, and 4) human resources and stakeholder support. More specifically, it is stated in the attractions section that the concern for this factor is meeting facilities, exhibition facilities, accommodation, and interesting places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For most delegates participating in an event is an opportunity to go leisure, seek and discover a new, unusual experience (G. Bowdin, 2012). Motivation for interest in an activity at a destination is</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">closely related to the overall satisfaction. It is related to personal factors, both factors psychological aspects (cognitive) and those related to physical aspects (affective) (Francisco et al., 2019). Psychological aspects such as perceptions of destination, image, attractiveness, quality of service, and other preferred attributes. On the physical aspect, it includes the venue for the event, accessibility to the event location, accommodation, and amenities that make it easy for tourists or event organizers. In addition, individual interest in a destination also depends on how a destination is able to provide good service to visitors (Disegna and Osti, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In accordance with the event, there is still very little research that examines the factors related to motivation and delegation decisions in participating in the event. Even though MICE event is considered to be a prospective and profitable business, it</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">is not easy to attract the interest of the participants. It can be mentioned such as 1) unusual venues such as unique and spectacular places, 2) intensive promotions through a number of media, 3) good services provided by management, 5) availability of accommodation (</span><a href="http://www.Venue-Seeker.com"><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">www.Venue-Seeker.com</span></a><span class="font4">, 2019). All of them will not simply be a factor of attraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been mentioned in the above description that individual or company participation in an event is multifactor rather than just one factor. Accordingly, this study is an attempt to examine a number of factors which are thought to have a major influence in the decision to participate in a number of business events in Yogyakarta. The selection of these factors is based on a number of empirical studies from a number of existing studies. The case taken was at the implementation of the 2019 Jogja International Travel Mart (JITM) which was attended by 130 domestic and foreign buyers. JITM has been regularly held annually by the Government of D.I Yogyakarta as a travel mart event that brings together tourism business actors in Yogyakarta with a number of buyers from abroad or from outside Yogyakarta. The sellers are local tourism business actors which include hotel and other accommodation services, travel agents, organizers, tour operator, airlines, and cargo service providers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Research Objectives</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This study aims to examine the number of factors that are supposed to affect the participation decisions of the delegates with special case at JITM event. Those factors which will be evaluated are accessibility, event organizer, accommodation, venue, and (perceived) of price. The tests will be carried out to find out which factors have the most influence.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Literature Review and Hypotheses Development</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There are many factors that may affect the feasibility of a MICE destination as well as factors that attract delegates when participating in a MICE event. This research simply focuses on aspects of accessibility, event organizer, accommodation, venue, and price. The reason is of course adjusting to the characteristics of the destinations that are the research locations in Yogyakarta. As the destination of MICE Tourism, Yogyakarta still has a number of limitations in terms of access, professionalism in organizing events and venues, but has advantages in the availability of accommodation and very affordable in prices.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Accesibility as a Factor for Buyer Decision</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A classic book written by Geofrrey Crouch and Ritchie (1998) has produced a number of criteria that are commonly used by a number of decision makers in the association and meeting planners are attributes such as: 1) Accessibility, 2) Local Support, 3) Extra support during the conference, 4) Accommodation Facilities, 5) Meeting Facilities, 6) Information, 7) The environment of the meeting location. On another occasion other criteria have been put forward by Nadkarni and Wai (2007) Critical attributes that influence decisions in event participation are 1) Facilities and accommodation needs, 2) Affordable costs, 3) Entertainment and Recreation, 4) Professional services, 5) supporting infrastructure and accessibility, 6) according to business needs and destination image, 7) local government support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Accessibility is an absolute factor that connects the delegation's origin area with the destination area. It has also been widely reviewed in a number of regulations in Indonesia, that accessibility is an important factor in supporting the movement</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of people from their area of origin to a destination, thus the hypothesis formulated is: H1: Accessibility affects the buyer’s decision to participate in the event</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Event Organizer as a Factor for Buyer Decision</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Events may have a subjective definition depending on context and needs. Tourism events have grown spectacularly in just a few decades and have become a recognized potential activity in the tourism field (Getz and Page, 2016). In another study, it was also stated that the performance of the event organizer will greatly affect the overall performance of the event (Fiona Hu Ke-wei et al., 2019) even the satisfaction of the attendees (Kakyom Kim and Tucker, 2016). Based on these studies, the proposed hypothesis regarding the effect of event organizers on buyer participation decisions in a business event is as follows: H2: Organizer affect the buyer’s decision to participate in the event</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Accomodation as a Factor for Buyer Decision</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Likewise in organizing an event that is popularly known as the MICE business, accommodation is one of the important considerations for delegates before deciding to participate in an event. Research conducted by Alananzeh et al. (2018) stated that the decision to participate in an event is influenced by multifactorial and accommodation which is claimed to be one of the strong influencing attributes. The availability of accommodation at a destination is part of the propensity to travel for most tourists, where they prepare everything before leaving for a business and stay comfortly when they were arrived, a place that provide warranty inside for security, hospitality factor, a supportive atmosphere and environment, competitive prices, quality service, accessibility, tourist attraction, and convenience of local transportation are</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">all factors that influenced the delegation decision (Buathong and Lai, 2017, Santiago Rodriguez Giron et al., 2019, Marketa Kubickova and Lee, 2018, Saqib, 2019).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The same thing also stated by (Shin-yong Jung et al., 2018, Nadkarni and Wai, 2007, Stela Cristina Hott Correa, 2020) that accommodation is part of an important consideration for travelers when they want to travel to a destination whether it is for both leisure or business purposes. Based on this, the hypothesis that can be formulated is as follows</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">H3: Accomodation the buyer’s decision to participate in the event</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Venue as a Factor for Buyer Decision</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There are many factors that may affect the feasibility of a MICE destination as well as factors that attract delegates when participating in a MICE event (M.Tale-bpour et al., 2017) The venue greatly influences the decisions of the delegates, especially regarding the perception of the image of the destination that is the place of activity (Joshua N Weru and Njoroghe, 2021). A number of studies mentioned that venues with special criteria such as venues that care and support environmental sustainability are a special consideration for delegates (Shinyong Jung et al., 2018). Based on some of these opinions, the proposed hypothesis is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">H4: Venue Affects the buyer’s decision to participate in the event</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Perceived Price as a Factor for Buyer Decision</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The definition of price here is the perceived price or the perception of the overall cost that must be incurred when traveling to a destination. Prices at destinations are an important consideration for buyers when attending business events, this is as mentioned by Choongbeom Choi et al. (2019) Price is said to have a major psychological impact on consumers in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">their decision to choose accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">things including the population and in a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Price is also a consideration in choosing the airline to be used to the destination (Heeshup Han et al., 2021) and perceptions of price become an overall consideration in making general travel decisions (Alain Decrop and Cozak, 2014). Thus, the perception of this price becomes an important factor related to the delegation's decision to attend an event. Based on these arguments, the proposed hypothesis is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">H5: Price affects the buyer’s decision to participate in the event</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/86975-1.png" alt="" style="width:192pt;height:159pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>METHODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This research conducted quantitatively, with data collection techniques with non-probability sampling using purposive sampling method. This method is done by taking samples that are tailored to the objectives of the study and it is hoped that the results are in accordance with the research targets. The sample in this case is 100 buyers at the JITM 2019 event in Yogyakarta and each respondent represents their respective company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The total existing buyers are 130 buyers but this research only took 100 buyers (covered 70 percent from total attendees). According to an article from Berndt (2020) who criticizes the sampling method, it is stated that in determining the sample the researcher must consider many</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">small population it is very possible to do that all members of the population are samples and since the sample was taken purposively, sample bias can be suppressed. minimal. Purposive sampling is used as a control from the researcher because in selecting the sample certain judgments are prioritized, in this case the buyers are the chosen people (not everyone can become a buyer), for example, they must have a medium-high-scale company, have experience in bringing tourists, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The analytical method used is statistical analysis with the classical assumption test technique with the help of SPSS 21 software. The research instrument used was a questionnaire with a number of closed questions. Assessment in order to measure perceptual responsiveness using the Likert Model with the criteria of asses-ment: Very Good grade with 5, Good grade with 4, Neutral grade with 3, Not Good grade with 2, and Bad grade with 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were 5 variables tested in this study that consist of accessibility accessibility, event organizer, accommodation, venue, and perceived of prices. The research design and operational variables can be described below:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accesibility (X1) consists of three indicators i.e: It is easy to get transportation to the destination, transportation cost, and availability of various moda.</span></p></li>
<li>

<li>
<p><span class="font4">6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decision to Participate (Y) which consists of three indicators i.e: Seeking new experience, Business opportunities, Nostalgic and other leisure motivation.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Description of Event and Profile of Respondent JITM (Jogja International Travel Mart) is an annual event for the local government of D.I Yogyakarta related to the travel market that brings together business actors and has been held for the last 10 years. This event involves a number of local sellers and buyers from within and outside the country. In 2019 there were 35 sellers and 130 buyers. In this study, samples taken from the side of 100 buyers only as respondents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The results showed that the respondents consisted of 65 foreign buyers and 35 domestic buyers (See Table.2). Foreign buyers came from Malaysia recorded 16 percent from total participants, Ukraine recorded 2 percent from total, India recorded 6 percent from total, France recorded 14 percent from total, Philiphine recorded 3 percent from total, Singapore recorded 8% from total, Italy 4 percent from total, Uni Emirates Arab recorded 2 percent from total, and Germany recorded 10% from total. Malaysia and France are the most respondents who are also the most dominant buyers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to foreign buyers, this activity was also attended by domestic buyers came from DKI Jakarta recorded 2 percent from total, East Java recorded 5 percent from total, West Java recorded 4 percent from total, Central Java recorded 12 from total, South Sumatera recorded 2 percent from total, and Bali recorded 10 percent from total. On the domestic side, the dominant buyers are coming from Central Java</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sellers are business actors who have close links with tourism, especially parties who have often participated in JITM activities, those involved as respondents in this study include hotel which recorded 45 percent from total, travel agent recorded 37 percent, event organizer recorded 10 percent, ticket services recorded 6 percent, and airlines recorded 2 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Knowing the background of consumer decisions is very important to study in more detail the psychological behavior of consumers (Lawsona, Gleim, &amp;&nbsp;Hartlinec, 2021; Mormann, Griffiths, &amp;&nbsp;Janiszewski, 2020). In this case, a number of organizing business events, especially in the tourism sector, have been widely studied but have not found a definite decision on what variables will most influence the delegation's decision. For the case of organizing a tourism business event in Yogyakarta (JITM) prior to testing based on the questionnaire it was found that there was a common perception of delegates in a business event, the majority of delegates really had a goal to develop business, apart from meeting colleagues and enjoying holidays (see table 1). This motivation will later have a number of links with the factors that will be tested in this study, namely: accessibility, event organizer, accommodation, venue, and prices.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Validity shows the degree to which the question items or instruments represent the concept being measured (Ghozali, 2017). The validity test can be seen by the total value of Pearson's Bivariate Correlation. The test used two tails test with the number of respondent data (n) = 100 respondents, with a significance level of 0.05. The results of the validity test show that the sig value &lt;0.05. Thus, it can be concluded that the questions are valid on all 6 variables and can be used as a research instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reliability test shows the accuracy, suitability and consistency of the questionnaire in measuring variables. A questionnaire is declared reliable if a person's answer to a question is consistent or stable over time. Reliability testing is carried out only on construct indicators that have passed validity and are declared valid. This test was performed using the Cronbach Alpha statistical test. The results of this reliability test show that all variables have an Alpha coefficient&gt; 0.60 and it can be concluded that all the items of the research variable are reliable and can be used as a research instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on normality test which is used to assess whether the observations are normally distributed or not. The test used is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov method. The results of the normality test showed that the asymp.sig value was 0.863&gt; 0.05, so it was concluded that the data were normally distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on multicollinearity test that aims to determine whether there is a correlation between the independent variables in the regression model. The multicollinearity test can only be performed if there is more than one independent variable in the regression model. The most common way used to detect the presence or absence of multicollinearity problems in the regression model is to look at the tolerance value and VIF (Variance Inflation Factor). The recommended value to indicate the absence of multicollinearity problems is that the Tolerance value must be&gt; 0.10 and the VIF value &lt;10.Based on the test results in this study, it is found that the tolerance value is&gt; 0.1 and VIF &lt;10, so the conclusion is that the model proposed in the study is not multicollinearity occurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The important assumption of a classical linear regression model is that the disturbance that occurs in the regression is ho-moscedasticity, that is, all the disturbances have the same variants. Based on the test results of heteroscedasticity test, it is found that the sig. &gt;&nbsp;0.05. Based on this value, it can be concluded that there is no heterosce-dasticity in the regression model, so the regression model is suitable to be used to predict the dependent variable, based on the input of the independent variable.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>The Role of Accesibility Factor</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Based on Table 3. Accesibilty (X1) which the t-count value is 3,612, the regression coefficient is 0.251 with probability (p) = 0.001. This value is smaller than the probability value (p) ≤ 0.05, so it can be concluded that the accessibility variable significantly affects the decision to participate in the event. In other words, the better the variable accessibility to a destination will automatically be able to increase the decision to participate to the events. Accessibility factors include the ease of getting a mode of transportation to the destination, transportation costs, and the diversity of transportation modes that can be used.</span></p>

This value is smaller than the probability value with (p) ≤ 0.05, so it can be concluded that the organizer variable is significant in the decision to participate in the event. The explanation was that the better the event organizer in performance and reputation would automatically increase the decision to participate from the delegates. </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font3">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font4">Accomodation (X3) as showing at Table 3. in the partial regression test for this variable, the t-count value is 3,650, the regression coefficient is 0.263 with probability (p) = 0.001. This value is smaller than the probability value (p) ≤ 0.05 so that the conclusion is that the accomodation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">variable significantly affects the decision to participate in the event. Accommodation factors include the ease of finding accommodation, hotel prices, variety and type of hotel. The explanation was that the ease of obtaining accommodation, competitive prices, and varied accommodation types simultaneously would be able to increase buyers' interest in participating in the event.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>The Role of Venue Factor</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Venue (X4) as showing at Table 3 the result of the partial regression test produces a t-value of 3.147 with a regression coefficient of 0.251 and probability (p) = 0.003. This value is lower than the probability value (p) ≤ 0.05, so it can be said that the venue variable has a significant effect on the buyer’s decision to participate to the event. Strategic venue location, adequate venue facilities, capacity and comfort of a venue able to increase the interest of buyers to participate to an event in the destination. The better the condition of a venue, the greater the interest of participants in joining the event.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>The Role of Prices Factor</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Prices (X5) as showing at Table 3. The t-count value was obtained for 2.780 regression coefficient 0.230 with probability (p) = 0.007. Based on the results of data processing where the probability value (p) ≤ 0.05, it can be concluded that the price variable has a significant effect on the buyer’s decision to participate to the events. This proves that Yogyakarta, with its excess of low prices, is able to increase buyer decision to Participate to the event. The price component refers to the overall costs that will be incurred, the cost of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">accommodation and transportation, as well as the cost of eating, drinking, and shopping for souvenirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on all the test results, the formula for the factors that affecting the buyer’s decision at the JITM business event will be obtained as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Y= -0.612 + 0.251 X1 + 0.166X2 + 0.263X3 + 0.251X4 + 0.230X5 + e</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Constant value -0.612: This means that if none of the variables of Accessibility, Organizer, Accommodation, Venue and Price affect, then the decision to participate in the event is -0.612.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the Table 3. it can be seen that the size of the Adjusted R Square from the factors of Accessibility, Event Organizer, Accommodation, Venue and Prices in explaining or predicting the decision to participate in the event is 0.702 or 70.2 percent. This means that the independent variables provide sufficient information needed to predict the variation in the dependent variable, and the rest (100 percent -70.2 percent = 29.8 percent) is explained or predicted by other factors outside of the five factors and other models outside that.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Table 5 shows that among the factors that influence the decision of buyers to participate is accommodation. In this research, a number of interviews were also conducted with a number of buyers, and they talked about the reasons why hotels are very important in influencing the decision to participate in the event. In general, buyers have the following reasons first, Yogyakarta is a small city with a very dense hotel population, various hotels are available with various facilities that give consumers the flexibility to choose what they want and provide a comfortable atmosphere to rest. In Yogyakarta there are approximately 1200 hotels with 60 star hotels and the rest are non-star hotels including boutique hotels with unique lodging concepts. Second, hotels are considered more secure in terms of health in terms of places and meals, as well as security. Third, the proximity of the hotel to the venue or even the location of the venue and a number of other leisure facilities is a distinct advantage for the delegation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although hotel ranks as the most dominant variable that influences the decision of the delegation (buyer), it does not</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">consideration of these five factors. Of course, it is very important to carry out this kind of research gradually at every strategic event that plays an important role in a business field, so that it can provide benefits in decision making or business development policies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The limitation of this research is that there has never been research like this in previous events, this is part of a preliminary study in Indonesia. This event is very exclusive and is not open to ordinary consumers, only business to business. However, it has an important role in supporting the development of the tourism sector in the region. Suggestions that can be given are to be more intensive in research on business events like this because they have economic importance for the region, depending on the scale of the event, the larger the scale of the event, the greater the benefits that can be obtained.</span></p>
