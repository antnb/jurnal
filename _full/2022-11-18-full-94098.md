<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">As a tool for legal spelling and phonetic transcription of Chinese, the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme is an indispensable tool for international Chinese teaching. International Chinese teachers should systematically understand it in theory, pay attention to some details in the teaching of Chinese Phonetic Alphabet, improve the teaching effect of Chinese Phonetic Alphabet, and avoid detours. Alphabet, and avoid detours. The Chinese alphabet, has a very strong effectiveness to avoid inappropriate sounds. Between the spelling and the sound it convinces listeners to really believe in learning Chinese</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">At present, more and more foreigners are beginning to learn Chinese as a second foreign language. According to relevant statistics, &quot;by the end of 2021, more than 180 countries and regions have carried out Chinese education, and 76 countries have incorporated Chinese into their national education systems. More than 25 million foreigners are learning Chinese, and nearly 200 million people have learned and used Chinese in total.&quot;(Ministry of Education,2022) The first thing that Chinese learners come into contact with is Pinyin. As the legal spelling and phonetic notation tool of Chinese, the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme is the &quot;cornerstone of international Chinese teaching&quot; (Zhao,2013) and the standard and authority that should be followed when learning Pinyin. &quot;The application of the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme in the teaching of Chinese as a foreign language has become an irresistible world trend.&quot;( Lü,1983)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Article 18 of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the National Common Language stipulates that &quot;The Chinese Pinyin System Scheme is used as a tool for spelling and</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">phonetic transcription of the national common language and characters. The Chinese Pinyin System Scheme is a unified standard for the spelling of Chinese names, place names and the Roman alphabet of Chinese documents, and is used in areas where Chinese characters are inconvenient or cannot be used.&quot;(Law of the People's Republic of China on Standard Chinese Language,2022).The Chinese Pinyin System Scheme adopts the internationally popular Latin alphabet, so it is easy for foreign learners to master and facilitate international cultural exchanges. It is an effective tool for teaching and learning Chinese Putonghua.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Method</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">This study mainly uses interviews method. The main interview objects are Indonesian local Chinese teachers. They are from Universitas Hasanuddin, Universitas Negeri Makassar, Politeknik Negeri Bali, and Universitas Udayana. The Chinese pinyin issues that need to be noticed by Chinese learners are based on the 8-year international Chinese teaching practice observation of researchers.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion</span><br><br><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Uses of the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme in International Chinese Teaching</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">As an effective tool, The Chinese Pinyin System Scheme has many uses in international Chinese teaching:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “ magic weapon” for international Chinese teachers.</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">The Chinese Pinyin System Scheme is a programmatic document in the teaching of Chinese Phonetic Alphabet. International Chinese teachers should be familiar with its content, know its nature, and know its reason. They should accurately and systematically master the Chinese phonetic system, practice basic skills, and pronounce accurate sounds. Only in this way can they correct pronunciation and correct pronunciation in Chinese teaching.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “crutch” for foreign students to learn Chinese.</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">The Chinese Pinyin System Scheme is written in the international common Latin alphabet, which makes foreign students not feel strange when they see them at first sight. To some extent, it eliminates their fear of &quot;the most difficult language in the world&quot; and makes them quickly enter the learning state. It can be said that Pinyin learning is a crutch for foreign students to learn Chinese. Making good use of this crutch in the early stage is conducive to the learning of Chinese characters and grammar later.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An effective Pinyin typing tool.</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">After learning the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme, foreign students can use the &quot;Pinyin Input Method&quot; or &quot;Sougou Pinyin Input Method&quot; to complete the learning and working tasks such as typing, sending WeChat messages, and sending emails, so as to achieve the goal of real communication with Chinese people. Students only need to download the &quot;Sougou Pinyin Input Method&quot; app on the computer to achieve pinyin input. For example, five stroke input and stroke input, pinyin input makes the learning journey of foreign Chinese learners more convenient.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>3.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important speech recognition tool.</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Students who have learned Pinyin well generally have good pronunciation. When they issue a string of notes, modern speech recognition systems can correctly recognize their Chinese pronunciation, which enhances their confidence and reduces the trouble of typing.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>3.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mastering Chinese Pinyin by using the phonetic order to search the dictionary.</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">At present, the common ways to look up dictionaries are radical retrieval and pinyin retrieval. The former is to search for Chinese characters according to the number of the first stroke, while the latter is to search for Chinese characters through the sequence of sounds. Having mastered the Chinese Pinyin, foreign students can use the phonetic order to search Chinese characters smoothly and quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a word, the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme has many uses in international Chinese teaching. However, in the practice of international Chinese teaching, &quot;The Chinese Pinyin System Scheme has not attracted enough attention in the minds of teachers. Many teachers only know what the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme is, but do not know why it is. During the teaching process, they cannot give correct explanations to the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme. There is no way to correct the students' pronunciation, explain it inaccurately, and lack of oral and ear skills. Therefore, in Chinese teaching and learning, there is still considerable space to discover of the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme&quot;.(Zhao,2013)</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Details Needing Attention in Phonetic Teaching</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">In the practice of teaching Chinese as a foreign language, many Chinese teachers have encountered problems in using the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme. Some scholars believe that this is the &quot;defect&quot; (Ding,2007)or &quot;problem&quot; (Li,2017)(Ye,1997)of the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme. In fact, most of these problems are caused by the lack of comprehensive understanding of the Chinese phonetic system by international Chinese teachers. Many teachers do not understand the subtle differences between the spelling form and the actual pronunciation, resulting in problems of one kind or another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These detailed problems include several -i problems in letter spelling, -u and -</span><span class="font4">U </span><span class="font8">problems, -ong and - iong problems, - in and - ing problems, abbreviation problem of- iou, - uen, - uei) , -o and -uo problems. This paper attempts to analyze these problems and put forward suggestions, hoping to help the International Chinese Pinyin teaching.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay attention to the three - i</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">As a teacher of Chinese as a foreign language, when teaching Pinyin, we must pay attention to the three “-i” in Pinyin. Although they are all written as -i, their pronunciation is not all pronounced as [i]. For example:</span></p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">Position of -i</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">Real Pronunciation</span></p></td><td colspan="3" style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">Examples</span></p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">Behind the initial j-,q-,and x-</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">Be read as [i]</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">ji[ tɕi]</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">qi[tɕ’i ]</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">xi[ ɕi]</span></p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">Behind the initial z-,c-,and s-</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">Be read as[ɿ]</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">zi[tsɿ]</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">ci[ts’ɿ]</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">si[sɿ]</span></p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">Behind the initial zh-,ch-,and sh</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">Be read asʅ]</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">zhi[tʂʅ]</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">chi[tʂ’ʅ]</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font8">shi[ʂʅ]</span></p></td></tr>
</table>
<p><span class="font8">From the above table, we can easily see that the pronunciation of - i is different after different initials. Therefore, when teaching Chinese Pinyin, we must emphasize it repeatedly, and don't be confused by the writing form of Pinyin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here are some examples of common words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Words that can be read as [i] such as:</span><span class="font4">鸡蛋</span><span class="font8">( jī dàn)</span><span class="font4">，生气</span><span class="font8">( shēnɡ qì)</span><span class="font4">，西瓜</span><span class="font8">( xī ɡua)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Words that can be read as read [ɿ] such as:</span><span class="font4">汉字</span><span class="font8">( hàn zì)</span><span class="font4">，一次</span><span class="font8">( yí cì)</span><span class="font4">，死亡</span><span class="font8">( sǐ wánɡ)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Words that can be read as read[ʅ]such as:</span><span class="font4">知道</span><span class="font8">( zhī dào)</span><span class="font4">，吃饭</span><span class="font8">( chī fàn)</span><span class="font4">，老师</span><span class="font8">( lǎo shī)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During teaching and learning, teachers and students must pay attention to distinguish the - i in the following words, and must not mispronounce it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark26"></a>司机( sī jī)，十四( shí sì)，四十( sì shí)，祭祀( jì sì)，其实( qí shí)，喜事( xǐ shì)， 刺激( cì jī)，四肢( sì zhī)，启齿( qǐ chǐ)，知悉( zhī xī) </span><span class="font8">and so on.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">In the early stage of Pinyin teaching, omitting the -i behind z, c, s and zh, ch, sh can avoid students mixing with ji, qi, xi, which is easier to accept.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay attention to -u and -</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ü</span></h4></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">-u and -</span><span class="font4">ü </span><span class="font8">are both round lip high vowels, one of which is the front high vowel, the other is the rear high vowel. They have different scope of application and cannot be misused. -u and -</span><span class="font4">ü </span><span class="font8">can be combined with n and l to form nu, lu, nü, lü, but j, q, x can only be combined with -</span><span class="font4">ü</span><span class="font8">, not with u.</span></p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"></td><td style="vertical-align:middle;">

<p><span class="font8">lu</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;"></td><td style="vertical-align:top;"></td><td style="vertical-align:top;"></td></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">
<p><span class="font8">ü</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">

<p><span class="font8">qü</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Be written as “qu”</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">
<p><span class="font8">xü</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Be written as “xu”</span></p></td></tr>
</table></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">It is easy to be confused here, it is easy to be confused. When ü is spelled with j, q and x, it is written as ju, qu, and xu, in other words, the two points above u are omitted. This is where foreigners are prone to make mistakes when learning Chinese Pinyin. International Chinese teachers must pay attention in teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here are some examples of common words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The words that can be read as -u: </span><span class="font3">努力( nǔ lì)，陆地( lù dì) </span><span class="font8">and so on.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The words that can be read as -ü: </span><span class="font3">女孩( nǚ hái)，绿色( lǜ sè)，举行( jǔ xínɡ)，来去( lái qù)，需要( xū yào) </span><span class="font8">and so on.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The consonants and vowels in Chinese have a strong regularity.Mastering the rules of consonants and vowels can prevent learners from making mistakes in pinyin and spelling. For example, j, q, x can be spelled with the vowels of Qichihu (Finals begin with i) and Cuokouhu (Finals begin with -ü ), but cannot be spelled with the vowels of Kaikou (Finals do not begin with -i, -u -ü) and Hekouhu (Finals begin with -u ).(Zhao,2013) There is no syllable &quot;qu&quot; in Chinese, &quot;qu&quot; cannot be pronounced as [tɕ’u]. Another example is that the retroflex sounds zh, ch, sh, r cannot be matched with the vowels of Qiqihu(Finals begin with -i ) and Cuokouhu(Finals begin with -ü ), and the “</span><span class="font3">师(shī)</span><span class="font8">”in the word of&quot;</span><span class="font3">老师( lǎo shī)</span><span class="font8">&quot; cannot be pronounced [ʂi].</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some scholars suggest that in the early stage of pinyin teaching, ju, qu and xu should be written as jü, qü and xü first. After a period of practice, when students get used to this pronunciation, they should be rewritten as ju, qu and xu.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>3.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay attention to -ong and -iong</span></h4></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">-ong and -iong are both nasal finals, their actual pronunciations are ong[uŋ] and [yŋ]. The Chinese Pinyin Scheme uses &quot;ong, iong&quot; to denote [uŋ] and [yŋ] without &quot;ung, üng&quot; to make the character clear and avoid mixing of handwritten u and ü.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">In practical teaching, Chinese learners often mispronounce ong and iong as [[oŋ] and [iŋ], for example, they mispronounce the &quot;</span><span class="font4">红</span><span class="font8">( h</span><span class="font4">ó</span><span class="font8">ng)&quot; as [xoŋ] and mispronounce the &quot;</span><span class="font4">熊</span><span class="font8">&quot; as [ ɕoŋ].</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here are some examples of other words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Words with -ong are such as: </span><span class="font3">东边( dōnɡ biān)、通过( tōnɡ ɡuò)、农民( nónɡ mín)、 龙( lónɡ)、工人( ɡōnɡ rén)、空调( kōnɡ tiáo)、红色( hónɡ sè)、中国( zhōnɡ ɡuó)、充满 ( chōnɡ mǎn)、容貌( rónɡ mào)、匆忙( cōnɡ mánɡ)、松鼠( sōnɡ shǔ) </span><span class="font8">and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Words with -iong are such as:</span><span class="font3">窘迫( jiǒnɡ pò)、穷困( qiónɡ kùn)、兄弟( xiōnɡ dì)、拥抱 ( yōnɡ bào) </span><span class="font8">and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the beginning of Pinyin teaching, ong can also be rewritten as ung and iong as üng. After students master the actual pronunciation, they can rewrite to -ong and -iong again.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>3.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay attention to -in and -ing</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;The actual pronunciation of -in and -ing is [iən] [iən], actually there's a weak transition [ə] in the middle, so it's very short and vague when you spell it. It is difficult to pronounce in and ing without this sound. in fact, it is very difficult to say in and ing alphabetically. This must be told to foreign students.&quot;(Huang &amp;&nbsp;Liao,2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here are some examples of other words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Words with -in are such as:</span><span class="font3">宾馆( bīn ɡuǎn)，拼音( pīn yīn)，敏感( mǐn ɡǎn)，您( ní n)，森林( sēn lín)，一斤( yì jīn)，亲爱( qīn ài)，新书( xīn shū)，因为( yīn wéi) </span><span class="font8">and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Words with -ing are such as:</span><span class="font3">冰箱( bīnɡ xiānɡ)，平静( pínɡ jìnɡ)，名字( mínɡ zì)，叮嘱</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">( dīnɡ zhǔ)，听到( tīnɡ dào)，宁静( nínɡ jìnɡ)，零( línɡ)，北京( Běi jīnɡ)，请进( qǐnɡ jì n)，星星( xīnɡ xinɡ)，应该( yīnɡ ɡāi) </span><span class="font8">and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When designing the teaching of -in and -ing, teachers need to inform students that the middle “e” should be read quickly, lightly and briefly, and do not stay for too long.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>3.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay attention to the abbreviation of -iou, -uen, and -uei</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">According to the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme, -iou, -uei, and -uen should be abbreviated as -iu, -ui, and -un when they are in front of the initials, such as niu, ɡui, lun, and the vowels which been abbreviated will cause certain cognitive difficulties for beginners, who will get used to reading that pronunciation directly mispronounce as [iu],[ui], and [un].</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here are some examples of other words.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">In the primary stage of Chinese pinyin teaching, students must be taught in accordance with their aptitude according to the characteristics of their mother tongue. International Chinese teachers can complete the pinyin according to the teaching needs, for example, the spelling of &quot;xiu&quot; is written as xi(o)u, &quot;gui&quot; is written as gu(e)i; &quot;gun&quot; is written as gu(e)n. This variant serves as a phonetic cue that the bracketed vowel should be omitted in formal writing.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>3.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay attention to -o and -uo</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">In the final table of the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme, there are two pronunciations -o and -uo, which should be paid attention to in teaching Chinese Pinyin as a foreign language.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">-o is pronounced as [o] only when it is used alone, such as &quot;o&quot;, which means &quot;already know&quot;. When the -o is spelt with other initials, the pronunciation changes to -uo, such as bo [puo], po [p 'uo], mo [muo], fo [fuo], etc. In the actual teaching of Pinyin, we can also make a temporary change and add the intermediate voice in the middle, so that the teaching effect may be better.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">To sum up, Chinese phonetic teaching is not achieved overnight, need to work hard in the theory and practice.the key in the Chinese phonetic teaching is to allow students to set up a kind of correct pinyin concept: in the Chinese Pinyin System Scheme , there is not a one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, and you can't exactly equate alphabetic pinyin with actual pronunciation &quot;.(Wang,2005)Under the guidance of this concept, teachers should step by step guide students to pronounce according to the actual pronunciation, rather than simply looking at the appearance of letters to spell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In addition, teachers should not be too strict with the pronunciation of foreign students at the beginning stage, because there are many Chinese people who cannot pronounce well with zh, ch, sh, r and j, q, x , and this does not affect the communication between them. Therefore, in the initial phonetic teaching, teachers should tolerate some phonetic errors of foreign students, as long as it does not affect communication, appropriate mistakes are allowed and accepted.</span></p>
