<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Information security is a vital aspect that must be considered in use of information technology devices by active users. PT. X runs a business that applies information technology related to distribution aspects through company resource planning. Information technology formed assets IT infrastructure, information systems, operating procedures, and network infrastructure. This asset has a potential threat that causes disruption resulting losses. This problem arises to cope through the response to the risk strategy. NIST SP 800-30 method has a flexible risk perspective for the organization and federation standards of American security. Research is divided into risk measurement as a risk, risk mitigation as risk planning, and risk evaluation embodied risk reports. Results of the research show the value of risk through the calculation of the likelihood and impact matrix of the highest threat is at a low level is 14, medium at 12, and high of 4 are categorized good enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Keywords</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">: Risk Strategy, Information Security, NIST SP 800-30, Risk</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">what standards will be used or chosen for companies in conducting information security risk management audits so based on view aspects according to the needs of investigators [5]. Evaluation in the selection of strategies for managing information security, controls must have high reliability, in order to improve and minimize the risk of loss that may arise [1] - [6].</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">PT. X embodies information technology through IT infrastructure in carrying out company management operations. Management activities carried out by entering, processing, managing, and reporting supported by the IT system builders. Information part of the data that is formed is an important part in facing business competition. Referring to achieving the company's vision and mission so that operations do not hinder from disruption, so the information shall be guaranteed security against the risk of loss. PT. X has not yet implemented a risk strategy for its system builders, therefore it is necessary to carry out a risk strategy for information security. The risk strategy is expected to show the quantity of repair costs for development planning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Analysis of risk strategies referring to risk management for research by Monika Evelin Johan, et al. determined by the NIST SP 800-30 method. The vulnerability process using the newly frozen NIST SP 800-26 and recommendations provided only the status of control measures [7] - [8]. Research by Dian Ayu Permatasari, et al, which emphasizes the initial process in threatening risks. The analysis emphasizes the risk of the NIST SP 800-30 only at the risk screening stage. Vulnerability identification is still using NIST SP 800-26 which has just been frozen and the recommendation is not at the risk mitigation stage [9]- [8]. The achievement of this research with an emphasis on the NIST SP 800-30 method through the latest published support for vulnerability testing using NIST SP 800-53A Revision 4 and following the standard process to the risk mitigation stage to see the amount of risk costs at PT. X.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The method that can be used to carry out a risk strategy in information management is NIST SP 800-30. The choice of the NIST SP 800-30 method is due to its shortcomings as a risk management stream [10]. A framework that can determine information control risks complemented by information management recommendations. Aspect guarantees it in terms of security, confidentiality, integrity, data and data used for development, improvement, and evaluation evaluation [11].</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Research with the NIST SP 800-30 method to see the level of risk of information security on the implementation of IS or IT at PT. X, which is expected to be a development life cycle carried out by the IT Division at PT. X. The NIST SP 800-30 method is equipped with a strategic control process in terms of financing processing that adapts to organizational conditions while adhering to guidelines. This research as the aim to determine the risk level of vulnerability information by using NIST SP 800-30, so as to develop risk control strategy steps with control recommendations equipped with financing to be used as a reference for improving information security at PT. X [3] - [12].</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methodology Flow</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The methodology flows through a defined stage process. The process flow is presented in Figure 1.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/71122-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:210pt;height:221pt;">
<p><span class="font1">Figure 1. Methodology Flow</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 1 shows the research flow in the analysis of information security risk strategies at PT. X. The first stages of flow is the Planning Phase, through the process of formulating the problem at PT. X. This stage is to formulate problems in the field and the process of studying literature by looking for references, theoretical sources, supporting data in strengthening research studies. The second stage is data collection by conducting interview observation of documentation studies at PT. X. [9]. The second stage is to visit and find out about current IT risk issues. The third stage is analyzing and the fourth stage is the completion phase which is part of the NIST SP 800-30 method [9] - [11]. The NIST SP 800-30 stage is divided into three parts, including the assessment stage to assess risk, the risk mitigation stage as control, The risk evaluation stage is in preparing the final risk report, each of which has a detailed process.[10].</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first part of the risk assessment is identifying risks with eight processes including the first process of characterizing the system to find out the components that make up the system including hardware and software, the second process of identifying threats in detecting opportunities for threats that occur, the third process of identifying vulnerabilities through an assessment of the authorized party by the controller and IT supervisors, the fourth process of control analysis in determining the threat of vulnerability, the fifth process of determining likelihood as ensuring the probability of the likelihood that is vulnerable to threatening, the sixth process carries out an impact analysis to determine the resulting impact on the threat of vulnerability, the seventh process of determining risk as ensuring the level of risk to the vulnerability threat, and the last process carries out control recommendations which specified in the NIST SP 800-53 standard [10].</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second part is risk mitigation as the implementation of appropriate repair control. There are six processes in this part of the process, including prioritizing action as a risk level action rating for action, providing recommendations for control options referring to NIST SP 80030, conducting cost-benefit analysis in determining control costs against the level of risk, selecting controls to select the appropriate control conditions, and the final process of assigning responsibility in dividing the parties responsible for implementing risk mitigation [10]. The last part of the risk evaluation is the final process of the completion stage, as the implementation of a risk strategy for the implementation of risk control. This implementation is carried out in a determined period by considering the decision on the readiness for implementation that involves senior management [10]. The final document defines the findings as a continuous development life cycle [10].</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">NIST 800-30 risk theory, the implementation of the process risk management through the NIST SP 800-30 guideline, namely risk assessment by taking eight stages that must be passed, risk mitigation with 6 stages must be passed and risk evaluation (risk evaluation) by forming the composition of this final report [10]. The allotment of supporting guidelines is in line with NIST SP 800-30, namely NIST SP 800-26 to determine vulnerability identification [10]. Since 2015, NIST SP 800-26 replaced to NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 4 as the standard guide to assess the security and privacy controls in assessing the vulnerability identification.[14]. This refers to the control recommendations updated also with NIST 800-53 Revision 4 for relevant adjustments to NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 4 related to security and privacy controls as a form of information security assessment in an organization [14]. The model form guides this document following a harmonious approach to the complement of the ISO/IEC 30001 and 27005 standards [15] - [16].</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The discussion of the results taken from the methodological steps carried out in the company organization PT. X. The results are shown from the NIST SP 800-30 method process [10]. elements related to the use of IT crucially in the form of hardware specifications to determine vital assets, network device architecture in terms of the existence of a data center that forms a network topology equipped with internet allocation details, the discovery of a software model applied to the organization, namely the zeta which is a distribution group business operation by PT. X part of enterprise resource planning which describes business processes, system architecture, information system forming specifications, has a physical security role in terms of tightening policy procedures, CCTV, fingerprint privileges. This finding serves as a sign for threats that can be defined as the identification of IT assets and the IT boundaries that are applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second stage it’s the identification of threats, namely the assessment includes events that have occurred as a potential assessment of inherent direct vulnerability and classification of potential threats consisting of 3 aspects of human, environmental and IT infrastructure which refers to the considerations of the NIST SP 800-30 guidelines [10].</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The third stage is the analysis of the self-assessment to determine the threats that produce risks. The acquisition of risk arises through the results of a questionnaire assessment of federal and organizational information security and privacy control guides in Sp nist. 800-53A Rev. 4 through the absence of potential controls in assessing vulnerability [15].

<p><span class="font1">Information on security risk strategies using the NIST SP 800-30 method in this study has been implemented quite well. The value process determines the vital assets that are threatened in the use of IT at PT. X. Acquisition of information technology assets that affect aspects of company information security. PT. X there are four assets including IT infrastructure, Zeta information systems, PC users, network infrastructure. The findings of this study are based on four identified assets, there are 30 threats which include 19, medium 17, and high 4 identified risk levels. The results of the dominant risk level on the low scale state that the risk value is quite good, seen from low level 14 high, but almost close to medium level 12, and far from high level 4. control recommendations given to risky threats are the implementation of improvement control through recapitulation. the results of 30 risk mitigation control, risk limitation 16, risk avoidance 13, and risk transfer 1 are categorized as good because they dominate the application of risk limitation from other controls. to defend from distraction. Mitigation controls to reduce the threat of risk by complementing the availability of appropriate security controls to avoid disruption or damage through control recommendations</span></p>
