<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of The Study</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Saussure cited in Chandler (2001:28) defines a sign as the composition of a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“signifier”</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“signified”</span><span class="font3">. Signifier is the form which the sign takes. Signified is the concept it represents both in verbal and visual. In the advertisement verbal signs are about texts used to describe the product itself and the advertiser has to choose the proper words to make a good language because the words in advertisement give explanation or information about the product itself. And visual signs are about the picture or something that we can see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this modern era, advertisement exists everywhere because we can find advertisement everywhere, like at the street, in front of a store, in a magazine, newspaper, and also in social media. The advertisement has a primary purpose to introduce products to the public in order to attract the target audience to buy and use the products. So, to achieve those goals, advertiser has to create interesting advertisement containing verbal signs such as a good language or sentence which takes an important role to give explanation and information about the product itself, and visual signs such as the picture of the product, the logo of the company, and the colour of the advertisement, because picture or visual signs can make people easier to understand the meaning of the advertisement.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusions</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the foregoing analysis and discussion, the following points can be concluded:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The result of data analysis in the first problem shows that the advertiser tends to use conceptual meaning and informational function to convey the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">meaning and deliver information to attract the interest of readers so they feel called to buy their products. The other meaning and function of language like connotative meaning, affective meaning, and expressive function were also used in the advertisements but not as much as conceptual meaning and informational function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And the result of data analysis in the second problem shows that the verbal and visual signs are related to each other, each has an important role in shaping an advertisement in order to be meaningful. Verbal sign as the part that describes what is meant by visual sign and the visual sign illustrates what is meant by the verbal sign. So, what is shown in the visual sign is inappropriate with what is written in the verbal sign and vice versa.</span></p>
