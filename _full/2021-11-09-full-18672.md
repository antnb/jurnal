<p><span class="font6">In the small gold mining regions of Indonesia, the tailings or waste water containing mercury commonly may be released into agricultural lands resultimg soil contamination. Phytoremediation is a low-cost and environmental friendly alternative to traditional techniques such as soil heating, soil removal, and soil washing. In this study, a sweet sorghum combined with the inoculation of a rhizobacteria, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens,</span><span class="font6"> was tested in a field experiment with mercury contaminated soil from a small scale gold mining. Plant growth, uptake and accumulation of mercury by the sweet sorghum, and effects of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font6"> inoculation on mercury accumulation were investigated. The average of mercury content in the soil was 3.76 mg/kg. The results showed that the sorghum grew well, and the inoculation of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens </span><span class="font6">promoted the plant growth, but did not increased the mercury concentration in both root and stem parts of the sorghum. The accumulation of mercury was 6.2</span><span class="font4">^</span><span class="font6">/plant for sorghum without </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font6">, and 14.0</span><span class="font4">^</span><span class="font6">/plant for sorghum with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font6">.

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">Mercury is a global environmental pollutant presented in soil, water, atmosphere and biota, and one of the “priority hazardous substances” listed by the Agency for Toxic Substances and disease registry (ATSDR) because of its toxicity, mobility, and long residence time in the atmosphere (Wang </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font6">, 2012). Mercury pollution is a serious threat to human health and the environment. Mercury exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of people of all ages. The most serious effect is damage to the central nervous system, especially in fetuses and young children (CPA, 2010).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mercury enters environment through natural process and human activities. Natural</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">processes generally constitute the rock weathering, volcanic activities and geothermal activities (Nriagu </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">., 2003). The average background concentration of mercury in soils is averagely 0.06 mg/kg with a general range from 0.03 to 0.1 mg/kg (Wang </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font6">, 2012). The anthropogenic sources of mercury can be attributed as coal combustion, waste incineration, metal refining and manufacturing (Wang </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font6">, 2012; UNEP, 2013). According to UNEP (2013), it is estimated that the global emissions to air from anthropogenic sources is 1960 tonnes in 2010, responsible for about 30% of annual total emissions of mercury to air. The artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) and coal burning is the largest components of anthropogenic emissions, followed by the production of ferrous and non-ferrous metals,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and cement production. Annual emissions from ASGM are estimated at 727 tonnes, responsible for the largest sector accounting for over 35% of total anthropogenic emissions. Asia is the main source region of mercury emissions to air, and East and Southeast Asia account for about 40% of the global total (UNEP, 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Indonesia is one of the major location for ASGM, where there are 731 ASGM sites throughout the country (Muddarisna </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font6">, 2013). ASGM are causing environmental pollution because of the widespread use of mercury in the gold extraction processes. After the gold-containing ore or silt is thoroughly grinded, mercury is added to the mixture to create a gold amalgam. Subsequent burning of the amalgam concentrates the gold into a pellet but releases elemental mercury into the environment. There is a mercury loss to the environment through discharge of water used for grinding. The discharge of gold amalgamation tailings to agricultural lands also causes soil contamination. The contamination of soil with mercury has led to environmental concerns, as mercury can readily be absorbed by plants and be accumulated in the human body through the food chain. It has been well known that crops grown in mercury contaminated soil have an elevated total mercury content in their tissues (Qian </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font6">2009; Wang </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font6">, 2012). Studies also clearly show that mercury contamination of soils result in an elevated exposure of mercury to local residents and pose a direct threat to the health of these people (Wang </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font6">, 2012). Therefore, there is a great need to develop suitable methods for remediation of mercury contaminated soils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past decade, phytoremediation, the use of green plants and their associated microbiota for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in situ </span><span class="font6">treatment of contaminated sites has received increasing attention as a cost-effective and ecofriendly technology (Salt </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">. 1998; Ahmadpour </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">. 2012; Oh </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">., 2013). Phytoremediation to date indicates that it is applicable to a wide range of inorganic pollutants such as Cd, Pb, Cu, Ni, Hg, and As,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and organic pollutants such as pesticides and chlorinated solvents (Oh </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">., 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The phytoremediation usually has a low remediation rate, and thus generally a longer period (usually over 3 or 5 years) is needed comparing to other physicochemical methods. To improve the phytoremediation rate, studies have focused on hyper accumulator plants, which is capable of accumulating potentially phytotoxic elements to concentrations much higher than the normal plants growing in the same environment (Salt </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font6"> 1998; Oh </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">., 2013). However, most of these hyperaccumulator plants usually have a low annual biomass production, which tends to limit their remediation ability. Moreover, as they have very high heavy metal concentration, after harvested the plants usually need incineration treatment. In this way, the conventional phytoremediation needs cost year by year, and the owners of the contaminated sites have no income during the remediation period, which has been limited the practical application of phytoremediation (Oh </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">., 2013; 2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In recent years, other economic plants are receiving increasingly attention as they can both remediate contaminated soils, and produce valuable biomass, through which the practical application of phytoremediation can be promoted and the soil resources can be protected (Chintakovid </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font6">, 2008; Oh </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">. 2014).So far, high biomass crops such as Indian mustard (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Brassica juncea</span><span class="font6">), maize (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Zea mays</span><span class="font6">), sunflower (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Helianthus annus</span><span class="font6">), and sweet sorghum (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sorghum bicolor var. saccharatum</span><span class="font6">) have been demonstrated to be able to remediated various heavy metals (Utami </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">., 2013; ). To improve the remediation rate, studies on means for enhancing phytoremdiation have been extensively carried out. The measures for enhanced phytoremediation mainly include application of chelating agents, effective bacteria, and genetic plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Soil from gold mining areas generally has a high proportion of bioavailable mercury because of the release of mercury into the soil as a soluble form. Therefore, phytoremdiation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ISSN ONLINE: 9 772303 337 008</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">should be a suitable choice for these soils or tailings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The objectives of this study are to determine the potential of a sweet sorghum for phytoremediation of mercury contaminated soil in the small scale gold mining area in Indonesia, and the effects of inoculation of a rhizobacteria, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefacian</span><span class="font6">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This study was carried out in the field owned by Mr. Sutaryo where the soil was contaminated by discharge of small-scale gold amalgamation tailings containing mercury. The site is located in Nglenggong, Jendi, Selogiri, Wonogiri, Jawa Tengah, Indonesia (07</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">°</span><span class="font6">47</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">´</span><span class="font6">51</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;</span><span class="font6">S, 110</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">°</span><span class="font6">52</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">´</span><span class="font6">21</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;</span><span class="font6">E), with an elevation of 498 feet.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Soil preparation and fertilization</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">Field experiment was conducted from June to November, 2013. The soil had an initial total mercury content of 3.8 mg/kg. When experiment started, the soil was mixed evenly, and was applied fertilizers of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium with the fertilization rates as shown in form1. The experimental field was divided into nine blocks. Two treatments with three replications were designed. The two treatments were sweet sorghum plantation (TN) and sweet sorghum plantation with bacteria inoculation, respectively.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Sweet sorghum plantation and rhizo-bacteria inoculation</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">Sweet sorghum variety KCS105 was used in this study. The seeds of the KCS105 were germinated at room temperature for 1 week in petri dishes. Then, the sorghum seedlings of similar size and appearance were used to transplant to the experimental field, with a plantation density of 667,00 plant/ha.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A rhizobacterial isolate (I<sub>29</sub> Isolate), </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font6">, which was proved to be able to enhance chromium uptake by maize, were used in this study. As described by</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Utami </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">.(2013), the Chromium uptake enhancing </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font6"> was cultured in liquid LB medium for 24 hours until its cell concentration reached 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml. The inoculation of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens </span><span class="font6">was done when the sorghum seedlings were transplanted by pouring the bacterial cultural solution to the soil. Sweet sorghum was harvested 12 weeks (about three months) after transplantation. The plant height above the ground in each plot was measured once a week. After harvest, shoots and roots were separated, washed, weighted and oven dried at 40°</span><span class="font4">C </span><span class="font6">for 48 hours for determining the dry biomass of the plants and the mercury content.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Oven died plants were cut into small pieces and ground, then, the powdered plant tissues were dissolved in 5ml of dilute acid mixture (60% HClO4; 65% HNO3, 1:1 v/v) in flask. Mercury content in plant and soil were analyzed using a FIMS 100CVAAS from Perkin Elmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Growth of sweet sorghum</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">Plant height within 12 weeks is shown in Fig.1. Plant height both for TN and TNB increased with time, indicating that the sorghum</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">grew well in the mercury contaminated soil. Plant of TNB treatment showed a higher plant height from the 2<sup>nd</sup> week than that of TN treatment. The plant in the TNB treatment had 107 cm height at the 12<sup>th</sup> week, while the plant of the TN treatment had a height of 93 cm. This indicated that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens </span><span class="font6">inoculation to sweet sorghum improved 15% to the plant height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The total dry weight biomass in TN and TNB treatments were 5.0 and 8.0 g/plant, respectively, indicating that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font6"> inoculation improved 40% of the biomass production (Fig.2). The root dry weight biomass in TN and TNB treatments were 1.1 and 2.7 g/plant, while the shoot dry weight biomass were 3.8 and 5.3 g/plant, respectively, as shown in Fig.2. In contrast to the control without inoculation (TN), there was a 39% increase rate for shoot, and a 250% increase rate for root, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The results indicated that sweet sorghum could survive and grow well in the mercury contaminated soil, and its growth was promoted with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font6"> inoculation. As the root in TNB treatment had dry weight biomass about 2.5 times of that in TN treatment,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the promotion of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens </span><span class="font6">inoculation to sorghum plant growth is possibly through promotion to the root growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font6"> is a soil-borne bacterium that, in nature, is capable of inserting a defined fragment of its DNA into the genome of dicotyledonous plants, and can cause disease in more than 90 families of dicotyledonous plants (Valentine, 2003; Hao </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">. 2012). However, not all </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font6"> were pathogenic, some were beneficial to assist rhizobia nodulating with legumes and promote plant growth (De Lajudie 1999; Hao </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">. 2012).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The results in this study showed that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font6"> I<sub>29</sub>Isolate was a plant growth promoting endophytic bacterium. Our results were supported by the findings of Hao </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">. (2012), who reported that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font6"> (CCNWGS0286) displayed a significant increase in biomass production over that without inoculation in a zinc contaminated environment, and also found that phytohormones, were the dominant factor in enhancing plant growth in contaminated soil.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Mercury concentration in the sweet sorghum</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">Mercury concentrations in different parts of the plants are shown in Table 2. As shown, for TN treatment, the mercury concentration in root, shoot and whole plant were 2.62, 1.19 and 1.62 mg/kg, respectively. For TNB treatment, the mercury concentration in roots, shoots and whole plants were 3.10, 1.19 and 1.72 mg/kg, respectively. The concentration in roots was more than 2 times that in shoots for both TN and TNB treatments. The mercury concentration in the sweet sorghum in this study reached a very high level compared to other common crops, although it was lower than some wild plant species in Indonesia such as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lindernia crustacea</span><span class="font6"> (L.) F., and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Paspalum conjugatum</span><span class="font6"> L. reported by Muddarisna </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">.(2013). It was also found that the shoot/root concentration ratio was much higher than some of phytoremediation potential plants such as</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Indian mustard and Chinese brake fern (Su </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">. 2007), indicating that the sweet sorghum possibly had a higher mercury translocation potential from root to shoot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, no promotion effect on mercury concentration of sweet sorghum was found with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens </span><span class="font6">inoculation in the current field experiment. This result confirmed with the findings by Prijiabada </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">.(1999) that inoculation of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Brassica juncea </span><span class="font6">with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">fluorescent peseudomonads</span><span class="font6"> did not promoted heavy metal uptake ability of the plant. However, the result was different from the observation with a pot cultural experiment by Utami </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font6">. (2013), who reported that inoculation of chromium enhancing rhizobacteria increased mercury content in sweet sorghum up to about 6 times, but did not promoted plant growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Phytoremediation potential of the sweet sorghum</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Phytoremediation capacity of plants to soil heavy metals is generally decided by the heavy metal accumulation amount of plants, which can be calculated by multiplying plant weight with its mercury content.

As there no difference in mercury content of sweet sorghum between TN and TNB (Table 1.), the increase of the accumulation amount was contributed by promotion of plant growth with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens </span><span class="font7">inoculation. With AT inoculation, it was observed a big increase of mercury accumulation amount in root, but a small increase in shoot. This indicates that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> inoculation mainly promoted mercury accumulation in root, and therefore resulted in a smaller shoot/root ratio compared with those without </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens </span><span class="font7">inoculation.

<p><span class="font7">According to the plantation density of sweet sorghum in this study (66,700 plants per ha), it was estimated that the phytoremediation efficiency (phytoextraction yield) of mercury was 414 mg/ha for sorghum without </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font7">, and 934 mg/ha for sorghum with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> inoculation as shown in Table 4</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font7"> Compared without </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> inoculation, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> inoculation promoted the phytoremediation efficiency at increasing rates of 2.3 times for the whole plant, 1.6 times for shoot, and 3.2 times for root, respectively. Although plants generally have low mercury uptake as mercury usually has a low availability in the soils, the present study found that sweet sorghum could accumulate mercury at a considerable level. The phytoremediation efficiency of sweet sorghum obtained in the present study compared with the results by Rodriguez </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">.(2005) who reported that the best mercury phytoextraction yield is obtained for barley reaching up to 719 mg/ha.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It is a reasonable way to regard the contaminated soils as a potentially recoverable resource for both remediation and utilization. So far, many studies on phytoremediation have mainly focused on accumulator or hyperaccumulating plants. Actually, it is difficult to convince the local people, especially in developing countries, to grow special accumulators in the contaminated fields for the sole purpose of soil remediation unless they could obtain financial income. The present study showed that the sweet sorghum had high potential for phytoremediation. As sweet sorghum can be used feedstock for biofuel, it could bring income to the remediators or the owners of the contaminated sites. Considering the economic effects of the biofuel plants, the sweet sorghum were possibly a promising way for both utilization and remediation of contaminated sites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The experimental results and their discussions allow us to conclude that the sweet sorghum variety KCS105 could be considered a suitable candidate energy crop for phytoremediation of mercury contaminated soil. It was able to grow well in the mercury contaminated soil and had considerable mercury accumulation ability in root and shoot. The phytoremediation efficiency estimated in this experiment was approximately 414 mg/ha without </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> inoculation, and 934 mg/ha with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span><span class="font7"> inoculation. The current field experiment also showed that the increase of mercury accumulation by the sweet sorghum with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Agrobacterium tumefaciens </span><span class="font7">inoculation was not from the increase of mercury concentration in plant, but from the increase of biomass production. As sweet sorghum is also a biofuel crop, which can bring income for the owners of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">contaminated sites, thus, the present study primarily provided valuable data supporting the use of biofuel plants in phytoremediation of mercury contaminated soil.</span></p>
