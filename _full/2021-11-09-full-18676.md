<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">Among the types of insects that have been reported to be pests on cabbage, there are two types that are the most important pests of cabbage in Indonesia namely the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Plutella xylostella</span><span class="font7"> Linn. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) that attatcks leaves and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Crocidolomia pavonana</span><span class="font7"> Fab. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) that attack the crops. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostell </span><span class="font7">is the main cabbage (key pest) on cabbage plantation at high altitude. They commonly attack cabbage before the development of crops, by attacking underpart of leaf tissues and leaving the upper epidermal tissues as white nets. Meanwhile, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C pavonana</span><span class="font7"> attacks cabbage plants when the crops are formed, damaging leaves in the form of holes, and if they attack on primordial tissues, result in plant to stop growing. If there is no control to the plantation for both pests, particularly in the dry season, can result in crop failure .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sembel </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font7">. , (1994) states that the level of damage caused by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> can</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">reach 34.8 % , and when the larvae of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> attack cabbage at the same time as the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Crocidolomia pavonana</span><span class="font7"> larvae, result in reduction of crop products by 79.81 % . Therefore, pest control has to be based on ecological and economic approaches, do not pollute the environment and safe for the consumers. One concept of pest control which is based on ecological and economic approach is integrated pest management (IPM).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Management of plant pests control should be based on observations of the pest density, stadia of pests and pest species, rather than using pesticides directly. Kumarawati (2013) states that the cabbage moth </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Plutella xylostella</span><span class="font7"> already started to live in cabbage at 4 weeks after planting (WAP), and the population reached a peak at the age of 8 weeks. While, the cabbage crop caterpillars </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Crocidolomia pavonana</span><span class="font7"> has begun attacking cabbage plants when the plants aged 6 WAP, and the highest population density found when the cabbage</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ISSN ONLINE: 9 772303 337 008</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">were 10 (WAP) at the age of 10 MST cabbage. However, there is no information relating to the attacks succession pattern between the two types of these pests, so studies related to this matter would be very useful. If there is succession it would be interesting to know whether it was caused by the plant content or due to the nature of the pests. This is very importance in order to find the best way to control them, both in terms of time and model that will be implemented. Understanding the succession pattern between </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Plutella xylostella</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Crocidolomia pavonana</span><span class="font7"> on cabbage will provide appropriate time and techniques of controling them. This is a problem that needs to be explored in terms of its understanding of pest target. The information of population succession patterns of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Plutella xylostella</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Crocidolomia pavonana</span><span class="font7"> on cabbage is important in terms of their interactions. Plant phenology has shown that plants provide different habitat and niche for cabbage leaf-eating pests. Although both pests, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xy</span><span class="font7">lostella and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C. pavonana</span><span class="font7"> exist on the same plant , but they occupied different resources.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>MATERIALS AND METHODS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">This study was conducted to determine the pest population succession patterns of of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C. pavonana </span><span class="font7">under field conditions. The Experiment was conducted in August 2013, in the area of vegetable production centers in Pancasari Village , District of Sukasada , Buleleng , which are endemic areas of P. xylostella and C. pavonana. Cabbage plants were prepared on an area of 100 m2. Cabbages were planted with a distance of 50 cm x 50 cm, so there are 400 cabbage plants in the area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cabbage cultivation was done in accordance with local practice, but without the use of pesticides, so naturally enable a wide range of organisms (including insect pests and their natural enemies) associated with cabbage plants.In order to determine the succession pattern of C. pavonana P. xylostella in cabbage, the plant was determined in such that the plants evenly in field with an adequate amount. In this experiment, 100 plants were employed which has been selected using a U-shaped random sampling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Observation of the plant age and the pest population density (egg, larva, pupa, and imago) of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C. pavonana </span><span class="font7">were caried out weekly from the first cabbage were planted until harvesting. Observations were made on a fixed sample of plants (plant sample has been determined before the observations and the observations made on the same sample plants until the experiment was completed). The density of egg, nymph, pupa, and imago of both insect pests were tabulated according to the observation time (to show the plant age / plants phenology) to determine the pattern of succession occurring of both pests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>The populations succession pattern of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">C. pavonana</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> on Cabbage</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">The results of the two main pest species compositions that attack cabbage plants showed that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> dominated plant aged 1-5 weeks after planting (WAP), but when cabbage plant were more than 5 weeks old, they were dominated by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C. pavonana</span><span class="font7"> (Figure 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These results demonstrated that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> are pests that attack plants in the vegetative phase which damage the leaves,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THE POPULATION SUCCESSION PATTERNS OF CABBAGE MAIN PEST </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Plutella xylostella</span><span class="font1"> L.

<p><span class="font7">so it is known as the leaf cabbage moth. The results also proved that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C. pavonana</span><span class="font7"> are pests that attack cabbage crop after crop formation, that is known as cabbage crop pests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The present of pest populations of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> on plants over 12 time observations consisted of egg, larva, pupa, and imago stages. The results of the field observations of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> found that the eggs began to occupy the cabbage plants after one week old, while the larvae </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> was found on cabbage plants in two weeks after plantation, with 11 individuals/100 plants. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Plutella xylostella </span><span class="font7">pupae began to be observed in two week old cabbage plants, with 7 indivuduals/100 plants, and imago were established on cabbage plants in three weeks after planting with the number of 2 individuals/100 plants. The population of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> larvae reached a peak when plants were 7 WAP, with 41 individuals over 100 plants (0.41 birds per plant). In the 8<sup>th</sup> weeks of observation, the population of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">larvae began to decline, and there was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> was observed when the plants were 12 weeks old (Figure 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7">, the present of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C. pavonana</span><span class="font7"> in cabbage plants also found as eggs, larvae, pupae and imago stages. The population of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C. pavonana</span><span class="font7"> larvae was first observed when the cabbages were four weeks old (33 individual / 100 plants). The number of larvae reached a peak when the plants were 10 WAP, which were 260 individuals in 100 plants (2.6 larvae/plant ). The pupae was observed when the plants were 6 WAP (3pupae / 100plants), and imago when the plants were 8 WAP (1 imago/100 plants).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The presence of both pests on cabbage plants was dominated by larval stage. The larvae increased significantly in cabbage plants 5 weeks after of planting, which were 35 larvae of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> and 56 larvae of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C. pavonana</span><span class="font7">. At this plant development time, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C. pavonana</span><span class="font7"> was started to dominate the plants. The number of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> started to decrease when</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Based on this field study, it can be stated that before the cabbage plants forming crops, the plants were dominated by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7">, but when the crops have been formed the plants were dominated by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C. pavonana</span><span class="font7">, and its domination has begun to decline when plants were 5 weeks old. The substitution of P. xylostella by C. pavonana occurred when plants were 8 weeks old.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">The succession population patterns of P. xylostella to C. pavonana on cabbage plants occur in 8 weeks after planting. P. xylostella dominated the plants cabbage in 1-5 weeks after planting (WAP), then shifted by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C. pavonana</span><span class="font7"> after the plants were older than 5 weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Suggestion</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Based on the result of this study, it can be suggested that further research can be conducted to examine the usage of succession patterns of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">P. xylostella</span><span class="font7"> dan </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C. pavonana</span><span class="font7"> in controlling pests on cabbage plantations.</span></p>
