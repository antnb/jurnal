<p><span class="font9">lant pathogens are a major challenge</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">P</span><span class="font8">of plant growth and development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They can seriously affect growth, production, </span><span class="font10">and quality of agricultural crops. Plants exhibit various sorts of acquired resistance enabling them to overcome the invasion of the vast majority of potential pathogens Jones and Takemoto, 2004, Muthamilarasan and Prasad, 2013). The major trends of specialists to protect plants are disease control and developing resistant varieties. Nonetheless, improved resistance of pathogens to pesticides and fungicides, environmental and health concerns related to agro--‐‑chemical and long and costly breeding programs are considered major obstacles limiting the traditional plant protection methods Duvick, 2005, Lopes et al., 2012, De La Fuente, 2013, Nicholls and Altieri, 2013, Sierotzki and Scalliet, 2013). When interact with pathogens, plants activate defense reactions upon the recognition of small, structurally conserved motif molecules within many microbial species. These molecules are called microbe associated molecular patterns or pathogen associated molecular patterns MAMPs or PAMPs) Jones and Takemoto, 2004, Kouzai et al., 2013). Defense reactions lead to acquired resistance if they were sufficient and well--‐‑timed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">or can be overcome by the attacking pathogens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Elicitors are agents that are able to induce </span><span class="font9">plant’s resistance. The term ‘elicitor’ was </span><span class="font10">originally used for compounds that induce </span><span class="font9">accumulation of antimicrobial phytoalexins in </span><span class="font10">plants,and is now commonly applied to agents stimulating any type of defense response Keen and Bruegger, 1977). An increasingly growing interest of scientists to explore new elicitors of plant resistance and understanding the molecular and biochemical basis of their action, is aiming at fostering plant protection strategies. Elicitors were extracted from bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, sea algae and plants or even chemically synthesized Nurnberger, 1999, Walters and Fountaine, 2009, Armana and Ul Qader, 2012).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Elicitor applications lead to resistance reactions including; the production of reactive oxygen species ROS), reactive nitrogen species RNS), production of phytoalexins, induction of hypersensitive reaction HR), callose deposition, lignin accumulation and expression of resistance related genes Doke and Tomiyama, 1980, Takemoto et al., 1999, Matsukawa et al., 2013, Monjil et al., 2013, Takeuchi et al., 2013). Elicitors can be species specific or nonspecific, and can induce resistance both locally and systemically. For example, pretreatment of oligogalacturonides produced by partial enzymatic degradation of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">cell wall of citrus fruit rinds on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Ara bidopsis thaliana </span><span class="font9">induced resistance reactions and the plants’ resistance against </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Botrytis cinerea</span><span class="font9"> Klarzynski et al., 2003, Suárez et al., 2013). The first chemical resistance activator, Probenazole, was registered in Japan as Oryzemate in 1975, and since then many other chemical and biological activators have been developed, including ASM, registered as Bion and Actigard Syngenta), Milsana </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reynoutria sacalinensis</span><span class="font9"> extract; KHH BioScience), Elexa chitosan; SafeScience) and Messenger harpin protein; Plant Health Care) Walters et al., 2013). In this work, the eliciting ability of a crude water extract of the brown sea algae </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Saragassum fusiforme</span><span class="font9">) was analysed for inducing ROS production in tomato </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Solanum lycopersicum</span><span class="font9">cv. Lady First) and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Nicotiana benthamiana</span><span class="font9"> plants. In addition, the ability of the extract to induce the resistance of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">S. lycopersicum</span><span class="font9">and</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">N. benthamiana </span><span class="font9">against oomycete and fungal pathogens was also evaluated.</span></p>

The experiment was repeated three times with similar results. Three plants were used in each experiment. Representative photographs were taken 7 dpi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Following, we investigated whether algal elicitor prior applications lead to diminished--‐‑ severity of powdery mildew disease on tomato plants. Elicitor--‐‑treated </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">S.lycopersicum</span><span class="font9"> plants were introduced into a growth chamber containing other plants infected with the air born pathogen </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Oidium spp</span><span class="font9">. Figure 3 shows that the severity of powdery mildew on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">S.lycopersicum</span><span class="font9"> plant leaves was noticed less in the case of algal elicitor--‐‑treated plants compared to the control. Prior applications of algal elicitor have lead to reduced average disease severity on treated plants. The largest protection was noticed at the end of our tests i.e. 12 days after disease introduction Figure 3--‐‑a). Powdery mildew disease incidence and severity were delayed and reduced on algal elicitor treated plants Figure 3--‐‑b and c). Obviously, we have no means of investigating the direct effect of algal elicitor on the obligate biotroph </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Oidium</span><span class="font9"> spp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Powdery mildew and late blight are considered among the major diseases threatening tomato culture around the world. Tomato powdery mildew caused by </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Oidium</span><span class="font9"> spp. is a relatively newly reported disease. Kashimoto et al. 2003) reported susceptibility of all commercial tomato cultivars available in Japan to powdery mildew caused by </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Oidium neolycopersici</span><span class="font9">. All the cultivar showed highest level of susceptibility. Matsuda et al. 2005) revealed fungicide--‐‑tolerant isolates of tomato powdery mildew on naturally infected tomato leaves, indicating the necessity of alternative measures to control the pathogen. Late blight is a devastating disease of tomato as well. Once an unprotected tomato crop field, greenhouse, and/or plastic--‐‑cover cultures) is infected by </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">P. infestans,</span><span class="font9"> the whole crop can be destroyed within 7 to 10 days Fry, 2008). Economic losses may be in the form of reduced yield, lower quality of the fruit, diminished storability and increased cost associated with fungicide applications Fontem et al., 1996). Alternative measures to control tomato powdery mildew and late blight seem vital. Induced resistance is an increasingly growing alternative method of plant protection. Our studied algal elicitor is able to induce resistance of tomato cv. Lady First plants leading to reduce powdery</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">mildew and late blight severities. However, it is obvious that algal product treatment did not completely suppress infection and disease development. Kuc 1982) reported that elicitor--‐‑ induced resistance rarely leads to complete pathogen control, but reduce lesion size and/ or number instead. However, reduced severity of the pathogen might lead to easier control. An elicitor added to certain fungicides, amplified the fungicides efficacy, which leaded to achieving the intended antifungal activity by applying highly reduced amount of fungicide Bounatesta et al., 2013). Purification of algal elicitor as well as combinations with other plant protectants might show better control of tomato powdery mildew and late blight diseases.</span></p>
