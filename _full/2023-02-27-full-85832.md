<p><span class="font5">ABSTRACT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This study aims to estimate the impact of the implementation of Islamic work ethics by halal-certified restaurant employees on the commitment and performance of organizations in DKI Jakarta in the year of 2018. This study used Partial Least Square (PLS) on 161 samples from halal restaurant employees in DKI Jakarta. It found that Islamic work ethic has statistically proven to positively affect affective commitment, continuous commitment, and normative commitment. Islamic work ethic is also statistically proven to have a positive effect on employee performance. Affective commitments and continuance commitments have not been shown to affect employee performance. Normative commitment variables have been shown to have a positive effect on employee performance. Halal restaurant owners must improve the implementation of Islamic work ethics in the work environment, provide training based on Islamic work ethics, apply organizational values based on Islamic values in order to increase work effectiveness, and make DKI Jakarta a halal tourist destination in Indonesia.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Islamic work ethic can be the main key to build motivation and direct halal restaurant human resources to be able to work optimally based on Islamic values. As stated by several researchers in previous studies (Hayati &amp;&nbsp;Caniago, 2012; Rawwas et al., 2018; Salahudin et al., 2016; Yousef, 2000; 2001). In general, it can affect motivational variables such as employee organizational commitment, job satisfaction, career development, performance and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This study will examine the relationship between Islamic work ethics, organizational commitment consisting of affective commitment, continuance commitment, normative commitment, and job performance. This is because the Islamic work ethic was not first developed through the company itself,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">but has been attached to Islam since its presence on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In recent years, work ethics has become a research topic that has received much attention by the researchers such as Abdi et al (2014); Abbasi et al. (2013); Manan et al. (2013); Marri et al. (2012); Mohammad et al. (2016) conduct research to measure Islamic Work Ethics in a company or organization with some variables involved such as internal motivation, commitment, performance, and few work efficiency variables. According to Rokhman (2010), today's work ethic is becoming increasingly important so that ethical issues become a popular topic in the business community around the world. This arises because in recent years there has been a lot of pollution associated with a lack of ethics in business behavior (Rokhman, 2010). Instilling work ethics at the organizational level will provide many benefits for the organization and will certainly attract interest and attention to work ethics. Since the 19th century classical economists and sociologists have observed that each</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">region has very different work culture norms and explained that these differences are the main cause of productivity inequality and result in inequality of people's income (Forquesato, 2016). Therefore it is necessary to have an ethical foundation in work to increase productivity and performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to Haldar &amp;&nbsp;Pareek (2009) organizational commitment is an effort made by the organization to get more attention from employees who have a relationship with the organization's ability to produce something in accordance with the expectations of employees and the organization. Steers (1977) revealed that commitment is related to the desire to stay in an organization and is also related to motivation, role clarity, and employee abilities (Mowday et al., 1982). Organizational commitment conveyed by Mowday et. Al (1982) has the following characteristics: (1) strong trust and a good understanding of the goals and values of the organization; (2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">readiness to work hard; and (3) a strong desire to stay in the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Organizational commitment defined as the relative power of an identified person and involvement in the organization (Porter et al., 1973). Organizational commitment is characterized by at least three related factors: (1) a strong belief in and acceptance of the goals and values of the organization, (2) a desire to drive great efforts for the benefit of the organization, (3) a strong desire to maintain membership in the organization. (Mowday, et al., 1979). Desler (2008) defines commitment as: 1) Feelings of identification with the organization's mission; 2) Sense of being involved with organizational tasks; 3) A sense of royalty and love for the organization as a place to live and work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Based on the concept of Organizational Commitment developed by Allen &amp;&nbsp;Meyer (1991) organizational commitment is categorized into three types of commitment, namely: 1) Affective Commitment: When employees feel a strong emotional</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">attachment to the organization, they identify with the goals and values of their organization; 2) Continuance Commitment: When employees feel that they need to stay in their organization because the loss they feel from leaving the organization is felt to outweigh the benefits they think they will gain in the new job, so continuance commitment occurs; 3) Normative Commitment: When employees feel obligated to their organization, even if they are not happy in their roles, or even if they want to demand better, then normative commitment occurs. An employee feels that he or she should stay with the organization because it is the right thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The three commitments state that employees have the possibility to stay in an organization with different motives, namely based on personal desires, needs, and also obligations or awareness of each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each person has the potential to act in a variety of activities. This can be obtained from birth (naturally) or by learning. Although a person has the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">potential to behave in a certain way, this behavior is only manifested at certain times. Such potential is also called ability. While the form of expression of potential is called performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Performance is a term that comes from the word Job Performance or Actual Performance (Murti &amp;&nbsp;Hudiwinarsih, 2012). The work achieved by a person in carrying out tasks in accordance with predetermined criteria or standards both in quality and quantity is called performance (Taurisa &amp;&nbsp;Ratnawati, 2010). Performance is a multidimensional construct that includes many factors that influence it. A number of experts explain a variety of different factors that affect a person's performance. According to Islam &amp;&nbsp;to Islam &amp;&nbsp;Ismail (2008) shows that employee performance is generally influenced by two factors, namely: 1) Internal factors are factors that affect performance that come from within the employees themselves, such as job satisfaction or organizational commitment; 2) External factors are defined as factors that affect</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">performance that comes from outside the employee. Examples are work safety and security, organizational culture, leadership style, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meanwhile, according to Ayu &amp;&nbsp;Suprayetno (2009) individual employee performance can be influenced by three factors. The three factors are: 2) Individual ability in carrying out work; 2) Level of effort exerted (desire to work); 3) Organizational support Employee performance can be reduced if one of the three factors is not present. Meanwhile, if these three factors are present in the employee, then the employee's performance can be improved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There have been many studies that have focused on ethics in the workplace, but in reality, unethical work behavior continues to occur, such as corruption, cheating, dishonesty, sexual violence and so on (Abdi et al., 2014). A company or organization can collapse if there is a work ethic chaos in it, as happened to Enron at the end of 2001. The world's largest energy company went bankrupt because of business governance</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">practices that ignore ethics and integrity. Therefore, this study aims to determine the application of Islamic work ethics by employees who work in halal-certified restaurants which will affect organizational commitment and impact on the performance of these employees, and also to find empirical evidence of the relationship between Islamic work ethics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">restaurant in this study is a restaurant that has an official halal certificate from the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) both in terms of processing the food served or the operation of the restaurant as a whole. The research area covers Central Jakarta, North Jakarta, South Jakarta, East Jakarta, and West Jakarta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">RESEARCH METHODS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Data used in this research is primary data which collected by using questionnaires and about 168 people involved. This study uses a purposive sampling technique to achieve this goal. Data type is cross section data which collected only in 2018 for one shoot data. Questionnaires were distributed to participants employees of halal restaurants in DKI Jakarta Province. The halal restaurants referred to in this study include several halal restaurants that sell food and drinks in the DKI Jakarta Province. The term halal</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Islamic work ethic variable was measured using an instrument developed by Ali &amp;&nbsp;Al Owaihan (2008). The scale used in this questionnaire is a Likert scale, which is a measurement scale with five response categories ranging from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree” which requires respondents to determine their degree of agreement or disagreement with each of a series of statements regarding the stimulus object (Maholtra, 2009). The instrument for measuring Islamic work ethic is measured using a 5-point Likert</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">scale. The higher the resulting number, the more it supports the hypothesis proposed by the author. The instrument for measuring Islamic work ethics consists of 17 items. Furthermore, the organizational commitment variable was measured using an instrument developed by Meyer and Allen (1991). The instrument for measuring organizational commitment consists of 24 items where each dimension of organizational commitment has 8 items. As for Performance is measured using 6 items based on previous measurements made by Vignaswaran (2008).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This research uses Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis test using SmartPLS 3.0 software. According to Haryono (2017), PLS can be used if the data size is small while the relationship to be described is relatively complex. The use of SEM-PLS can only use 30-100 samples (the bigger the better) while CBSEM (AMOS and Lisrel) ranges from 200-800 samples. Besides, data processing using Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis, researchers also conducted validity and reliability tests assisted by SPSS software before</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">distributing questionnaires to ensure the measuring instruments used were valid and reliable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the results of the distribution of 200 questionnaires, the researchers got as many as 161 respondents who were collected from various sources employees of halal-certified restaurants in DKI Jakarta Province. Most respondents in this study were male, as many as 84 people (52.17%), while the number of female respondents was 77 people (47.83%). The composition of male and female respondents is indeed quite balanced.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The education level of the respondents is grouped into three categories, namely SMA, SMK, D3/Diploma, and S1/Bachelor. The majority of research respondents have a vocational education background as many as 84</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">people (35.4%), followed by high school as many as 57 people (52.2%), diploma education (D3) as many as 1 person (0.2%), and the last rank was undergraduate education as many as 19 people (11.8%). The number of high school and vocational high school graduates is due to the main target of respondents being employees of DKI Jakarta halal restaurants who do not require a high enough educational qualification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Respondents' ages were grouped into three categories, namely &lt;&nbsp;25 years, 2635 years, 36-45 years, and &gt;&nbsp;46 years. Based on table 4.3 the majority of research respondents were under 25 years old, namely 82 people (51%), followed by 26-35 years as many as 78 people (48%), 36-45 years as many as 1 person (1%), and there were no respondents aged more than 46 years. This is related to most halal restaurant employees who are still high school/vocational high school graduates. Moreover, most of the respondents are still in the status of crew or staff who really need a young</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and energetic person. Moreover, their job desk has to serve consumers from ordering, preparing products, delivering products, and managing product stock. All activities carried out certainly require a prime physical condition.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Fitriana &amp;&nbsp;Kusmaputri (2014) also found a significant positive relationship</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">between Islamic work ethics and affective commitments and identified that the higher the Islamic work ethic applied, the greater the affective commitment that arises and vice versa. Similar results were also obtained by Salahudin et al. (2016) found a significant positive relationship between Islamic work ethics and affective commitment. Islamic work ethics and organizational commitment (IWE and OC) have a positive and significant relationship and have a high correlation (Imam et al., 2013; AFLAH et al., 2021). Chaudhary et al. (2021) also shows that affective commitment is positively related to Islamic work ethics. Research conducted by Udin et al. (2022) show that Islamic work ethics were confirmed to be positively and significantly associated with affective commitment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Salahudin et al. (2016) which found that Islamic work ethics positively affects the continuance commitment. Continuance commitment refers to commitments related to the costs that employees may feel if they leave the organization (Khan &amp;&nbsp;Jam, 2010). Shalahuddin et al. (2016)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">suggests that a high Islamic work ethic will result in a high organizational commitment and indicates that the implementation of Islamic work ethics can help to get a high commitment from workers to an organization. Imam, et al (2013) stated that the two variables studied by Islamic work ethics and organizational commitment (IWE and OC) have a positive and significant relationship and have a high correlation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Salahudin et al (2015) found that Islamic Work Ethics has a positive effect on normative commitments. According to Cho &amp;&nbsp;Huang (2012), normative commitment is the moral responsibility of workers to maintain in the organization. This relates to the meaning of Islamic work ethics where being in an organization is part of the responsibility to contribute to a society that encourages commitment to work. Research conducted by Imam, et al (2013) suggests that the two variables studied by Islamic work ethics and organizational commitment (IWE and OC) have a positive and significant relationship and have a high correlation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shalahuddin et al. (2016) suggest that a high Islamic work ethic will result in a high organizational commitment and indicate that the implementation of Islamic work ethics can help to get a high commitment from workers to an organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hayati and Caniago (2012) found a strong and positive relationship between Islamic work ethics and employee performance. Improving Islamic work ethics can lead to increased performance. Mansoori (2012) stated that Islamic work ethics improve employee performance. Islamic Work Ethics focuses on placing dedication of trust and worship to God as well as good behavior and integrity with others. Abdi et al. (2014) also found Islamic work ethics have an influence on employee performance and have positive relationships. Work ethics have been tested in the organizational science literature and tested as predictors of work outcomes. Research conducted by Abdi, et al (2014) also found that Islamic work ethics have an influence on performance and are positively</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">correlated with it. Al-Aidaros et al. (2013) who mentioned Islamic work ethics as a very important factor for the development and success of Muslim communities and their organizations. Research of Raja et al. (2019) also shows that IWE has a positive and significant effect on employee performance. IWE, intrinsic motivation, psychological capital have positive and significant effect on employee performance (Din et al., 2019; Qasim et al., 2022; Hamzah et al., 2021; Rozikan, 2022).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The results of this study turned out to show no relationship between affective commitments and employee performance. The results of this study are not in line with previous studies (Khan &amp;&nbsp;Jam, 2010; Tolentino, 2013) which shows that all dimensions of organizational commitment including affective commitment have a significant effect on performance. Tolentino (2013) put forward the results of his research which showed that affective commitment significantly affects employee performance. Leroy et al. (2012) show that organizational</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">commitment is significantly related to employee performance. According to to Islam &amp;&nbsp;Ismail (2008) shows that employee performance in general is influenced by several factors, one of which is internal factors that come from within the employees themselves, such as job satisfaction or organizational commitment. In the case of halal restaurant employees in DKI Jakarta, there is no influence on affective commitment to employee performance because the majority of respondents are crew and high school / vocational school graduates who do not think too much about organizational goals or values. They tend to focus more on the work they do on a day-to-day basis. They tend to perform well over transactional relationships with the company. They will benefit financially for what they have done. This will be different in more structural positions that shape their commitment to the organization based on the company's values and goals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The results of this study turned out to show no relationship between</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">continuous commitment to employee performance. Continuous commitment refers to commitments related to the costs that employees may feel if they leave the organization (Khan &amp;&nbsp;Jam, 2010). When employees feel that they need to stay in their organization because the loss they experienced by leaving it is felt to outweigh the benefits they thought they would gain in a new job, so a continuous commitment occurs. Continuous commitment is related to an awareness of the culture that when leaving the organization or showing a profit and loss consideration in employees about wanting to continue working or leaving the organization. Ongoing commitment is the awareness of the impossibility of choosing another social identity or other behavioral alternative due to the threat of great harm. Employees who work on this commitment tend to stay in the organization because they need to do so because there are no other options.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the case of halal restaurant employees in DKI Jakarta, there is no influence on continuous commitment to performance</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">because the majority of respondents are crew members who usually do not have a commitment to last long in a restaurant company. They tend to perform well on transactional relationships with the company. They will benefit financially for what they have done. They can go out at any time and move to a similar company. Employees with continuance commitment will remain in the organization because they feel the need for the organization. Employees who have this commitment will consider the more benefits of finding another job. The lack of clarity from future job prospects also tends to make employees not guarantee to stay in the company for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In contrast to the variables of affective commitment (AC) and sustainable commitment (CC), normative commitment (NC) has proven to have a positive effect on employee performance in halal restaurant employees in DKI Jakarta Province. Weiner (2009) states that normative commitment as a feeling to stay in an organization because it</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">must be responsible for staying then improves performance. Research conducted by Khan &amp;&nbsp;Jam, (2010); Tolentino (2013) shows that all dimensions of organizational commitment including normative commitment have a significant effect on performance. According to Islam &amp;&nbsp;Ismail (2008), employee performance in general is influenced by several factors, one of which is internal factors that come from within the employees themselves, such as job satisfaction or organizational commitment. Normative commitments reflect the imperative for employees to remain in the organization arising from obligations or duties in the organization. When employees feel they have an obligation towards their organization, even if they do not feel happy in their role, or even if they want to demand better, so normative commitments occur. An employee feels that he should stay with the organization because it is the right thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Managerial Implications</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The results of this study have important implications for the halal restaurant business in DKI Jakarta. Based on the results of the study, owners of halal restaurants in DKI Jakarta should try to improve the implementation of Islamic work ethics in the work environment. Halal restaurant businesses need to provide training facilities, both formal and informal, where employees are imbued with the concepts of Islamic work ethics in order to increase commitment to the organization and employee performance. The application of Islamic ethics is expected to be able to create conformity with the company's values with the values adopted by employees. In the end, employees can contribute greatly in achieving organizational goals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition, an organizational culture that reflects Islamic values will also increase organizational commitment and to carry out work effectively. This is related to the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's plan to make Jakarta one of the halal tourism destinations in Indonesia, halal restaurant business</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">opportunities certainly very promising. Therefore, demands for human resource competence and food halal assurance through MUI halal certification are the main capital in capturing opportunities for the growth of the halal restaurant business, especially in DKI Jakarta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Limitations and Further Research</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This research was conducted in a limited way to study the application of the variables in the study by employees of halal-certified restaurants in DKI Jakarta Province, so that the generalization of these results to all employees of halal-certified restaurants in Indonesia may not be appropriate. In addition, the organizational commitment variable is not suitable for use among restaurant employees because the results of the study show that employees are less committed to the company where they work. Therefore, other variables such as religiosity, job satisfaction or intention to leave the company should be considered in future research. In addition, in further research, the construct of Islamic work ethics needs to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">be further developed so that it can truly represent an Islamic work ethic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the author, it is necessary to create a new scale for the Islamic work ethic variable because the one used in this study also still refers to the scale developed by Ali (1988) which was still used by Ali himself until 2008. That is, from 1988 to 2008 the scale Islamic work ethic has not developed. Although there are attempts to create a new scale in Islamic work ethics as done by Chanzanagh and Akbarnejad (2011). They say that the Islamic work ethic (IWE) developed by Ali is not much different from the Protestant work ethic (PWE) so it is not clear whether their scale measures IWE or PWE,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Islamic work ethic is statistically proven to have an effect on affective commitment to halal restaurant employees in DKI Jakarta. The relationship shown is positive. Islamic work ethic is statistically proven to have an effect on sustainable commitment to halal restaurant employees in DKI Jakarta. Islamic work ethic is statistically</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">proven to have an effect on normative commitment to Halal restaurant employees in DKI Jakarta. The relationship shown is positive. Islamic work ethic is statistically proven to have an effect on employee performance at Halal Restaurants in DKI Jakarta. The relationship shown is positive. Affective commitment is not proven to have an impact on the performance of Halal restaurant employees in DKI Jakarta because the majority of respondents are crew and SMA/SMK graduates who do not really think about the goals or values of the organization. They tend to focus more on the job desk they do every day. They tend to show good performance on transactional relationships with companies. Similar to affective commitment, continuance commitment was also not proven to have an effect on employee performance. This is because the majority of respondents are crew members who usually do not have a commitment to stay long in a restaurant company. They tend to show good performance on transactional relationships with companies. However,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the normative commitment variable is proven to have an effect on employee performance at Halal Restaurants in DKI Jakarta. This shows that the greater the application of normative commitment, the higher the employee's performance.</span></p>
