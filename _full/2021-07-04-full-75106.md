<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Translation text has very important role in tourism market since Bali become very popular in tourism world. One of translation text used as media for Bali tourism promotions is Why Bali is Known as ”The Island of Thousand Temples”. The text is written in two languages, namely English as the source language and Indonesian as the target language. There are several differences between the source and the target languages in formulating language as message. Such differences were analyzed from systemic functional linguistics point view. The theory used to analyze is the theory of clause of message taken from Halliday. This is qualitative research, namely by approaching the theory clause as message, theme and rheme. Themes of the clauses used in both of texts were compared and analyzed. The result of the research suggested that topical themes were mostly used in the source language, while textual theme was also found in the target language. The themes used in the target language get shifts which resulted to loss and again. The phenomenon causes between the source and the target gets far from equivalence which makes the readers/listeners have different interpretation to the message of the clauses.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Bali is very famous in tourism world because of the culture. However, many guests from other countries do not understand about culture which can be found in others since Balinese culture embeds with Hinduism developing in Bali. To comprehend Balinese culture, comprehending local language is needed much because the culture will be told through spoken or written media. In present time, language does not become obstacle to comprehend Balinese culture since there some kinds of media which promote Balinese culture by using two languages, English-Indonesia written texts such as: book, brochure, magazine, and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Text of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Why Bali is known as the “Island of a Thousand Temples”</span><span class="font3"> is one of written texts in a book which promotes Balinese culture in two languages, English-Indonesia. The book consists of number of topics which involve temples existing in Bali. The existence of the book helps either domestic or international guests who want to know about Bali. Therefore, the book cannot be ignored in the Balinese tourism promotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One the topics issued in the book is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Distinction of Kawitan Temple.</span><span class="font3"> The topic describes what </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kawitan</span><span class="font3"> temple is in two languages, English-Indonesian. The topic gives some advantages</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">for communities such as; (i) is useful for the persons who do not understand Balinese, they get information from English or Indonesia, (ii) is useful for persons who begin to study English by comparing the two languages. (iii) is very useful for students who concern to applied linguistics especially in contrastive analysis. For the students of linguistics, the text is viewed as an important subject matter since the clauses in the source language used to describe the information get shifts in the target language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Linguistically, the clauses used in the source and the target languages can be analyzed many aspects of linguistics. Language embeds social and culture, so the meaning of the language is resulted from social interaction (Halliday, 1978). Social and cultural aspects involve many aspects such as; (i) what is going on, what the topic is discussed, (ii) who speak, (iii) to whom speak, (iv) how to speak, and many others. Because of those aspects, it is very clear that one language is different from other languages. The differences are caused by social and cultural factors, individual factor as well. Social and cultural factors are found in the terms of the source and the target languages. There are a lot of terms from the source language which cannot be found in the target language. Semantic approach is used as tool of transferring meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In transferring meaning, typology of the two languages become concern for linguists since culture influences the structure of languages. In addition, personal character, background and others give contribution for language comparison. Based on those explanation, there are at least aspects which must be comprehended such as; (i) ability in understanding the source and the target language, (ii) ability to comprehend context of situation, (iii) ability comprehend the two ideologies (Bell, 1991).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In transferring meaning, the translator try to prevent the message conveyed through the clauses. However, as mentioned above, typology and the personal style in translating cause the differences of structure clauses in both languages in which the semantics embeds. It means that differences of structure cause the meaning to get shift. One of the different structures which can always be found in translation text is textual clause between the source and the target languages. Textual analysis is associated with clause of message, it is related how language is formulated as the message, it involves theme and rheme analysis (Halliday, 2014:88).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The translation text of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Distinction of Kawitan Temple</span><span class="font3"> contains many differences in structures of textual clauses. The differences make the meaning get shift from the source language into the target language. This research focuses on the analysis of sift in theme-rheme on translation </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Distinction of Kawitan Temple.</span><span class="font3"> The theory used to analysis for this research is the theory of clause of message proposed by Halliday (2014).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This research used qualitative research since the research concerns to phenomena in the translations and uses the theory as the base of analysis (Steen, 2007). The data were taken from the translation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Distinction of Kawitan Temple</span><span class="font3"> from the book of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bali is Known as the “Island of a Thousand Temples</span><span class="font3"> written by Wiana (2003). The text was chosen because the text contains number differences in clause as messages in which result to difference semantic analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The technique used to identify the data was by separating the start point of the clauses based on the theory of clause as message (Halliday, 2014:88). Both of the themes were compared from the theme point of view then themes were analysis based the theory of clause as message. The elements of the themes were construed based on the classes and the functions of lexes. The classes and the functions were identified based on the analysis of group and phrase from Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) proposed by Halliday, (2014:361).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Both of the clauses are presented in the paper. English clauses serve as the source language and Indonesian clauses serve as the target language. Both of the themes were analyzed then compared based on semantic approach. The semantic conveyed through the themes got shift. Those sifts were observed how far the meaning sifts happened in the target language.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Literature Review</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The aim of translation is to transfer the message from the source language into the target language by taking equivalence the meaning (Larson, 1998:3). The meaning of language is resulted from language in usage in which it involves social context, namely context of situation, context of culture and ideology, it is called as text (Halliday and Ruqaiya, 1999). From that statement, it is very clear that languages develop in area which culture and social aspects influence the meaning. Therefore, the source and the target languages have different meaning since every language has different social and aspects. Translation is a text functioning to bring the equivalence meaning instead of the exact meaning from the source language into the target language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SFL is the theory of linguistics which focuses on the meaning which involves language in usage. SFL views that social interaction and language play an important role to create the meaning. Every phenomenon that happens in communities can be analyzed from SFL point of view. Translation is one of phenomena that happen in communities. SFL can be used as tool to analyze translation. That is the reason, SFL is called as applied linguistics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In translation, linguistically, there are many aspects which can be seen as the analysis matter. Structure of theme and rheme of clauses become the prime concern for the research. Structure of theme and rheme focuses on how the language is formulated as start point. Halliday (2014) states that all of languages in the world applies theme and rheme. Theme occurs in the initial position of clause. Halliday emphasizes that theme of clause functions as (i) the purpose of the text, (ii) the relationship among participants, (iii) the kinds of the text. Those functions can be seen from three aspects, namely: topical theme, interpersonal theme, and textual theme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Topical theme is the theme of the clause comes in the Subject of the clause when we see clause traditionally. Theme as topical theme is filled with nominal group simplex or complex. Nominal group is constructed by number of aspects such as: (i) deictic, (ii) numerative, (iii) epithet, (iv) classifier, (v) thing, (vi) qualifier. When the topical theme is filled with nominal group, it is called unmarked theme. Nominal group is often in nominalization derived from participant, circumstance, and process. The density of nominal group is associated with the character and whom the text is for. Topical theme also involves circumstance. It can be in nominal group or preposition phrase. The topical theme happening in circumstance is called marked theme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Interpersonal theme is associated with languages used as social interaction. It involves modalities, yes or no question including the answer of the question, vocative clause, minor clause, and expletive clause. Interpersonal theme indicates that the text involve dialog to support the language expressed by the narrator. In other word, interpersonal theme is found in the narrative text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Textual theme is theme happening in conjunction or continuative. Textual theme concerns to the purpose of the text through the conjunction used to link from one clause to another clause. Halliday (2014) emphasizes the kinds of conjunction used as in a text in which it can be used to identify the aims of the text. Halliday emphasizes the functions of conjunction in a text such as: elaboration, extension, and enhancement. Elaboration conjunction functions how to elaborate the main idea conveyed through the first or the main clause. The existence of these conjunctions leads the listeners/readers comprehend the idea of the text. Extension conjunctions function to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">add in formation conveyed through the first or the main clauses. These conjunctions indicate that whether or not the information is accompanied with others. The enhancement conjunctions are related to circumstance such as: how, where, why, when, and condition.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Based on the research, there are seven themes getting shifts in the text of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Distinction of Kawitan Temple</span><span class="font3"> from the source into the target languages. The research describes the shifts found in the text as below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Text 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The source language</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">The temple in the family home</span><span class="font3"> is called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sanggah</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Merajan Kamulan</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The target language</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Tempat pemujaan leluhur di lingkungan keluarga inti</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> disebut Merajan Kamulan</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘The place where the ancestors are worshipped in the main family environment is called Merajan Kamulan’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The source language uses Theme </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the temple in the family home</span><span class="font3"> categorized as nominal group complex, hypotactic enhancement since the nominal group is expanded with circumstance stating place or location. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> functions as Deictic (Halliday, 2014:365) which indicates definite reference. In other word, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> above refers to entity related to the temple which was already mentioned before. Therefore, the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> embeds context of situation which is understood by both writer and the readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Theme in the target language </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tempat pemujaan leluhur di lingkungan keluarga inti </span><span class="font3">belongs to nominal group complex, hypotactic enhancement in which the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> mentioned in the source language is not found in the target language. It is very clear that the target language does not use Deictic. This is the reason that the target language gets loss. The nominal group </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">temple</span><span class="font3"> mentioned in the source language is translated into </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tempat pemujaan leluhur</span><span class="font3"> ‘place where we pray for ancestor’. The translation of the nominal group </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tempat pemujaan leluhur</span><span class="font3"> is the definition of the nominal group </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">temple</span><span class="font3"> so this phenomenon is called grammatical metaphor (Heyvaert, 2003:67). The source language is the metaphor in nominalization, while the translation is called the congruent since the translation is understood by more people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The nominal group </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">family home</span><span class="font3"> in the source language is translated into </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lingkungan keluarga inti</span><span class="font3"> ‘the main family environment’. The nominal group in the source language has head </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">home</span><span class="font3"> translated into </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lingkungan</span><span class="font3"> ‘environment’. It is very clear that the source and the target languages get shift in semantic perspective. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">home</span><span class="font3"> in the source languages has smaller scope than the translation </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">environment.</span><span class="font3"> Halliday et.al (2004) the source language is the taxonomy of the target language since </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">home</span><span class="font3"> is part of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lingkungan.</span><span class="font3"> The meaning conveyed through the translation becomes more general than it should be. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">inti</span><span class="font3"> ‘main’ is not found in the source language that is the reason the translation gets again (Larson, 1998).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Text 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The source language</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">The Balinese Hindu members</span><span class="font3"> name hilt a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kamulan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The target language</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Umat Hindu di Bali</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> menyebut bagian hulu itu Kamulan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘Hinduism in Bali call the hilt a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kamulan’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Semantically, the two themes are different. The two themes above can be described as follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The source language</span></p>
<table border="1">

<p><span class="font3">The target language</span></p>
<table border="1">

<p><span class="font3">Head</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font3">Classifier</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">
<p><span class="font3">Qualifier</span></p></td></tr>
</table>
<p><span class="font3">The theme in the source language consists two classifiers </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Balinese</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hindu,</span><span class="font3"> while the target language has one classifier, namely </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hindu.</span><span class="font3"> Classifier </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Balinese</span><span class="font3"> found in the source language is translated into </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">di Bali</span><span class="font3"> ‘in Bali’ functioning as qualifier since the translation functions to expand the head in circumstance. The qualifier realized by circumstance functions to limit the scope of the head. Therefore, semantically, the theme in the source language is interpreted as all of people who hold Hinduism wherever they live, while the theme found in the target language is interpreted as people who hold Hinduism and live in Bali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> functioning as deictic is not found the translation in the target language. The deictic serves as scope limitation of reference. Such deictic refers to context mentioned in previous clauses. Due to this phenomenon, the translation of theme is not equivalence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Text 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The source language</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The holy bible </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bhagawad Gita</span><span class="font3"> (IX, 25) tell us ………………</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The target language</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Di dalam Bhagawad Gita (IX, 25), disebutkan menyembah butha …………</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘In </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bhagawad Gita</span><span class="font3"> (IX, 25), it is said that worshiping butha ………………..’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those themes are different, in the source language, the theme is unmarked theme filled with nominal group functioning as sayer since the clause uses verbal process. In contrast, the theme in the target language is marked theme realized with circumstance location. From those themes, it is very clear that the translation is far from equivalence since the theme found in the source text functions as if the theme could do as what human does such as telling something. Whereas the theme found in the target language functions as circumstance. It means that the information or idea is available in the holy book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bhagawad Gita.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The theme in the source language </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Holy bible Bhagawad Gita</span><span class="font3"> is nominal group complex paratactic elaboration (Halliday, 2014:560) since the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">holy</span><span class="font3"> embeds the meaning of pure. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bible</span><span class="font3"> is associated with holy book which is used as guidance for the life. Therefore, the theme seems to be repetition which causes redundancy. The theme found in the target language is mentioned as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bhagawad Gita.</span><span class="font3"> This phenomenon makes the readers who do not understand about </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bhagawad Gita</span><span class="font3"> confused about the function of the book whether or not it is holy. From that explanation, the translation viewed from the theme does not make it clear between the source and the target languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Text 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The source language</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">The one that needs to be understood</span><span class="font3"> is the fact of worshiping </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">butha</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The target language</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Namun, yang perlu dipahami</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> adalah hakekat menyembah butha.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘However, what must be comprehended is principle of worshiping </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">butha</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The source language uses the theme in nominal group in which </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font3"> functions as head. The head is expanded with the relative clause. There two themes found in the target language, namely conjunction and noun clause. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> found in the source language and functioning as deictic is not found in the target language. The deictic functions to limit the method or way of doing something. Therefore, the existence of the deictic indicates that there is only one way that must be done to get understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As mentioned above, the themes in the target language are conjunction and noun clause. The conjunction used in the target language is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Namun</span><span class="font3"> ‘However’ indicating as extension conjunction (Halliday, 2014:613). The conjunction is textual theme which suggests adversative or contradiction between the first clause and the second clause. The function of the conjunction emphasizes the following suggestion or idea which must be done. The second theme is realized with nominal clause. Therefore, syntactically, the theme in the source language gets shift, that is from nominal group into clause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Semantically, the theme in the source language emphasizes the way of worshiping </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">butha</span><span class="font3">, while the theme in the target language emphasizes the basic concept of worshiping </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">butha.</span><span class="font3"> It is very clear that the message conveyed through the clause is deferent. In other word, the theme in the source language needs action, while the target language is comprehension about concept or purpose of worshiping </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">butha</span><span class="font3">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Text 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The source language</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Clearly, a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Padharman</span><span class="font3"> is a place to adore </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dewa/Pitara</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Ini sangat jelas bahwa Padharman</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> merupakan tempat menstanakan Dewa/Pitara.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘It is very clear that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Padharman</span><span class="font3"> is the place to adore </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dewa/Pitara’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The source language uses circumstance as marked theme. Based on the form the clause, the clause embeds interpersonal meaning since the clause contains proposition. The proposition can be seen from the usage of theme. The circumstance </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">clearly</span><span class="font3"> function as modality adjunct (Halliday, 2014:192). The circumstance states the expression related to writer’s angle. The writer emphasizes his belief based on the experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The target languages uses theme in relational process clause, intensive attribution (Halliday, 2014:268). The attributive is adjective associated with quality. The adjective derives from the circumstance used as the theme in the source language. The theme in the target language is superordinate clause in the clause complex. The rheme of the target language is embedded clause stating the definition of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Padharman</span><span class="font3"> built by Balinese Hindu communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The two themes above are different from syntactical point of view, namely the source language uses modal adjunct, while the target language uses theme as clause stating general perception. Semantically, the theme in the source language indicates writer’s view for the function of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Padharman.</span><span class="font3"> In contrast, the theme in the target language indicates general view. It means that all Balinese Hindu communities know the function of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Padharman.</span><span class="font3"> In other word, the theme in the target language states conventional perception. Those reasons make the themes of the source and the target languages not far from equivalence.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Based on the tables shown above, the theme used in the source language is nominal group that consists of deictic, epithet, and thing. The theme focuses on question. Meanwhile, the theme used in the target language the question that must be concepted in the mind. The target uses qualifier as expansion of the head </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pertanyaan</span><span class="font3"> ‘question’. From those themes, there is difference of modality embeds in each theme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Theme in the source language embeds proposition meaning since the theme focuses on question. The question is associated with idea which requires explanation using perception (Halliday, 2014). In the target clause, theme has proposal meaning since the qualifier states obligation realized with the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">harus</span><span class="font3"> ‘must’ as part of obligation. It is very clear that the clause gets sift in speech function.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The source language</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">The form of adoring </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">butha</span><span class="font3"> is with yadnya</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The theme found in the source language </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the form of adoring butha</span><span class="font3"> is nominal group complex. The head of the nominal group </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">form</span><span class="font3"> is elaborated with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of adoring butha</span><span class="font3">. The elaboration functions as qualifier in the nominal group complex. The theme in the target language is verbal group function as Subject realized with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">menyembah buta</span><span class="font3"> ‘worshiping </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">butha’.</span><span class="font3"> The theme of the source language focuses on the form or the way. In contrast, the theme found in the target language focuses on the process of doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">butha</span><span class="font3"> functioning as part of qualifier is not translated in the target language since the word embeds cultural aspect which can be found the appropriate word in the source language. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">butha</span><span class="font3"> gets shift from syntax point of view. It functions as part of Subject clause in the target language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From that explanation, the source and the target languages are so different in the emphasis, namely the source language focuses on nominal group complex and the target language focus on the verbal group. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">form</span><span class="font3"> functioning as head of thing is translated into </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">berwujud</span><span class="font3"> ‘form’ categorized as relational process in intensive (Halliday, 2014). The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> functioning as deictic definite cannot be found the translation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The aim of translation is to transfer the meaning by maintaining the equivalences from the source language into the target language. However, the translation occurring in the text get many sifts either in structure or semantic perspectives. The themes found in the source language get shifts which cause the translation is far from the equivalencies. The phenomena are caused by not only the lexes embedding with culture, but it is also caused by personal style of language in usage. Syntactically, the themes in the source language get shift for example from nominal group into relational process. The shifts are resulted from the different form of clause as message in the target language. Therefore, semantically, shifts also happen in the translation. The qualifiers used in the translation have important role to make deviation from the source and the target languages. The personal style in translating is the greatest factor leading to be far from equivalence which makes the readers/listeners have different interpretation.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The text uses many lexical terms associated with culture, the translator feels difficulty finding the appropriate lexes in the translation. To maintain the meaning or message, elaboration by giving elaboration or definition, are the best ways done in the target language. In addition, personal style in using language gives contribution which causes deviation from the source into the target languages. The result suggests that there are six clauses which get shift in clause as message. The seven themes get far from the equivalencies from the source into the target languages. The shifts do not only occur in syntax level, but it also happens in semantic level. The syntax shifts occur in the lexicogrammar stratum. The semantic shifts happen in the scope of meaning and speech function. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> functioning as deictic in the nominal group used as theme in the source language is not translated in the target language so the meaning of the translation conveyed through clauses cannot be as what the source text should be.</span></p>
