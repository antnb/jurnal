<p><span class="font3">Hydrologic cycle refers to the route of water cycle or the journey made by water on the earth’s surface. Water can change in form, and flows in various places before finally it gets back to the biggest source, that is, the ocean. Approximately 71% of the earth is covered with the ocean. Talking about the hydrologic cycle cannot be separated from talking about the sun and the ocean, that is, the impact of the rise and fall of the tides. In Veda, the traditional geography, in general, and in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tatwa</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Purana</span><span class="font3">, in particular, it is stated that the earth is divided into two parts; they are the main land and the ocean. The question is how deep the Hindu theology and philosophy about the hydrologic cycle is. The water on the earth’s surface evaporates, resulting from the hot ray radiated by the sun. In Reg. Veda Samhita.I.164.51, it is strongly stated that “the water on the earth’s surface rises due to evaporation”. After evaporation, water changes into water drops or fine dews referred to as clouds. There are many types and forms of clouds which may lead to storms; however, some have no impact. When such clouds are already formed, they are brought to every area of the earth’s surface. When they reach the saturation point, a natural phenomenon appears which is referred to as rain. The falling water makes the earth wet, fills up dams, flows along rivers, and fertilize every type of life on earth. Rain measures how the hydrologic cycle takes place. Therefore, it should be recognized that it is important to maintain the hydrologic 54</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">cycle, which determines that the earth’s fertility and prosperity will not be disturbed. The Hindu teaching is rich in such a philosophy referred to as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Hita Karana</span><span class="font3">. Even in very religious ritual water is always mainly used for purification. The sources of water such as wells, rivers, lakes, showers, and oceans are made to be physically and spiritually sacred. The concepts of balance and harmony are easily found in rituals and the philosophy of Veda, the holy book. Almost all the Hindu rituals and philosophies refer to the balanced and harmonious nature. The Hindu philosophy that it is important to protect water for all the creatures on the earth’s surface can guarantee the life sustainability. The life of every creature cannot be separated from water. If the hydrologic cycle which supports every life on earth is damaged, then the human life on earth will be damaged as well.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Scientifically, the hydrologic cycle, as one of the nature’s strengths, is a natural cycling process. However, metaphysically, it is a strength which comes from great Gods. In Hinduism, the oceans, the wind, the clouds, the rain, and even the mounts and rivers have their respective Gods. Many Vedic magic formulas which synergize with the natural facts have been found and revealed by the world’s philosophers. They are referred to as the scientific references used to overcome various aspects of human life on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The hydrologic cycle is highly closely related to the existence of the sun as the source of energy. The sun is the center of the solar system; it is surrounded by various outer space objects, earth is included. The sun is a huge ball which glows tremendously with a 1,400,000 kilometer diameter, meaning that its diameter is 100 times bigger than the earth’s diameter. Its mass is 333,420 times the earth’s mass, and its volume is 1,300,000 times the earth’s volume, meaning that its surface is 12,000 times wider than the earth’s volume (Adnyana, 2009: 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The water on the earth’s surface is made to evaporate by the hot ray radiated by the sun. The energy of the heat radiated by the sun causes the water in lakes, rivers, oceans, and even on leaves to evaporate vertically. The extended water crisis and the badly organized</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">environmental condition have caused the discourse of the local wisdom </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Hita Karana</span><span class="font3"> to appear again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The question to what extent the Hindu philosophy and theology contribute to the hydrologic cycle is raised to connect </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Hita Karana</span><span class="font3">, the Hydrological Cycle and Veda. The Hindu teaching highly appreciates the strength of the universe. It teaches people how to keep the nature in harmony. This is one of the ways of worshipping God and His manifestations. Gods are the holy shine of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Bhagavad-Gita, it is stated: “</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bahwa segelintir saja percikan dari Tuhan dapat menjaga dan menghidupi seluruh alam semesta beserta isinya</span><span class="font3">.” [What is done by God, how small it is, can protect and make the whole universe and what it contains alive]. It is the God’s shine in the forms of God which controls all His creations. The law of Gods operates through the law of the nature. Man appreciates it through rituals to keep the nature in harmony. This is one of the ways of worshipping the greatness of God who has created the nature. The Hindu teaching does not only teach to worship the ocean without any spirit; it does not teach to worship the sun without any spirit either; all cannot be separated from the God’s strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Appreciating the God’s strength through the blessing provided by Gods is the way in which the Hindu worshippers respect the nature as the God’s creation. Thus, there is an ethic education to protect the nature so that it will keep balanced and be in harmony. Therefore, respecting the natural strength and attempting to maintain the cycle balanced are two attempts made by the Hindu worshippers to glorify the holy shine of the God’s strength.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">various places; however, finally, it gets back to the biggest source, that is, the ocean. Approximately 71% of the earth’s surface is occupied by the ocean. In the traditional geography, it is stated that the earth is divided into two parts; they are the mainland and the ocean. The mainland is further divided into seven parts (referred to as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sapta Dwipa</span><span class="font3">); they are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jambu Dwipa, Plaksa Dwipa, Kusa Dwipa, Kraunca Dwipa</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Puskara Dwipa, Salmali Dwipa</span><span class="font3">, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Saka Dwipa</span><span class="font3">. The areas which are occupied by the ocean can be divided into seven parts; they are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lawana, Iksu, Sura, Sarpi, Dadhi</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dugdha</span><span class="font3">, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jala</span><span class="font3">. Among them, Lawana is the most special ocean. There are many other names for the ocean. In </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Purana, </span><span class="font3">Luwana is the Milk Ocean or referred to as Ksira (Adnyana, 2009: 27).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Waisnawa Tatwa, it is stated that water is the earliest beginning of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Purusauttama, who is well known as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Karanodakasayi Wishnu</span><span class="font3">, fills up everything with water. Then the term Karana Ocean (the causing ocean) appears. Millions of what is referred to as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Brahmanda</span><span class="font3"> (water bubbles) appears from His pores. In every </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Brahmanda</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Karanodakasayi Wishnu</span><span class="font3"> multiplies Himself and fills up what is popularly known as the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gharba Ocean</span><span class="font3">. His second aspect, that is, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Purusa</span><span class="font3">, he is referred to as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gharbodakasayi Wishnu</span><span class="font3">. After every Brahmanda is filled up again, He becomes Ksirodakasi Wishnu again, and it is this which occupies 71% of the earth’s surface (Adnyana, 2009: 77). Thus, water is the first and the most important thing in life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Winterniz, in his book entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A History of Indian Literature Volume I</span><span class="font3"> (1972), stated that the holy book Veda (Rg Veda) is the oldest monument and literary work in the world. If one wants to understand the beginning of the oldest culture, one should view Rg Veda as the oldest literary work which is still maintained. Bloomfield, in his book entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Religion of Veda</span><span class="font3"> (1908), stated that Rg Veda is not only the oldest monument but also the oldest document in the Eastern World. Furthermore, Svami Sivananda stated that Veda is the oldest book in the human library. The truth which every religion contains comes from Veda and refers back to Veda. It is the source of religious teachings; the highest source of all the religious literary works is Almighty God. Veda was revealed when the understanding of time became into existence. It contains the teachings which can give safety and direct what is done by man since when he is born to when he is dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In relation to the hydrologic cycle, in Rg Veda XII, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sukta</span><span class="font3"> 65, verse 2, it is explained that water functions to look after life.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tri Hita Karana</span><span class="font3"> means the three things which contribute to prosperity, resulting from the harmonious relationship between man and God, man and his environmental nature, and man and his fellow beings. In its implementation, it is the basic foundation of the existence of the traditional villages in Bali which needs to be conserved by everybody. In the life of the Hindu worshippers in Bali, it is implemented in the forms of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">parhyangan</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">palemahan</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pawongan</span><span class="font3"> through rituals referred to as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">yadnya</span><span class="font3">. The relationship between man and God is implemented by performing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dewa Yadnya</span><span class="font3">; the relationship between man and his environment is implemented by performing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bhuta Yadnya</span><span class="font3">, and the relationship between man and his fellow beings is implemented by performing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Manusa Yadnya</span><span class="font3"> (Ngurah, 1999: 99). The existences of Segara Temple, Masceti Temple, Ulun Suwi Temple, and Ulun Danu Temple at Bedugul exemplify the implementation of Tri Hita Karana in the Balinese people’s daily life. They are the temples where the farmers and fishermen go to worship God. They also indicate that the areas where they are located are the agricultural areas.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">refuted by a scientist named Galileo-galilei (1564-1642). According to him, the sun does not go around the earth; and that it is the earth which goes around the sun. He was the first scientist who could see the moon’s craters through his telescope. What was stated by Galileo is in line with what is explained in Veda as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Aayam gauh prsnir akramidasadan, Maataram purah, pitaram ca prayantsvah</span><span class="font3">”, meaning “Earth rotates in the outer space with springs in its orbit. It moves around its father, that is, the sun”. (Yayur Veda Samhita. I.III.6).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What was stated by Galileo is in line with what is stated in the Vedic magic formula as follows: “Ia bergerak mengelilingi ayahnya” (it moves around its father) means that the earth goes around the sun as the center of the solar system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Furthermore, Johanes Kepler, a modern scientist (1571-1819) stated that earth went around the sun. He stated that all the outer space objects went around the sun. Even in his theory, it was stated that every planet went around the sun, following the oval orbiting line. However, their speeds vary; the closer a planet to the sun, the higher its speed will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore, it is not surprising if a great philosopher named </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kanayalal Manghandas Talreja</span><span class="font3"> (2005: 161) stated that Veda, despite the oldest holy book, is highly in line with the modern knowledge. As the source of the energy of heat, the sun is a huge ball which flares up and glows. The sun has the spectrum which allows experts to identity its elements. Such a spectrum is made up of seven types of colors; they are red, bright red, yellow, green, blue, blue dye, and purple. What is stated in Veda is as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Such magic formula “Yang bersinar sendiri (what gleams by itself)” refers to the sun.

<p><span class="font3">In Veda how the sun functions as the source of life is explained. The sun in the morning is highly good for the bone health (vitamin D). It seems that such an explanation makes everybody cool, and gives emission of energy which is good for both physical and mental health. The weather is fresh when we face the direction where the sun rises. It is at this time when it is very good to perform what is referred to as the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Surya Namaskara </span><span class="font3">movement. It is a very good movement for health, and, at the same time, it is also a movement when to respect </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bhatara Surya</span><span class="font3"> (the sun). If we practice such a movement accurately and regularly with a strong belief, healthy will certainly side with us. Scientifically, the Vedic truth should be acknowledged, and that is enough to prove that Veda is the God’s word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The sun is the greatest energy of heat; therefore, the ocean, as the greatest water source, is closely related to the sun. In the hydrologic cycle, it is also identified that the sea water evaporates most. Most water on the earth’s surface such as the water in lakes, rivers and even on the surface of leaves evaporate. Furthermore, it is stated in Yajur Veda Samhita that :</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“Disucikan oleh sinar matahari yang bersih dan tiada cacat, sebagaimana halnya air yang bagus dan indah yang mengalir menuju samudra, naik ke atyas menuju angkasa, and memelihara tanaman obat, dimumikan oleh sinar-sinar matahari itu.” Yajur Veda Samhita I.12).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After it evaporates, it condenses and clouds are formed. Such clouds get together and when it reaches the freezing point, it falls in the form of rain. If the rain directly falls into the sea, then the short cycle will take place. Then it evaporates again, forms clouds and falls in the form of rain again into the sea. The next cycle is the medium one. In this case, the journey made by water is long enough. The clouds it forms are brought by the wind to the land in the earth’s surface. When they reach mountains, they are detained by forests, and when they reach the freezing point, they fall in the form of rain. The explanation is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Clouds are made to be wet by forests, occupy spacious space and obtain water from the air” (Yajur Veda Sahita I.14).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A lesson which should be well paid attention to is that, as human beings, we should conserve the forest which detains the clouds. If the forest is chopped down and damaged, then the hydrologic cycle will be disturbed and endanger the nature and the creatures on its surface. Therefore, we should learn how to look after the forest to keep the nature conserved. If the forest is left to be denuded, the hydrologic cycle will not take place as it should. The reason is that the more the trees in the forest are felled, the scarcer the rain will be.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In the long hydrologic cycle, the clouds which are formed are brought to the mountains by the wind and finally reach the peak when the temperature is very cold. When they reach the saturation point, they fall in the form of rain and even ice in the mountains. Gradually as time passes, the ice in the mountains melts and flows along the rivers and empty into the sea. Much is absorbed by the land. This is what is referred to as the long cycle. The area when the clouds go is referred to as the plateau, and in Veda it is explained in the magic formula as follows: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Upahvaresu yad aciddhyam yayim Vaya iva marutah kena cit pathaa Scotanti kosaa upa vo rathesvaa Ghrtam uksataa madhuvarnam arcate,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">meaning that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hi</span><span class="font3"> the vital principle, if you pile the moving clouds on or close to a mountainous slope, then they will fly to different directions as birds do, where they will change into the rain which is saved in Your Cart. It is hoped that you will expel what is sweet, that is, drops of honey around You”. (Reg Veda Samhita.I.87.2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is such a cycle which the water on the earth’s surface undergoes. It should be recognized that how important it is for us to do what we can do to maintain such a cycle as it contributes to the fertility and prosperity on the earth’s surface; in other words, such a cycle will keep the fertility and prosperity on the earth’s surface not disturbed. If human beings are aware that this should be understood, water will become a very important thing.

<p><span class="font3">medium. The water sources such as wells, rivers, lakes, showers, and even oceans are physically and spiritually purified. Therefore, understanding such a hydrologic cycle means that we should be aware that it is very important to look after the water on the earth’s surface. The reason is that it is the water which can make everything alive. There will be no life without water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The most outstanding objective of every ritual which is performed by the Hindus is to make the macrocosmos and microcosmos (the universe and ourselves) in harmony. What can be found in the microcosmos can also be found in the macrocosmos. Simply, it can be stated that our bodies are made up of five elements which come from the universe; they are soil, water, air, fire, ether, and earth; they all form our bodies. Therefore, our bodies are closely related to the nature around us. If the universe around us seriously changes or are seriously disturbed by pollution then automatically our bodies will change as well. Therefore, the Hindu worshippers always do their best to keep the nature balanced. In the Hindu teaching the hydrologic cycle is used as the strong foundation of the holy book. It is implemented through rituals which are performed to keep such a cycle balanced. If such a concept of being balanced is philosophically observed, then we can see that water flows through rivers from mountains. Mounts and forests should be well looked after to keep the water flowing through rivers balanced. If mounts and forests are degraded, then the water flowing through rivers will lead to disasters. If forests are degraded, floods cannot be</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">avoided from taking place and will affect the mainland as all types of dirt will go the ocean.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In this case, the Hindu concept is multiple. On one hand, the respect for the nature is addressed to the power which controls the nature itself, that is, Almighty God through His holy rays, namely, great Gods; on the other hand, it is an attempt to respect the nature, as, if it is respected, it will indirectly urge that human beings should keep it balanced, and, if it is balanced, it will be useful to the human life. The positions of man, the nature and God should be in harmony, as if they are in harmony all creatures will be safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Similarly, there is also such a relationship between the sun and the sea water; the sun causes the sea water to rise and fall. In this case, the earth’s satellite, that is, the moon also plays an important role. The sun causes the sea water to rise and fall, and the moon has the strength which can draw the earth. When the sun and moon are in the same line as the earth, the drawing between the sun and the moon causes the sea water to rise dramatically. This is explained in Veda as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Pencipta segala object yang tergantung di angkasa dan daya bawaan di dalam matahari untuk menggerakan air”. (Yajur Veda Samhita.IV.36)” [The creator of every outer space object and the sun’s water moving capability”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words “</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Daya bawaan di dalam matahari</span><span class="font3"> (the sun’s water moving capability)” in the Vedic magic formula above means that the sun is capable of causing the sea water to rise. Such information above is in line with the scientific fact. That indicates that the sun cannot be separated from the ocean. In several cases, the controllers of the two strengths are closely related. The sun ‘Surya’ and the ocean ‘Waruna’ are always side by side in several</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">aspects of the Vedic literature. In Bhagavad-Gita, it is stated that the ocean is the biggest and most important source of water:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sarasam asmi saagarah</span><span class="font3">”, meaning that among the water sources, I am the ocean (Bhagavad-Gita.10.24).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the biggest water source is the ocean, all the water on the earth’s surface goes to and comes from the ocean. The rain that falls to the earth’s surface stagnates on the mainland and valleys in such a way that they form lakes, and flows through rivers. The short, medium and long cycles of water come to an end in the ocean. The ocean is controlled by Lord Waruna, meaning spreading out. It can be imagined that the ocean is so wide that it covers most parts of the earth. Its strength is so great that man becomes meaningless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Purana, it can be identified that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Purusa</span><span class="font3"> (God), as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Karanodakasayi Wishnu</span><span class="font3">, lies down on the causing ocean (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">karana</span><span class="font3">), and water bubbles referred to as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Brahmanda</span><span class="font3"> appear from His pores.

It is the embryo of life which keeps developing. Therefore, the ocean is also referred to as the greatest source of water which is so extraordinarily strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lord Waruna is a great god which controls the so great strength of the ocean. In addition, He is also the lord of all types of water and its creatures. In several holy books, Lord Waruna is better known as Bhatara Sagara. There is a myth in which it is told that gods and giants construct a great project and mix the ocean referred to as Lawana.

He is a great lord; all gods and giants worship Him, indicating that He is an extraordinarily Lord, as stated in the following sentence:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">From the above description it can be identified that Lord Samudra is merciful. He does not mind blessing his worshippers. However, what is always emphasized by Lord Waruna is that everything should refer to the prevailing law. Lord Waruna is one of the gods who always maintains the nature’s work law. Although he is highly merciful, he will not be so merciful if His worshippers do not do their best to work based on the work ethic. Lord Waruna is one of the gods who always gives priority to the work ethic and the fixed nature’s law.

<p><span class="font3">That warns human beings in general and those who are lazy in particular that the gods should also work hard and cannot avoid the law which has been stipulated. It is what has been done by the gods which should be exemplified by human beings that nothing is possible without work. In many literary books, Lord Waruna always shows an eternal law. He always presents the consequence of the nature’s law which cannot be changed. As the god who controls water, Lord Waruna is always merciful and gives welfare. He is a great god who always stands before the worshippers who intend to purify themselves or the objects which can be found in water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on such a myth, the sea is certainly one of the good and great places where people can purify themselves in both large and small scales.

<p><span class="font3">Based on what was discussed above and referring to the theories which have been proved and examined to be true, it can be concluded that the hydrological cycle is the journey made by the water on the earth’s surface.

<p><span class="font3">The evaporation resulting from the sun’s heat energy causes water to change its form. The water which evaporates in different areas changes into clouds. In other words, the clouds are formed by the rising mass of the weather before they condense to form the gentle dews which fly in the atmosphere. It is possible that the clouds will become dangerous storms which are pitch black in color. They are dangerous as they often lead to a thunderstorm or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cumulonimbus</span><span class="font3"> (Cb). The clouds which look soft and highly bright are referred to as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cirrus</span><span class="font3"> (Cr). When they are formed, they are flown to different parts of the world, and when they reach saturation point, a natural phenomenon falls and it is this which is referred to as rain. It makes the earth wet, fills up dams, flows through rivers, and fertilizes every type of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The hydrologic cycle can be classified into three; they are the short cycle, the medium cycle, and the long cycle. Each model indicates how long or how fast the cycle takes place on the earth’s surface until it reaches the greatest source, that is, the ocean. Essentially, rain can be used to measure the classifications of the hydrological cycle, and all the processes are controlled by the sun. It is the sun which plays the most important role in controlling life and causing everything on the earth’s surface to be alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus, the theories proposed by the modern scientists and the Vedic clauses as to the hydrological cycle have become a synergism, meaning that the opinion of the modern scientists that the hydrological cycle can affect the nature’s condition is identical with what is stated in the Vedic clauses. The relationship among the three should be in harmony to 72</span></p>
