<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Tourism is still believed to increase business opportunity with the downward trend in Covid-19 cases. People can not wait to have their holiday to refresh their body, mind and soul, have spiritual balance and relaxation experiences. Spa industry which is part of the wellness tourism are growing rapidly in Bali. Wellness tourism has become a travel trend in recent years and is becoming an emerging market segment in some countries (Bushell and Sheldon, 2009). While medical tourists seek solely treatments for medical purposes, wellness tourism is assumed to be pursued by healthy people who care much about their health and seek physical fitness or improvement, spiritual balance, and cultural as well as relaxation experiences (Capellini, 2010). Wellness tourism is a niche market segment within the global travel and tourism industry and offers countless opportunities in product development and the future markets. Indonesia is a potential market for domestic and international wellness tourists (</span><a href="https://globalwellnessinsti-tute.org/industry-research/wellness"><span class="font2">https://globalwellnessinsti-tute.org/industry-research/wellness</span></a><span class="font2">).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While there are many cities and across the world offer wellness tourism, some tend to be more popular than others. Soedibyo (2009) stated that the number of spas in Bali is 600 spas, while in Indonesia it is estimated that there are around 1000 spas. On the other hand, spa which offer high technology, equipment and services are available in Bali. Paris which is one of the world's best destinations, has Thalasso Spa theraphy which is a therapy that is carried out using ingredients derived from the sea such as sea water itself, algae, seaweed, sand and sea mud. Thalasso therapy is also increasingly recognized, both as a beauty and health treatment. To improve competitiveness of spa tourism in Bali, efforts need to be undertaken. This study aimed to: i) to analyze characteristics of spa’ customer in Bali, ii) to identify products and services </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot"><span class="font1">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></a><span class="font1">185</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Type of Spa Treatment Preferred by Consumer</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The results showed that among 38 spas in Bali, traditional spa treatment reach the highest percentage preferred by consumer. It was about 35 %, followed by reflexology treatment 18 %, hot stone treatment 18 %, hot oil treatment 7 % and aromatherapy treatment and ayurveda 2% respectively. It can be seen in the Figure 2. This figure indicated that traditional spa treatment has the highest competitiveness in Bali that must be well managed to improve Balinese economy. Reflexology, hot stone, and hot oil treatment were also a good market for spa treatment in Bali. It can be understood that visitors enjoy wellness tourism to improve their body and mind while travelling in a long distance.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/108773-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:204pt;height:114pt;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Figure 2. </span><span class="font2">Type of spa treatment preferred by customer</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Type of Spa Products</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Agricultural products were the most popular spa product preferred by consumer. It was about 47.96% among 38 spas in Bali offered agricultural spa products, followed by imported lotion 10.41% and spa product from the sea 8.33%. The results also showed that 33.3% of spa in Bali offered mix products i.e. agricultural products, spa product from the sea as well as imported lotion. Variety of consumer’s need and want was the reason that spa in Bali offered variety of products as well to fulfil consumer needs. It can be seen in the Figure 3.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/108773-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:205pt;height:107pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Spa Ownership</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Regarding spa ownership, the results showed that among 38 spas in Bali about 46.1% owned by Balinese. In contrast, 30.8% owned by non-Balinese and about 23.1% owned by foreigner. It can be seen in the Figure 4. The results showed worrying figure, because if the spa ownerships are not Balinese, meaning that the benefit economy of spa industry will going out to outside of Bali that will impacts in tourism leakage. As studies by Suryawardani (2014), Suryawardani et.al., (2016); Sury-awardani and Wiranatha (2016) found that tourism leakage happens when benefit of tourism going out to the outside of Balinese economy. This means that development of spa tourism will not be beneficial for Balinese community. Most of the benefit will leaks out to the outside of Bali. Efforts to strengthen local ownership of spa is crucial.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/108773-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:206pt;height:120pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Spa Management in Bali</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Regarding the spa management in Bali, the results showed that among 38 spas, the highest percentage of spa management was managed by Balinese, about</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">78.38%, followed by non-Balinese about 18.92% and 2.7% of spa in Bali managed by foreigner. It can be seen in the Figure 5. The results also showed worrying figure. Even though the highest percentage of spa managed by Balinese, the role of non-Bali-nese and foreigner in managing spa in Bali showed a challenge by spa industry in Bali. Efforts in strengthen the role of local community is crucial.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/108773-5.jpg" alt="" style="width:212pt;height:107pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Spa Therapist</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Based on the spa therapist, the results showed that Balinese people play the highest role as spa therapist. It was about 65.8%, followed by non-Balinese 2.62 %, and mix figure between Balinese and nonBalinese, about 31.58%. It can be seen in the Figure 6. This is a good figure, meaning that the spa industry in Bali absorbs labor for the people of Bali</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/108773-6.jpg" alt="" style="width:211pt;height:115pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Products and services provided by traditional and Thalasso spa in Bali</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The results show that traditional spa treatments in Bali provide variety of products such as scrub, cream and lotion from herbs and natural ingredients from agriculture. Type of services available are</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">traditional massage, aromatherapy, Thai massage, reflexology, hot stone massage and hot oil massage. The results also show that traditional massage is still preferred by customers. Price competitiveness is one of the reasons why people choose traditional spa. Sense of traditional massage has also been preferred by customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thalasso Bali Spa is the only Thal-asso Spa treatment in Bali situated at the Grand Mirage Bali Resort since 1985 which offering a wide range of spa treatments to provide the relaxation and rejuvenation of the body and soul. Featuring an aqua medic pool with heated seaweed and sea water with 16 uniquely designed treatment rooms. Excellent services were also found in this type of spa treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These results indicated that even though traditional spa is preferred by spa customer, however, hospitality and services must be improved to gain customer’ satisfaction. Customer’ satisfaction is the important component in all businesses. Some studies regarding visitors’ satisfaction have been found as follow: Purnami and Suryawardani (2018) found that satisfaction significantly contributed to their desire to pay a revisit. In addition, Antonietta, et al., (2020) found that marketing mix and service quality had a significant effect on tourist satisfaction, and tourist satisfaction had a significant effect on revisit intention. Moreover, Hidayana, et al. (2019) found that visitors’ motivation had significant effect on tourist satisfaction. Participation of local communities must also be improved. Diversity of attraction which provide unique and innovative cultural products must be maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The role of local wisdom as the main attention for tourists to visit Prai Ijing Traditional Village need to be maintained. Other study on service quality and satisfaction undertaken by Triyanti, et. al (2021) on </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font2">ervice Quality, Brand Attributes, Satisfaction and Loyalty of Guests Staying at Le Meridien Hotel Bali Jimbaran found that quality of service had a significant effect on satisfaction and satisfaction has a</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">significant effect on loyalty. Suggestions that can be made in this study that hotel should support loyalty, maintain, and pay close attention to brand attributes that need to be improved and guest mindset influence, as well as the should nd other aspects that can support and increase guest loyalty. Understanding visitors’ preferences are also important component in visitors’ behavior, such as a study by Dheanita, et. al (2022) found that tourists' preference i.e., cleanliness, price, attractiveness, service, recommendations, security, and promotion were the relative importance attribute during pandemic period in Bali. So that, research on customer’ satisfaction and loyalty as well as customer’ preferences on the spa industry need to be undertaken to fulfil customers’ need and wants. This study will give more information regarding supply and demand analysis of the spa industry in Bali.</span></p>
