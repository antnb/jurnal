<p><span class="font2">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a disease that is growing and becoming a global health problem. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of perceived social norm on fear of stigma among adolescents with HIV in Palembang City. This research used a case study research design. The research sample was 6 key informants who had been infected with HIV as many as 4 MSM adolescents and 2 FSW with an age range of 15-24 years in Palembang. In addition, researchers also explored information through key expert informants, including from the Palembang City Health Office, HIV/AIDS program implementers at health care facilities, and Sriwijaya Plus Foundation. This research used qualitative-descriptive methods and data were analyzed using content analysis techniques. The results showed that people's views of people with HIV are still quite negative. Society perceived people with HIV as disgusting, sinful, dishonorable, terminally ill, and infected by virtue of their karma. This view has resulted in stigma, misunderstanding, rejection and discrimination. As a result, people are afraid that their HIV status will be known to family loved ones, and the community. Therefore, social support, especially from family and close people, is needed to support the survival of people living with HIV. In addition, the role of health workers in educating the public about HIV is needed to eliminate poor stereotypes and behaviors of the community towards people living with HIV.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a disease that is on the rise and is a global health problem. Based on data from World Health Organization (WHO) at the end of 2021, there were 1.5 million people infected HIV as 650.000 people die because HIV and an estimated were around 38.4 million people living with HIV worldwide. HIV occurs due to HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) infecting and damaging the structure of white blood cells, resulting in a decrease in the human immune system<sup>1</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Indonesia, HIV incidence has been increasing year by year. In 2022, the incidence of HIV has reached 10.525 cases from 941.973 people tested for HIV<sup>2</sup>. The latest data from the Ministry of Health shows that HIV cases in Indonesia are starting to be dominated by young people, accounting for about 51% of cases. According to Indonesian Pediatric Association, therefore, 1.188 HIVpositive children in Indonesia by age group 15-19 years most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS infection in 2022. Furthermore, the Central Static’s Agency of South Sumatra reported 639 cases of HIV in 2022, with Palembang having the highest number of cases, totaling 353. This information highlights the concerning fact that HIV not only affects adults, but also children and adolescents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Adolescence is a period of physical, psychological, and intellectual development and growth. While this development does not always result in positive outcomes, it also exposes adolescents to negative influences and may lead to promiscuity due to their high curiosity in various ways<sup>3</sup>. The occurrence of promiscuity in adolescents may result from several factors including inadequate parental supervision, low self-efficacy, and lack of adolescent awareness, disharmonious family condition, economic conditions, or adverse living environment. Moreover, adolescents may lack maturity, leading to wrong decisions and unawareness of the consequences of their actions<sup>4</sup></span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Behaviors or attitudes that mistreat and underestimate people with HIV are associated with high HIV incidence<sup>5</sup>. This creates problems of human rights violations for people living with HIV and their families<sup>6</sup>. As a result, people living with HIV often feel insecure because they are seen as having infectious diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a matter of fact, the behavior shown by the community is influenced by the religion that the local community has adopted. Pregnancies outside of wedlock and engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners within some religious doctrines are deemed as sins. Moreover, there exists as assumption that people living with HIV are the consequence of transgressions of norms and karma<sup>7</sup>. This stereotype involves judging individuals who</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">are not accepted within social circles. Prior research indicates that a majority of Indonesian people adhere to collectivism, which encompasses ideologies, norms, and sociocultural values that align closely with societal attitudes and behaviors<sup>8.</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Societal attitudes contribute to discrimination against those with HIV causing them to fear disclosing their status. This fear can lead to negative feelings of helplessness, inadequacy, failure, unpopularity, and a loss of morale. Consequently, HIV sufferers may give up easily and resort to blaming themselves or others<sup>9</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Noncompliance, refusal of Anti-Retro Virus (ARV) treatment, and suicidal ideation are potential negative outcomes. This study aims to determine the influence of perceived social norm on fear of stigma among adolescents with HIV in Palembang City</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>DISCUSSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The negative attitudes and views of society towards people living with HIV cannot be disconnected from the societal stereotype that associates HIV disease with negativity. This assumption has been ingrained for so long that it is intricately connected with social issues that give rise to stigma in society. Stigma persists due to ignorance about HIV-related matters. Unfair attitudes and perceptions towards people living with HIV are often influenced by a lack of knowledge or information regarding the transmission of the virus<sup>10</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Stigma plays a significant role in society's existing order and norms, leading to discrimination and human rights violations against people living with HIV (PLHIV)<sup>11</sup>. Discrimination against PLHIV takes various forms, such as negative attitudes, unfair treatment, avoidance, blame, workplace exclusion, verbal or nonverbal abuse, and rejection by their families or social circle, resulting in reluctance to be accepted in groups<sup>12</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Public misconceptions about HIV can lead to discrimination and rejection that causes people living with HIV (PLHIV) to feel fearful if others, including their loved ones, become aware of their status. Additionally, PLHIV may experience anxiety about the potential impact of HIV. This fear is based on community beliefs that HIV infection is a result of deviant behavior and actions that do not align with societal norms<sup>5</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus, the views and behaviors of people have a variety of physical, social, and psychological effects on people living with HIV.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical impact</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The physical impact experienced by people living with HIV includes weight loss, changes in appearance, skin disorders, and fatigue. This results form the burden that must be carried by the affected person. This burden </span><a href="http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eum"><span class="font0">http://ojs.unud.ac.id/index.php/eum</span></a><span class="font0"> doi:10.24843.MU.2024.V13.i01.P13</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">encompasses the courses of the disease, the development of secondary infections and stress triggered by uncertain healing processes<sup>13</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The physical impact felt by people with HIV is in the form of weight loss, changes in appearance, skin disorders and fatigue. This is due to the burden that the person has to carry. The burden includes the course of the disease, the emergence of secondary infections, stress due to uncertain healing processes, and anxiety.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Impact</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The social impact of HIV felt by people living with HIV is stigma, discrimination, ostracism and acts of violence against people living with HIV. The social impact that occurs due to the stigma that exists in society. In addition, the social impact that occurs in the form of social problems in the face of negative views and treatment by society, including people around them who have previously tended to be discriminatory, such as not caring, suspicious, viewed negatively, shunned and ostracized<sup>9</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is supported by the findings of previous studies that the majority of people closest to the patient do not know the patient's HIV status. People with HIV state that those around them are not worried or sad, are not discriminated against, and are not ostracized by their family or community<sup>14</sup>.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychological Impact</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Based on this, individuals suffering from HIV who perceive themselves near death face a psychological impact, leading to the loss of self-confidence, increased anxiety, and changes in self-concept. Furthermore, societal negative views can affect the health of HIV-positive individuals, manifesting in the form of negative self-conception whereby they perceive themselves as weak and likely to give up easily<sup>9</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a result, self-concept refers to an individual's entire self-image, which encompasses their perceptions, beliefs, and values. This concept can be divided into two categories: positive self-concept and negative self-concept..</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Positive self-concept involves the capacity to accept life's circumstances and remain objective, realistic, and unemotional. Negative self-concept, on the other hand, entails the inconsistent assumptions about oneself. This leads individuals to lack certainty when it comes to their abilities, weaknesses, and values, resulting in self-isolation, suicidal ideation or self-harm, and feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness<sup>15</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition, the psychological impact on people living with HIV is hughly stressful during development<sup>16.</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Research suggests that HIV patients often experience fear of the virus spreading, as well as fear of their friends, colleagues, and parents knowing their status, resulting in rejection. These patients may also experience anxiety about their future and the possibility of death..</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Therefore, community-provided social support is crucial for the survival of individuals living with HIV, especially from those closest to them. Social support entails</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">offering comfort, a sense of self-worth, attention, and assistance. Consequently, individuals living with HIV will feel valued, accepted, and free from discrimination in society with the provision of social support<sup>15</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Social support can also relieve anxiety and stress in people with HIV, which will ultimately have an impact on better survival of sufferers. In this case, the role of health workers is needed to overcome negative views and community behaviors that have been experienced by people with HIV<sup>17</sup>. This role involves providing education and disseminating information to community leaders and the wider community in a manner that is accurate and appropriate with regard to HIV<sup>18</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not only is support from healthcare professionals crucial, but social support from family and loved ones for HIV sufferers is also necessary to suppress the spread of the infection. Previous research suggests that family support has a significant impact on the quality of life of people with HIV<sup>19</sup>. In the final analysis, social support is closely linked to the well-being of people living with HIV<sup>20</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The presence of social support may impact a patient's ability to cope with their illness. Another aspect of social support for individuals with HIV is their adherence to taking antiretroviral medications (ARVs). Theoretically, familial support may have an impact on an individual's attitude and behavior, particularly those with specific medical conditions<sup>17</sup>.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The results of the study state that people views HIV sufferers as someone who is disgusting and sinful, a disgrace to the family or environment, has a deadly disease, and they are viewed infected as a result of the actions they take. This assumption gives rise to stigma which ultimately leads to misunderstanding, rejection, and even discrimination against HIV sufferers. It is the reason why HIV sufferers are afraid that their status as HIV patients will be known by their family, those closest to them and the community. Therefore, as a result, sufferers feel sad, afraid, want to be angry with themselves, and even isolate themselves from society. Thus social support is needed from family and those closest to them in order to support the survival of HIV sufferers. In addition, health workers should participate in educating the wider community regarding HIV in order to eliminate public perceptions and bad behavior towards HIV sufferers.</span></p>
