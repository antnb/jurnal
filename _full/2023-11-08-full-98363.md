<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ABSTRACT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This research was conducted with the aim of analyzing the green economy transition in tourism, especially tourist villages, whether it is able to provide inspiration or actually prevent an increase in people's income in conditions of the COVID-19 shock. The research was carried out in tourist villages in West Java and Lampung Provinces. This study found thatthe transition of a tourist village with the concept of green economy has a strong influence in increasing the income of rural tourism communities in conditions of the COVID-19 shock, this is due to the fact that the green economy concept encourages the utilization of natural resources and environmental preservation, this will ensure a sustainable attraction for tourists which in turn can increase revenue.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The COVID-19 epidemic affects many facets of international society. The World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified it as a global emergency at the end of January 2020. The fallout has profound effects on the worldwide economy (Patel, 2020). This is shown by the fact that the tourist industry is forced to shut down. One industry that took a major damage is the tourist industry. Once buoyant, the tourist industry has seen recent decline as the continuing epidemic dampens early expansion (Škare, Soriano, &amp;&nbsp;Porada-Rochoń, 2021). Foreign visitors have declined along with the fall in international flights, while domestic tourists have decreased and may reduce more due to many government measures (Abbas, Mubeen, Iorember, Raza, &amp;&nbsp;Mamirkulova, 2021). Indonesia's tourist industry has ground to a halt due to government rules meant to curb the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus. How long this will last is anyone's guess (Uğur &amp;&nbsp;Akbıyık, 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Several sectors connected to tourism have been affected by the temporary halt in activity. Huge losses have been incurred by Indonesia's tourism industry across the board as a consequence of the decreased number of visitors brought about by different government regulations surrounding social restrictions. It also affects the long-term viability of the tourism industry, particularly in resort communities (Aldao, Blasco, &amp;&nbsp;Poch Espallargas, 2022). A tourist village is a rural location that offers something very special for visitors interested in</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">experiencing local culture, history, and everyday life. Community-based and environmentally-friendly tourist development, like that practiced in tourism villages, necessitates the creation of gender-responsive development policies (Susilorini et al., 2022). As a result of the pandemic's spread, several hotels and other tourism-related businesses have had to shut their doors. However, the loss of the village's major source of income has been one of the most devastating effects on the tourist town. Many popular tourist locations have closed during the ongoing epidemic, making it imperative that tourist communities be well-managed (Judge, 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Rural Tourism Village has several potential draws because to its unique setting. The village is a resource with untapped potential for economic growth and social well-being that must be developed further (Susilo, Hidayat, &amp;&nbsp;Marta, 2021). But on the other hand, the results of the study (Laili Dwi Agustina, Annastya Putri Kirana, 2022) concluded that the government's efforts to boost the tourist industry's economy continue to over-exploit natural resources. With this phenomenon, the management of tourist villages with the concept of green economy is very important, because it can preserve nature and the surrounding ecosystem. Efforts to put into practice a kind of development that prioritizes the health of the planet's ecosystems and the preservation of its natural resources might find fertile ground in the green economy idea. In this sense, tourist towns have a vested interest in making a profit, but they also have a responsibility to protect the local environment so as to foster harmony between people and their natural surroundings (Shang, Qi, Chen, Yang, &amp;&nbsp;Chen, 2022). It is hoped that the Green Economy idea would provide a solution, serving as a link between rising living standards, fair treatment of all citizens, and conservation of natural resources. It is important to consider the possible tradeoffs and synergies between the economic and environmental elements of the Green Economy concept, which is presented by many organisations as a vehicle for sustainable resource management (without neglecting social issues) (Vu, Nguyen, Nguyen, &amp;&nbsp;Tran, 2022).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In study (Nur, Maulana, Nashihah, &amp;&nbsp;Wardah, 2022) As a tourism model that should be the best at conserving natural resources, ecotourism which takes into account environmental concerns, displays respect for parts of nature, exhibits an attitude of concern for environmental sustainability. In research studies (Pol &amp;&nbsp;Rutkowska, 2023) When it comes to defining green economy, striking a middle ground between minimizing ecological and environmental risks and maximizing social and economic well-being for all people is crucial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Previous research, both domestically and abroad, has resulted in findings and identification there is a gap that in tourism development there is still exploitation of the environment so this research will further discuss the findings of the existing phenomenon where the green economy concept provides opportunities for community welfare with environmental balance in tourism areas, especially tourist villages. However, there is another contradiction that during the current COVID-19 era, tourism has decreased drastically so that people's income from the tourism business has gone bankrupt. This research was conducted with the aim of analyzing the green economy transition in tourism, especially tourist villages, whether it is able to provide inspiration or actually prevent an increase in people's income in conditions of the COVID-19 shock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This research needs to be done because tourism villages and nature-based tourism have the potential to be part of the solution in building local economic resilience. By making the transition to a green economy, which focuses more on sustainability and environmental preservation. Transitioning to a green economy in the context of tourism can help reduce negative impacts on the environment and natural resources. This is an important step to ensure that the natural tourist attraction remains sustainable for future generations. Through a green</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">economy approach, local communities can be more involved in decision-making and resource management in their own areas. This can increase community involvement in the development and management of tourist villages, as well as help reduce social inequality. By involving these various aspects in research on the green economy transition to rural tourism, it can help develop recommendations and guidelines for building sustainable tourism villages, reducing negative impacts, and providing real benefits to local communities in the post-COVID-19 era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to Midgley's (1997) welfare theory, a society's standard of living improves when its numerous issues are solved, its people's wants are met, and their possibilities are expanded (Arbulú, Razumova, Rey-Maquieira, &amp;&nbsp;Sastre, 2021). The concept of well-being makes individuals have the desire to fulfill their desires and needs. There is a tendency for individuals to always try to satisfy that desire. With the tendency of individuals to always try to satisfy their desires, welfare will be achieved when satisfaction reaches an optimum level (Joo, Xu, Lee, Lee, &amp;&nbsp;Woosnam, 2021). The creation of a prosperous living condition when humans can meet their needs, social problems can be resolved properly and humans have social opportunities to work, get an education, get health services and participate in development (Acosta, Maharjan, Peyriere, &amp;&nbsp;Mamiit, 2020). The importance of welfare theory in this research is based on the fact that, in an effort to better the human condition, social welfare seeks to harmonize with a wide range of disciplinary relationships, including those with the environment (through ideas like ecotourism and green economy), in order to create a model of growth that ensures prosperity without compromising the quality of life for future generations (Adnyana, Primasari, &amp;&nbsp;Yulianah, 2020).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Temporary travel from one location to another, done alone or in groups, with the goals of social peace, cultural immersion, and natural and scientific discovery is what we call tourism (Adnyana et al., 2020). As a human endeavor, tourism is described as the intentional pursuit of leisurely travel for the purpose of receiving services from a variety of providers in locations both inside and outside of one's own nation. acquire a regular job (Pham, Dwyer, Su, &amp;&nbsp;Ngo, 2021). Traveling for the sake of recreation, leisure, enjoyment, discovery, education, health promotion, recreation, relaxation, business, or any other personal or professional goal is known as tourism. Tourism, in its broadest sense, is transient movement from one location to another by a person or a group with the purpose of exploring, learning about, and perhaps improving upon one's social, cultural, natural, and scientific surroundings (Sharma, Thomas, &amp;&nbsp;Paul, 2021). To qualify as a vacation, a journey must be brief, undertaken without any feeling of obligation or compulsion, and not include any kind of gainful employment (Butchers, 2021). The term tourism refers to a broad category of trips taken by individuals, families, and large groups from their home location to other locations across the world for the express purpose of sightseeing rather than working or residing there. This is just a stopover on a longer journey back to its permanent home (Duro, Perez-Laborda, Turrion-Prats, &amp;&nbsp;Fernández-Fernández, 2021).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The COVID-19 pandemic has had a broad impact on the world tourism industry due to reduced demand from domestic and foreign tourists. The pressure on the tourism industry was evident in the massive drop in international tourist arrivals with massive cancellations and reduced bookings (Zenker &amp;&nbsp;Kock, 2020). The government's social restriction policy, which led to the temporary closure of tourist attractions in an effort to stem the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, also led to a significant drop in tourist traffic and, consequently, local revenue (Z. Li, Zhang, Liu, Kozak, &amp;&nbsp;Wen, 2020). Domestic tourism also slowed, perhaps as a result of individuals being reluctant to fly owing to concerns about the possible effects of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The declining number of tourists has cut into the profits of local businesses and tourism officials (Collins-Kreiner &amp;&nbsp;Ram, 2021).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A tourist village is a community that incorporates attractions, lodging, and ancillary services into a cohesive whole, all within the context of regular daily life and the customs and practices of the locals. The term tourist village refers to a community that combines modern amenities with a strong emphasis on preserving local culture and heritage (Havadi Nagy &amp;&nbsp;Espinosa Segui, 2020). A tourism village is a rural area that provides an authentic experience, beginning with the social culture, customs, everyday life, architecture of buildings and spatial structures of the village, and socio-economic life or economic activities that make the village special. in addition to being a promising area for the growth of other aspects of the tourist industry, such as attractions, lodging, food and drink, souvenirs, and so on (H. Van Nguyen, Diane, &amp;&nbsp;Newsome, 2020). A tourism village is one that has the potential to be both unique and distinctive as a tourist attraction, whether that be due to the physical characteristics of the rural natural environment or the socio-cultural life of the community, and which is managed and packaged in an attractive and natural way by developing tourism support facilities, in a harmonious environmental and management system. tourism economic activities that may enhance the welfare and empowerment of local communities; excellent and planned so that they are ready to accept and drive tourist visits to the community (Ramaano, 2022). Tourist communities have seen the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, leading to fewer visitors or possibly an absence of tourists altogether (Gao &amp;&nbsp;Cheng, 2020). Since the COVID-19 virus caused airlines to stop servicing Indonesia, few tourists have visited the country, and many individuals who work in the tourism business have returned home. This has left many residents of tourist towns unemployed (Lu, Li, &amp;&nbsp;Xu, 2020). The community realizes that in the midst of the devastating COVID-19 shock that has caused this economic decline there is still hope, so they spontaneously and actively remain united in reviving tourism village activities (Kastenholz, Marques, &amp;&nbsp;Carneiro, 2020). Tourism that offers rural nature is a very promising market opportunity in developing tourism villages (Ramaano, 2021). The locals will benefit financially from the creation of a tourist town (Yang et al., 2021).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A Green Economy is a form of economic governance that prioritizes people's health, social justice, and the environment before profit. A Green Economy is one that uses little or no fossil fuels, conserves natural resources, and treats its people fairly. A green economy is one that does not have any negative effects on the natural world (Dai, Rao, Liu, Mohsin, &amp;&nbsp;Taghizadeh-Hesary, 2022). The term green economy is often used to refer to an economic model that may boost social welfare and equity. Although social goals such as sustainable development, social equality, and poverty reduction do not always materialize automatically, the green economy is still a tool or means that is expected to be able to provide these results: new sources of income and employment; low carbon emissions; reduced use of natural resources; and reduced increase in pollution and waste (Howson, 2021). However, in order to achieve these social aims, we need to tether green economic endeavors to certain institutional policies. In supporting the success of a green economy concept that aims to improve economic aspects through development activities that do not override environmental sustainability (TL Nguyen, 2022).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After much delay, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the COVID-19 pandemic is a serious threat to global health (Dzigbede &amp;&nbsp;Pathak, 2020). Even in Indonesia, the COVID-19 virus has moved rapidly and deftly to many regions of the nation. The impact of COVID-19 extends well beyond the realm of mental health to permeate other</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">areas of society and the global economy (Dzigbede &amp;&nbsp;Pathak, 2020). The policy of limiting social activities given by the government caused the situation to become even more paralyzed so that the food chain sector, including meat supply, experienced shocks (Osinubi &amp;&nbsp;Olomola, 2021). The whole tourist industry will feel the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. With so many people canceling their trips and fewer people making reservations, it's clear that the tourism sector is feeling the pinch (Payne, Gil-Alana, &amp;&nbsp;Mervar, 2022). Since the outbreak of the pandemic, tourist arrivals have decreased drastically so that it has had an impact on the actors and activists of the Tourism Village (Wu, 2021). Villages that focus on tourism have a great chance to fulfill communal welfare by developing all of their resources in a way that is tailored to their specific requirements (Wang, Wang, He, &amp;&nbsp;Zhu, 2022).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The tourism industry, particularly tourist towns, was hit hard by the COVID-19 epidemic, which destroyed all previous regulatory mechanisms. The ban on the locals engaging in their normal activities has reduced business in several tourist communities. The effects are also seen in the field of tourist administration (Z. Li, Zhang, Yang, Singer, &amp;&nbsp;Cui, 2021). However, despite the economic blow brought on by the COVID-19 epidemic, a well-managed tourist resort will continue to attract visitors (Orîndaru et al., 2021). The Green Economy Transition is referred to as the right concept of economic development because it is able to create jobs and improve the welfare of a just society and maintain the carrying capacity and quality of the tourist village environment (Panzer-Krause, 2022). Various organizations define the Green Economy idea as a tool for long-term resource preservation (Bergius, Benjaminsen, Maganga, &amp;&nbsp;Buhaug, 2020). To understand the possible trade-offs and synergies between the economic and environmental components (without ignoring social concerns) is central to the concept of Green Economy, which is multifaceted in nature. The rise of the Green Economy has reaffirmed the felt need of environmental preservation and opened up opportunities for tourist investment (Markose, Tazhathethil, &amp;&nbsp;George, 2022). The term green economy refers to an economic theory that has the potential to greatly lessen environmental dangers while simultaneously promoting human flourishing and social justice (Ma, Hong, &amp;&nbsp;Chen, 2022).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A tourism village is a kind of development project that may be used to improve locals' standard of living. However, the use of natural resources to facilitate tourist growth will have an effect on the natural environment's ability to be maintained (Bachelor, 2021). The use of green space for the purpose of creating tourist attractions is one example of natural exploitation. The Green Economy idea is urgently needed to remedy this situation (Wayan, Dewi, &amp;&nbsp;Sutama, 2021). To be established in places that use eco-friendly tourist practices, the notion of Green Economy must be able to increase living standards and social justice while reducing the possibility of actual environmental harm (Sugiyanto, Tiurmida, &amp;&nbsp;Triono, 2022). The tourist industry is an important part of the Green Economy. Sustainable and able to raise living standards in rural areas, Green Economy implementation in the tourist industry takes the shape of tourist Village Development (Basuki, Wonoseputro, &amp;&nbsp;Tarigan, 2023). In the results of the investigation (Apriantoro, Rahayuningsih, &amp;&nbsp;Sarwanto, 2022) that The idea of green economy may boost community economic well-being and lessen the likelihood of severe environmental harm. Furthermore, as shown by (L. Li et al., 2022) a stronger organic growth of the village and higher incomes for its residents as a result of the green economy transition.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>METHOD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The research adopts a quantitative design and an associative approachin looking at causal relationships (Sugiyono, 2017). So, there is an independent variable or influence variable, namely the green economy and the dependent variable as the affected variable, namely people's income during the COVID-19 era. The type of data is primary data which is obtained directly from research respondents. The research was conducted in tourist villages in West Java Province, namely: Alamendah Tourism Village, Bandung and Saung Ciburial Garut Tourism Village, and Lampung Province tourist villages, namely: Harapan Jaya Tourism Village, Kiluan Negeri Tanggamus Tourism Village, Rigis Jaya Tourism Village, West Lampung and Way Kalam Tourism Village, Lampung. South. The research period was carried out under the conditions of COVID-19 for the 2022 period. Data collection was carried out from respondents targeting tourism village communities in West Java and Lampung Provinces. Sampling using random sampling to ensure that each member of the population has the same opportunity to be selected as a sample so that the number of samples used is 500 respondents (Purwanto, 2019). Collecting data using a questionnaire and measuring indicators used is a Likert Scale.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Green Economy Transition in Tourism Villages and Society Income in the COVID-19 era</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The concept of Green Economy is a new paradigm in economic development to replace old policies and does not favor long-term solutions and ecosystems, therefore a green economy</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">is the best solution for policy makers to balance environmental preservation and economic growth (Toubes &amp;&nbsp;Araújo-Vila, 2022). The Covid-19 Pandemic severely impacted the tourism industry, including the administration of tourist villages, which is why it is now standard practice for all tourist villages to govern themselves in accordance with the Green Economy Concept (Saliman, Wibowo, Widiastuti, &amp;&nbsp;Rosardi, 2021).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The results of the study provide facts about the transition of a tourist village to the green economy concepthas a strong influence in increasing the income of tourism village communities in West Java Province and Lampung Province in the conditions of the COVID-19 shock. This is because the green economy concept encourages sustainable practices in the utilization of natural resources and environmental preservation. By maintaining a healthy ecosystem, tourism villages can attract tourists who are attracted by nature and its pristine natural beauty. This will ensure a sustainable attraction for tourists, which in turn can increase revenue. The green economy promotes income diversification through the sustainable use of natural resources. The shift to a green economy encourages the adoption of new technologies and knowledge focused on sustainability. This kind of innovation can improve efficiency and productivity, which in turn contributes to higher revenues. Tourism villages that focus on a green economy can market themselves as eco-friendly and sustainable tourism destinations. This could appeal to tourists who are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their travels. With the right branding, tourism villages can build a positive image that contributes to increased visits and income.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tourist communities that embrace the idea of green economy are in a better position to develop a distinct appeal for visitors. The design of a tourist village is created in accordance with the natural conditions that surround the community that is used as a tourist object. Additionally, various natural potentials are combined with the living conditions of the community to become an appropriate collaboration and innovation is carried out in the tourist village with the green economy concept to make the tourist village more appealing so that the village tourism is eyed by many people. When visitors arrive in the town, there will undoubtedly be a resurgence of the local economy.It is possible that the construction of a tourist town based on the idea of a green economy would bring advantages in the form of an increase in people's incomes, which will allow the community to experience a substantial influence from an economic point of view. There are a lot of new career possibilities that the community in this area may take advantage of, such as providing a range of culinary delicacies that are characteristic of tourist settlements. Aside from that, the community of the village is able to engage in a variety of productive activities as a result of the presence of a tourist village. Some examples of these activities include the processing of handicrafts. Not only that, but the presence of a tourist village also has an effect on the communities that surround the village. One of these impacts is the growth of the town's ability to house a large number of micro, small, and medium-sized businesses (MSMEs). The combination of the idea of green economy with the tourist village has had a stunning effect, the most notable of which is the significant increase in the number of people who have visited the tourist village by purchasing one of the various tour packages.The level of economic activity that takes place in the vicinity of the tourist village is directly proportional to the degree to which the community and the decision-makers in the tourist village manage their tourism-related endeavors. This includes the manner in which they promote tourism in the tourist village so that it is known in the surrounding community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The management of all tourist villages in West Java and Lampung provinces has implemented the green economy concept in various aspects of its activities. Tourism village</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">managers must prioritize the use value and quality of tourist villages to maintain the comfort of visitors. Managers maintain the environment by buying or making equipment that can be used as a means of protecting the environment. This is done to ensure that even if there is a limited amount of cash available, the natural tourism village can still stay viable and that the management will still profit from the construction of a tourist village. To accomplish this goal, waste disposal sites made of wood, toilets, or other suitable permanent disposal sites, as well as sources of clean water, should be constructed. In addition, a tourist town that does a good job of going with the flow of nature will help the local environment and ecology to remain mostly unchanged. When it comes to successfully constructing a tourist village that is supported by a green economy, compatibility with the natural environment is the most important factor. The idea behind the tourist town is to include natural elements into the design of the attractions that are made available, such as a steep camping site that guests may take advantage of throughout their time there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The presence of garbage in tourist villages is a major problem in keeping the environment beautiful. Garbage is also a real disease that can disrupt environmental sustainability. In managing the waste generated by visitors, various efforts must be made that still pay attention to environmental aspects. The efforts made by the manager are that the manager prepares a trash bin that separates organic, non-organic and plastic waste. The local community has a vital role in waste management. The local community regulates and maintains the health and cleanliness of the environment, in order to create a beautiful environment that impacts the health and safety of the community itself. Furthermore, tidiness and diversity of functions is an important thing to do in a tourist village with the green economy concept. This is because it will make it easier for managers to keep the environment beautiful. The tourist landscape that is owned can be put to good use by managers such as structuring locations in tourist villages that adjust to their potential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Diversity is important in tourism. With a variety of attractions, attracting interest for tourists who have just visited the tourist village. Then in designing a concept can be done by yourself or with the help of various parties. Intervention from other parties can provide convenience in accelerating the development of tourist villages. The tourism village manager also together with the surrounding community organizations manages it further. The role given is also an active role and with various efforts made it still upholds aspects of environmental sustainability such as routinely cleaning the tourist village area. In building a tourist village, it must be with the approval of the entire surrounding community. If development is not carried out with the approval of parties in the village, Of course there will be potential for misunderstanding. Because of this, one of the characteristics of a tourist village is that it is managed by the local community in addition to community organizations, all of which play an extremely important part in the process of keeping a tourist village in operating shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This study's results are consistent with the underlying hypothesis. According to Midgley (1997), wellbeing is a state of human existence achieved by the effective resolution of societal issues, the satisfaction of fundamental human wants, and the expansion of available social possibilities (Arbulú et al., 2021). A form of development is required that brings together economic growth directly without causing a decline in the environment in order to guarantee a good quality of human life, and social welfare makes an effort to synergize with various disciplinary relationships, such as its relation to the environment, specifically the concept of tourism and green economy. in the future as well as the present (Adnyana et al., 2020). This finding has a direction that is in line with the hypothesis developed by the researcher</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(Apriantoro et al., 2022) that The idea of green economy may boost community economic wellbeing and lessen the likelihood of severe environmental harm. Furthermore, as shown by (L. Li et al., 2022) that the green economy transition in the village become an economic advantage and be able to make village endogenous development better and the community is able to earn more income.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The locals may be able to better use the resources available to them if a tourist village exists in their area. The growth of tourism will have several effects on the local community because of its direct interaction with and participation in it (Putri, Mahmud, &amp;&nbsp;Aminy, 2022). This is what the management has to focus on in order to keep the tourism village running well, since the presence of visitors who come to visit tourist villages means more money for the local economy (Susiyanto, 2022).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">This study analyzes the green economy transition in tourism, especially tourist villages, whether it is able to provide inspiration or actually prevent an increase in people's income in conditions of the COVID-19 shock. Because of the COVID-19 shock, the findings of the research reveal data on how the transition of a tourist village to the green economy concept has a big effect in raising the revenue of tourism village communities in the provinces of West Java and Lampung. These provinces are located in Indonesia. This is due to the fact that the green economy concept encourages sustainable practices in the utilization of natural resources and environmental preservation. By maintaining a healthy ecosystem, tourism villages can attract tourists who are attracted by nature and its pristine natural beauty. This will ensure a sustainable attraction for tourists, which in turn can increase revenue. The green economy promotes income diversification through the sustainable use of natural resources. The shift to a green economy encourages the adoption of new technologies and knowledge focused on sustainability. This kind of innovation can improve efficiency and productivity, which in turn contributes to higher revenues. Tourism villages that focus on a green economy can market themselves as ecofriendly and sustainable tourism destinations. This could appeal to tourists who are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their travels. With the right branding, tourism villages can build a positive image that contributes to increased visits and income.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In both a theoretical and practical sense, the results of this research are anticipated to give a reference for bolstering the tourist village program. This will allow the program to contribute to the growth of the economic sector of the community while also making the protection of the environment more convenient. The reason for this is because the problem of maintaining a healthy environment plays a very important role in the process of maintaining a healthy economy. Management of tourist villages with the green economy concept in an effort to develop tourism that is directed at eco-friendly and sustainable tourism which is certainly able to increase people's economic income so that people's living standards have increased</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Future researchers are encouraged to expand upon the one framework explored here the green economy by studying the role of community-based tourism (CBT) in boosting local incomes and examining the long-term viability of the built tourism infrastructure (sustainable tourism). Further research is encouraged to investigate, study, and compare tourist villages in other Asian countries, such as those in Thailand and China, so that they may serve as references in the development of Indonesia's own tourist villages, which this study only examines in West</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Java and Lampung. This study tested just during the COVID-19 pandemic, hence future studies should be carried out at this time period.</span></p>
