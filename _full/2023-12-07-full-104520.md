As human activity occurs at the surface which is influenced by surface currents understanding surface currents is crucial Ocean currents are not solely caused by wind but also of other factors such as sea surface temperature To obtain surface current data BMKG used HF radar installed in several places including Flores Sea This location is significant because it has large ports and heavy crossing traffic This study aims to analyse surface current data retr
