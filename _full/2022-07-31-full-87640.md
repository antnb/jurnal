Paving block is one of the building materials used as the top layer of the road structure other than asphalt and concrete Nowadays many choose paving blocks to be used in park areas pedestrians walks yard parking lots and so on This study aims to determine the value of compressive strength and water absorption after adding reinfocement using harmonica wire as much as 0 1 2 and 3 layers The method used is the compressive strength and water absorption test
