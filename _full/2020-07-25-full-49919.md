Shear force in general greatly contributes to cause failure of castellated beams so diagonal stiffeners on the openings are required Optimization was done by vary dimension of openings and diagonal stiffeners Finite element method is utilized to perform nonlinear analysis The objective of this research is to compare the numerical results of castellated beams without diagonal stiffeners with AISC design procedures that provided in Steel Design Guide 31 AISC 2016
