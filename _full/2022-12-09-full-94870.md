<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Language is a form that shall allow people to communicate their thoughts and feelings to one another. Noises, symbols such as written or spoken words, postures, gestures, or signs can all be used to transmit feeling and thought, with the receiver interpreting a specific meaning (Day Translations, 2018). Language is used by humans to communicate. The process of receiving and transmitting messages using verbal or nonverbal means, such as speaking, oral, writing, charts, signs, signals, and actions, is known as communication (Nordquist, 2019). In the study of language, pragmatics concern how language is used among people in context. According to Yule (1996) the significance of studying language through pragmatics is that one can discuss people’s intended meanings, their two presuppositions, their aims or goals, and the types of action they are showing when they speak. However, each has their own style of expressing their beliefs, which can often be expressed through speech act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A speech act is something that is said with the aim of not only informing but also showing something. According to Austin (1962: 94) speech act is explained by saying something is also to do something. That means, when the speaker says something, it is more than just uttering words; the utterance also has the intent to perform acts. Austin also divided speech act into three kinds. They are locutionary act, illocutionary act and perlocutionary act. Locutionary act is an act of saying something that occurs when the speaker and the hearer convers. Illocutionary act is an act performed in the utterances of the speaker that might cause the hearer to do something. Perlocutionary act is an act that is the hearer performed after hearing to the speaker utterance in certain context. According to Searle (1979: viii) the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">illocutionary act is divided into five parts. Assertive, directive, commissive, declaration, and expressive. Assertive illocutionary act indicates that the speaker wanted to inform others about how things are going. The speaker uses a directive illocutionary act to make people to do something; it expresses what the speaker requires. Commissive illocutionary act is the speaker committed to do something. Expressive illocutionary act is an act express the speaker attitudes, feeling and emotion. The expression is apologizing, congratulating, thanking, wishing, attitude, and greeting. Declaration illocutionary act is an act that the speaker uses their words that can bring about change in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Halliday and Hasan (1985: 12) context of situation divided into three parts. Field, tenor and mode. Field refers to the taken place and what is happening. Tenor refers to the actors, the players, what kinds of relationships among the participants, and mode refers to what language is used in that situation.

The aims of her study were to identify the types of expressive illocutionary act and find out the meaning of the utterance expressive illocutionary act. Her data were analyzed by using quantitative and qualitative descriptive method and theory proposed by Searle (1969).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second study by Pratama (2019) entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Function of Expressive Illocutionary Act with Special Reference to Chbosky and Spiliotopoulus’s Beauty and The Beast</span><span class="font3">. His study aims to identify the functions of expressive illocutionary act and the context of situation applied in the movie </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Beauty and The Beast</span><span class="font3">. His study used qualitative descriptive method and theory by Searle (1979) to analyze the data. The last is journal by Sirwan and Yulia (2017) entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">An Analysis of Expressive Speech Acts Used by Steve Rogers as The Main Character in Civil War Movie</span><span class="font3">. Their journal focused to explain kinds of expressive speech act used and the S-P-E-A-K-I-N-G model used by Steve Rogers in Civil War movie. Their data analyzed by using the theory by Searle, watching the movie and reading the movie script to collected the data. This article focuses on the types of expressive illocutionary act.
