<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract*</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The novel “Budha, A Story of Englightenment” is one of popular novels with New York Times Best Selling authors. This novel tells story as an icon of peace and serenity. The sentences with prepositional phrase and their translations from English into Indonesian are found in this novel. Therefore, the author is interested in analyzing the translation process occured in translating the source text into target text. The source text is analyzed and viewed to find out the translation of prepositional phrase. The translation is the proccess of transferring form from the first language into second language using semantic structure. This study aims at analyzing the source text and get the meaning and its translation. It is stated that a prepositional phrase is a group of words consisting of a preposition, its object, and any words modifying the object. A prepositional phrase also modifies a verb or a noun. There are two kinds of prepositional phrases which are called adverbial phrases and adjectival phrases. There are some complex prepositional phrases. Those are as for, except for, according to, by means, on the part of, etc. This present study is intended to: (i) identify the types of lexical and syntactical forms of the English prepositional phrases found in the data source “Budha, A Story of Englightenment”, (ii) analyze the types of shifts of prepositional phrases that were applied in the translation from source text into target text in the novel “Budha, A Story of Englightenment”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The translation can be meant as the proccess of transferring the form from the first language into the second language by using semantic structure. The source language must be transferred and held constant and the form of its translation may change. However, the translation activities do not only deal with transferring language from one language into another language, but also deal with the most important thing. Those are the process of transferring the message and the meaning from source language into target language. Catford (1965) stated that as a process, translation is always performed in a given direction from a source language into target language. There are some dificulties in translating an English text into Indonesian. Besides, there are also some external factors that contribute to such differences that is called as a culture. However, there are some strategies and procedures that can be done to the solutions to such difficulties. It is important for the translator to make assesment as needed in order to make the product of translation to be readable and understandable. As an object in this study, in translating an English text into Indonesian, the use of prepositions can be one of the things that make the process of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">translation to be complicated. It can be seen from the illustration that the preposition ‘with’ is equivalent to ‘dengan’. The prepositions can contribute to the fact that it is difficult to translate prepositional phrase into target text. Therefore, this inspires the author of this study to discuss the prepositional phrase and its translation analysis. In analyzing the translation process, the author choose the novel entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Budha, A Story of Englightenment.</span><span class="font2"> It is a novel that was written by Dheepak Chopra. The author tried to bring the Buddha back to life in this gripping account of the young prince who abandoned his inheritance to discover his true calling. This study analyzes the syntax structure of prepositional phrase and finds out about the form of prepositional phrase found in the novel. In analyzing the prepositional phrase in the translation process occured, this study used the theory proposed by Jackson (2000). According to the theory of prepositional phrase that is proposed by Jackson (2000), phrase is divided into noun phrase, verb phrase, adjective phrase, adverbial phrase and prepositional phrase. Prepositional phrase can be meant as a combination of two elements “preposition’ and ‘phrase’. In prepositional phrase, there are the relation between a noun and a verb. Moreover, Downing and Locke (2006) stated that preposition consists of two types. Those are simple preposition and complex preposition. In simple preposition, preposition has single prepositional particle. Part of single prepositional particle are: about, across, after, around, as, at, in, towards, etc. In complex preposition, preposition is formed by the combination of two prepositional particles. It is separated with a noun, an adjective, an adverb, and even phrases. The complex prepositional particles are as follows: as for, except, according to, by means, in return for, on the part of, etc. It is stated that simple prepositional phrase is a phrase consisting of a single prepositional word and followed by modifiers or complements. The complements consist of a noun, a noun group, a pronoun, an adverb, an adjective, a prepositional phrase, and a wh-clause. In complex prepositional phrase, phrase consists of two or three prepositions. It is modified with a noun, noun group, a pronoun, an adverb, an adjective.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">In analyzing the translation process, this study uses the theory of prepositional phrase that is proposed by Downing and Locke (2006). There are two types of prepositional phrases. Those are simple prepositional phrase and complex prepositional phrase. The theory of prepositional phrase proposed by Downing and Locke (2006) stated that in simple prepositional phrase, a phrase consists of a single prepositional word and it is followed by modifiers or complements. The complements can be a noun, a noun group, a pronoun, an adverb, an adjective, a prepositional phrase. In complex prepositional phrase, it consists of two or three prepositions and mostly modified with noun, noun group, adverb, adjective, preposition, conjunction. The modifiers can be a noun, an adjective, an adverb, and preposition, or phrase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This study also uses the theory of translation to analyze the translation shift found in the sentence containing English prepositional phrase. In analizing the translation process, this study also uses the theory proposed by Catford (1965) in order to analyze the translation process which occurred in the sentence containing prepositional phrase. In the translation of shift, Catford (1965) stated that, shift is the departure from formal correspondence in the process from the SL into the TL. The translation shift is applied to have the natural equivalent of the source text message into the target text. Moreover, Catford (1965) stated that the translation shift divides the shift in translation into two types, namely: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">level/rank shift</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">category shift.</span><span class="font2"> Catford (1965) considers that there are two types of shift, namely: (1) Shift of level and (2) shift of category. The translation process in this study is applied using the theory proposed by Catford (1965). The form</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of prepositional phrase is analyzed using the theory that is proposed by Downing and Locke (2006).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the category of shift, it is stated as the departures from formal correspondence in translation. It is stated that formal correspondence is any grammatical category in the target language which can be said to occupy the same position in the system of the target language as the given source language category in the source language system. The category of shift can be divided again into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">structure shifts, class shifts, unit shift,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">intra-system shifts. Structure shift</span><span class="font2"> is the changing of words sequence in a sentence. In the intra-system shift, it refers to the shifts that occurs internally, within the system; that is for those cases where the source and the target language possess systems which approximately correspond formally as to their constitution, but when translation gets selection of a non-corresponding term in the target language system. Intrasystem shifts can happen when a term is singular in the source language and its textual equivalent is plural. Moreover, Halliday stated that a class as that grouping of members of a given unit that is defined by operation in the structure of the unit next above. It is stated that class-shift occurs when the translation equivalent of a SL item is a member of a different class from the original item.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Translation-shift is used as the focus of analysis because the translator has shifted the forms to keep the meaning constant so that the messages can be communicative and natural. This study tries to find out the shifts in form and meaning of prepositional phrase from English into Indonesian Language. This is conducted because the core of equivalence and shifts are in the form and meaning. As we can see that an equivalence and shifts, the meaning is more important than the form. The data used in this study is the novel entitled “Budha, A Story of Englightenment”. The data source is written in English. The reason of using this novel as the data source is because there are some English prepositional phrases found in this novel. The novel that is used is one of popular novels with the best author. This study used the technique called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">teknik pilah</span><span class="font2"> that is proposed by (Sudaryanto, 2015). The data source is written in two languages, namely: English and Indonesian language. The data source is analyzed in English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Moreover, Downing and Locke (2006) stated that preposition consists of two types. Those are simple preposition and complex preposition. It can be seen that in simple preposition, preposition has single prepositional particle. Part of single prepositional particles are: about, across, after, around, as, at, in, towards, etc. In complex preposition, the preposition can be formed by the combination of two prepositional particles. It can be separated with a noun, an adjective, an adverb, and even phrases. The complex prepositional particles are as follows: as for, except, according to, by means, in return for, on the part of, etc. It is stated that simple prepositional phrase is a phrase consisting of a single prepositional word and followed by modifiers or complements. The complements are consisting of a noun, a noun group, a pronoun, an adverb, an adjective, a prepositional phrase, and a wh-clause. In complex prepositional phrase, phrase consists of two or three prepositions. It can be modified with a noun, noun group, a pronoun, an adverb, an adjective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This study also uses Intra-system shift that is proposed by Catford which refers to the shifts that occurs internally, within the system; that is for those cases where the source and the target language possess systems which approximately correspond formally as to their constitution, but when translation involves selection of a non-corresponding term in the target language system. It is stated that Intra-system shifts occurs when a term is singular in the source language and its textual equivalent is plural.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">We can see from the prepositional phrase that is available in text I stating that prepositional phrase </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">for him</span><span class="font2"> is formed by using preposition (for) +pronoun (him).

The unit shift occurs when the translation equivalent of a source text unit at one rank. It is stated that unit shift can be meant as the change in rank, that is, the departure from formal correspondence in which the translation equivalent of a unit at one rank in the source language. This shift is called as unit shift, that is, a change in higher rank that translates </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">confident</span><span class="font2"> into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sangat yakin</span><span class="font2">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">In analyzing the translation process, this study uses the theory of prepositional phrase proposed by Downing and Locke (2006). There are two types of prepositional phrases. Those are simple prepositional phrase and complex prepositional phrase. The theory of prepositional phrase proposed by Downing and Locke (2006) stated that in simple prepositional phrase, a phrase consists of a single prepositional word and it is followed by modifiers or complements. The complements can be a noun, a noun group, a pronoun, an adverb, an adjective, a prepositional phrase. In complex prepositional phrase, it consists of two or three prepositions and mostly modified with noun, noun group, adverb, adjective, preposition, conjunction. The modifiers can be a noun, an adjective, an adverb, and preposition, or phrase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This study also uses the theory of translation to analyze the translation shift found in the sentence containing English prepositional phrase. Translation-shift can be used as the focus of analysis because the translator has shifted the forms to keep the meaning constant, therefore the messages can be communicative and natural. This study found out the shifts in forms and meaning of prepositional phrase in translating from English into Indonesian Language. This study is conducted because the core of equivalence and shifts are in the form and meaning. As we can see that in an equivalence and shifts, the meaning is more important than the form. The data that is used in this study is the novel entitled “Budha, A Story of Englightenment”. The data source is written in English. The reason of using this novel as the data source is because there are some English prepositional phrases found in this novel. Moreover, it is one of popular novels with the best author. This study used the technique that is called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">teknik pilah</span><span class="font2"> that is proposed by (Sudaryanto, 2015). The data source is written in two languages, namely: English and Indonesian language. The data source had been analyzed in English.</span></p>
