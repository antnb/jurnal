<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Penelitian ini berjudul DVD Covers: A Study of Semiotics. Semiotik adalah bidang akademis yang mempelajari ilmu tentang tanda. Semiotik secara umum memberikan kita penjelasan mengenai segala sesuatu yang berhubungan dengan tanda seperti: tulisan, gambar, pertunjukkan, produksi multimedia, sinyal lampu jalan, kehidupan sehari-hari, dan lain-lain. Sampul DVD dapat dikatakan sebagai iklan yang ditujukan untuk menarik perhatian dari calon pembeli. Desain sampul DVD sangat berperan karena hal itu merupakan unsur pemasaran yang digunakan untuk menarik pembeli. Berdasarkan penjelasan di atas, sangat menarik untuk membahas studi semiotik di sampul DVD karena beberapa alasan. Pertama, semiotic di sampul DVD jarang dibahas. Di samping itu, cukup menantang untuk menganalisa apa saja unsur semiotik (penanda – arti) dan koherensi antara tanda verba dan visual dari sampul DVD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Data diambil dari lima macam sampul DVD yang berbeda, yaitu Skyfall, MAMA, Ted, Love Actually, dan The Smurf. Ada dua tahap dalam pengumpulan data. Pertama, lima sampul DVD yang digunakan sebagai data di penelitian ini diunduh dari </span><a href="http://www.getdvdcover.com"><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">www.getdvdcover.com</span></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> yang menyediakan berbagai macam sampul DVD. Lalu, data yang terkumpul diobservasi dan diklasifikasikan. Data di penelitian ini akan dianalisa menggunakan metode kualitatif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hasilnya menunjukkan bahwa setiap sampul DVD memiliki aturan tersendiri dari konsep penanda dan artinya yang memberikan makna baik secara verba dan visual yang membentuk karakteristik dari film. Penanda verba di sampul DVD adalah sinopsis, fitur special, logo dan akreditasi. Sementara itu penanda visual adalah gambar (tokoh), keadaan (tempat, waktu) dan suasana hati (warna)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Makna penanda verba dan visual yang ditemukan dalam sampul DVD yang digunakan sebagai data penelitian adalah untuk menyampaikan pesan kepada calon pembeli. Penanda verba memiliki peran untuk memberi informasi, sementara penanda visual mempercantik sampul sehingga menarik perhatian dari calon pembeli. Koherensi dari penanda verba dan visual dalam iklan akan membantu konsumen untuk mengerti pesan yang terdalam film.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Kata Kunci: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Semiotik, Penanda Verba dan Visual, Sampul DVD</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Semiotics is the academic field dedicated to the study of signs. According to Chandler (2001), semiotics can be applied to anything which can be seen as signifying something - in other words, to everything which has meaning within a culture. Even within the context of the mass media we can apply semiotic analysis to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">any media texts (including television and radio programmes, films, cartoons, newspaper and magazine articles, posters and other ads) and to the practices involved in producing and interpreting such texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Based on some empirical studies, Rahmayanti (2006) mentioned that each advertisement has its own set of signifiers and signified concept and thus produce meaning, both verbally and visually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">DVD covers can be seen as an advertising means to draw attention of the prospective buyers. The design of a DVD cover is very important as this is also a marketing element that is used to attract the buyers. Based on the description above, it is interesting to discuss or study semiotics in DVD covers for some reasons. First, semiotics of DVD covers is rarely discussed. In addition to that, it is quite challenging to analyze what the semiotic elements (signifier – signified) are and the coherence between the verbal and visual signs on the DVD cover.</span></p>
