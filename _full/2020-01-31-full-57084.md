<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This research investigated the rhetorical moves in the introduction part to the research article written by graduate students in Linguistics master's study programs. The primary purpose of this research is to describe the pattern of rhetorical moves in the research article introductions in the field of Linguistics. The data collection technique was in the form of scientific article documentation consisting of seven research article introductions in English in the field of Linguistics. Researchers collected data in the form of text with document analysis and note-taking techniques. These research articles were taken from four different journal publishers in Indonesia, namely </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Alphabet, Kelasa, Batra, and Suar Betang</span><span class="font3">. The rhetorical analysis in this study involves the concept of the Project Justifying Model (PJM) proposed by Safnil (2010), which consists of four communicative moves that can describe the rhetorical moves of Indonesian writers. The validity of the data in this rhetorical pattern study used the triangulation of sources or data. The results of this study indicate that the seven introductions have different rhetorical moves. The four research article introductions taken from the Alphabet produced fewer rhetorical steps compared to the other three research articles. The most dominant signal found in the seven research article introductions is (move 4, step A) represents a statement in explaining the purpose of the study. The seven research article introductions found no statements that represented the five steps contained in each move.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">A research article must have an exciting introduction because this section has an appeal to the reader when starting to read a research article. In writing an introduction, it needs to be organized well, which is an essential part of introducing a research article. Moreover, the fact is in line with Swales &amp;&nbsp;Najjar (1987), Safnil (2013), and Muhtadin (2017), who stated that interesting research article should appeal to the reader to read the entire research article. So, the primary motivation in writing the research article introduction is to provide enough clues for the reader to convey the argument of the writer. If the introductory of the research article is not well organized, the research article would be difficult to recognize by the readers or hard to be published internationally. To minimize failure in organizing the introductory part of a research article, knowledge of systematic writing in the research article introduction is one of the relevant supporting factors. Safnil (2010 p.22) states that textual analysis makes it possible to examine text to see the Linguistic form and intention of the author through understanding some aspects of the text structure. To know the extent of the author's knowledge in organizing a research article introduction, we can analyze the writing. Hence the investigation of discourse analysis in the rhetorical moves of Indonesian academics needs to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rhetorical analysis model specifically devoted to capturing communicative purposes in Asian Research Article Introductions (RAIs) has been developed by Ahmad (1997). This model analysis is formed by adapting CARS produced by Swales (1990), which is named Project Justifying Model (PJM). The PJM model analysis differs from CARS, which is distinguished by four moves as a sign of communicative purposes in Indonesian RAIs based on Safnil (2013). Moreover, PJM contains four communicative moves that describe goals of Indonesian RAIs, which are broken down into sub-moves called steps that refer to textual or rhetorical forms. The four stages of the PJM analysis model are establishing shared schema, establishing the research field or scope, justifying the present research project, and announcing the research specification. PJM also has a Step on each move that can be used by Indonesian RAIs writers to achieve primary communicative purposes. Moreover, Safnil (2013) explained that the RAIs writer should</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Move 1 Establishing Shared Schemata by:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Step A: Defining key terms; and/or</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Step B: Referring to the government policy; and/or Step C: Giving a short history of the research field; and/or Step D: Describing the geographical setting of the research; and/or Step E: Making a general claim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Move 2 Establishing the Research Field by:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Step A: Introducing the actual research topic; and/or</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Step B: Identifying the research problem or phenomena; and Step C: Reviewing the current knowledge and practice. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Move 3 Justifying the Present Research Project by: </span><span class="font2">Step A: Indicating inconsistency in previous study results; or Step B: Claiming that the topic has never been explored; or Step C: Claiming that the topic is necessary to investigate; or Step D: Claiming interest in investigating a particular topic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Move 4 Announcing the Present Research by:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Step A: Announcing the research purposes; and/or</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Step B: Stating the research questions; and/or</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Step C: Describing the specific features of the research; and/or Step D: Stating the expected benefits of the research; and/or Step E: Announcing the principal findings; and/or Step F: Proposing the research hypothesis; and/or Step G: Suggesting a solution to the research problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">use at least one move among the four moves as a form of communicative purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An investigation conducted by Alkarima (2019) produced evidence of the phenomenon previously described. She took six RAs as data and selected from six different research articles publisher sites in Indonesia, which are nationally accredited. Alkarima (2019) investigated RAIs in the fields of language and literature and found only 50% of these RAs contained rhetorical moves. In the same case, the population of this previous research involved is not too specific, and the result needs to be empirically verified. Thus, it can be pointed out; this previous study has two gaps, which include population gap and empirical gap. Sepni (2016) investigates the abstract and introduction in the rhetorical move. She looked into the analysis of text rhetoric and analysis of Linguistic features. Sepni (2016) involved the research introductory as a material to be analyzed. The study described the rhetorical structure of 50 research articles that were taken from the field of medical science and health. The finding of the investigation stated that the research articles are taken from the field of medicine most often use move two as a statement to justify the research topic. The fact has found before proved by the findings of move two, which frequently appears in the results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Furthermore, the finding of the previous study showed that the concept of PJM was not yet fully realized by the writers in the medical field. Thus, these results require further research to obtain a complete study and can provide valid references. Sepni (2016) also suggested adding literature to the concept of rhetorical structure to minimize problems in writing research articles to be published. The statement shows that there is a knowledge gap that makes the research less than optimal. The detailed sample description of the rhetorical structure of the results of the study cannot be found in this study either. Moreover, this study examines what can also conclude this has a practical-knowledge gap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It can be seen many academics in Indonesia still have not reached the standard in good introduction writing. PJM applied in Indonesian RAIs analysis can describe communicative goals and important rhetorical characteristics that refer to the features of Indonesian RAIs (Safnil, 2010). By using the convention in rhetoric, research articles produced by the writer can have possibilities to be recognized and accepted by international discourse communities. Agrawall (2015) shows that to be part of international research publications, non-native writers are not only focused on writing in English, but they should take part in the RA convention in English. Consequently, the writers’ RA can be accepted for international publication. It must be considered that the research article published internationally requires a complicated process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Based on the previous illustrations, the present study examined research articles that have been published, especially in Indonesia. The present study used an analysis model called Project Justifying Model (PJM), which is applied to the English RAIs written by Indonesian that has done before. The data of this research were RAs that written by graduate students’ of the Linguistic master program in that the researchers' claimed had not been examined before. Moreover, this research is desirable to conduct because the analysis model involves the point of view of pedagogy, especially for language teaching, which is supported by a statement from Safnil (2010). The researcher wants to see the informative purposes that organized by the graduate students’ of the Linguistic master program in their RAIs through the Project Justifying Model. The aim of this research is to describe the rhetorical moves organized by the graduate students of the Linguistic Master program in RAIs through the Project Justifying Model analysis. The finding of this study can be a comparison for research in the field of scientific writing and also provide better knowledge of the rhetorical features specifically written by Indonesian.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">This present research used the descriptive qualitative approach as the research design. The qualitative data presented tend to use word formations rather than using numbers that can apply to social anthropology, history, and political science states research (Miles and Huberman, 1994). Seven research article introductions were examined in this research analyzed through Project Justifying Model purposed by Safnil (2010). Four of the research articles are taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Alphabet </span><span class="font4">journal site and the last three are taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kelasa</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Batra</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Suar Betang journal site</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this research, the researcher is concerned with investigating the behavior of the students of Linguistics Master programs that related to the writing flow of their research articles. According to Holliday (2007), the primary aim of qualitative research is to get to the bottom of what is going on in all aspects of social behavior. The previous statement supported the setting of this research that involved the particular society that taken as the data.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Data collection in this study was carried out by reading, and writing sentences contained rhetorical moves. As mentioned by Sarwono (2006), the analysis of documents is a technique of collecting data by reading the contents of the research article. The collected data from the data source have analyzed based on indicators from PJM purposed by Safnil (2010) intended to reveal</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">patterns of rhetorical moves of research article introduction written by graduate students of Linguistics master programs. After that, the rhetoric pattern in the RAIs will be described on each </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> and in each </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">step</span><span class="font4">. The results are presented in the form of descriptions formulated in a table containing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">moves</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">steps</span><span class="font4"> included in each of these research articles. This analysis has done to facilitate the categorization of moves contained in these research articles. The findings in the form of tables provide codes from the move and step signals that exist in each research article. The validity of the data in this rhetorical pattern study used the triangulation of sources or data. The instrument used in this study was the researchers and presented in the table that contained sentences indicated rhetorical moves that collected from the analysis through PJM model analysis. Additionally, the researcher has been the instrument of this research that determines the overall research scenario.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The result of the analysis by using PJM is exposed to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> pattern of those research article introductions. It can be seen in Table 4.10, the seven research articles that organized are not similar. the most dominant signals found in the RAIs are in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 4 step A with a total of six</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">signals found, which shows the statements of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">describing research purposes</span><span class="font4">. Signals that are not found are five, which are </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 1 (step B, step C, step D), </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 3 (step C), </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 4 (step G). In the result of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 2 presents the completeness of the segment, which provides a RAIS interpretation containing a statement about the description in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">establishing the research field</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Meanwhile, it is unfortunate that all the observed RAIs do not complete the move 1, which should be the basis for information in writing an introduction. The evidence is mentioned, of the seven RAs, only four have step one, which is useful for explaining important terms of the research. Five RAIs were identified containing step E, which stated a general claim in the research. This fact is related to the assumption statement of the writer to direct the reader to the focus of the research conducted. A total of three steps in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 1 missing in all RAIs analyzed are step B, step C and step D. All three have similar functions, namely explanations that support the research term that has been introduced. According to PJM theory, statements regarding government policy, a brief history, and geographical explanation must be included in the introduction. The students chose not to give a sentence that stated the thing to their RAIs. Therefore, it can be concluded that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 1 there are no RAIs that have complete steps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 2 findings in all RAIs provide a good result because the description stated in all the steps. However, the facts found are that not all RAIs have these steps, which are segments that explain </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the establishing the research field</span><span class="font4">. Out of the seven RAIs, more than half of them includes a statement stating each </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">step</span><span class="font4"> in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 2. In the analysis, four RAIs revealed statements that stated the introduction of the actual research. The other thing can also be seen that as many as four RAIs write statements expressing the identification of a research problem called step B in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 2. The lowest signal of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> is proven in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">step</span><span class="font4"> C that is only found in two RAIs. Step C states that the results of the review carried out relate to knowledge of the research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not many signals are found in move 3, which is indicated by the few signals revealed. Based on figure 4.1, these four steps are found in one RAIs. Moreover, no signals have been found that lead to the step C statement in all of the RAIs. In fact, it is only one RAIs has been identified to express a statement that refers to the step A signal. Step A in the introduction serves to declare a signal that is inconsistent in previous studies. In other words, this step represents a review of gaps from previous studies which in fact were not noticed by the other six writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The same thing has found in step B, which is only found in one RAIs. This step aims to express statements that form claims from researchers on a research topic that has not been done before. The statement should be considered to provide consistent support for a research, but the fact happens in findings, the writer tends to ignore this part. In </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 3 is not found at all is step C, which identifies the statement containing a claim or sentence about the topic of the research being carried out is essential to be investigated. This step is beneficial for giving Justifying and convincing the reader that relevant research is necessary to conduct. The final findings in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 3 show that only one RAI contains statements referring to step D. This step expresses a statement on RAI that refers to the researcher's interest in conducting research. Then it can be concluded that the findings in this segment get the least rank compared to the signals found in other </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4">s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The final finding is the analysis of the rhetorical </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4">s of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 4, which has the most signals of all steps owned by step A. Figure 4.1 shows step A in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> four is the step that most often appears on the RAIs of Linguistics students. The statement regarding the introduction of research purpose appears almost at the end of the introductions section. This section provides clear research objectives to readers who previously discussed the justification of research. A total of six RAIs have been identified, which makes step A is one of the crucial aspects of writing the introduction section. The next signal is step B, which only appears on one RAIs. This step</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">provides a clue about the research problem. Next, step C was also found in the same RAIs in the case of steps E and F. Step D was found twice in the RAIs, which are the opposite of Step G which was not found at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The concept of rhetorical analysis called PJM is used in this research because it is better able to capture rhetorical signals that exist in Indonesian RAIs. Safnil (2010) formulated PJM in four communicative </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4">s contained in Indonesian RAIs. The finding that has been explained previously, in the rhetorical </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> theory called PJM purposed by Safnil (2010) supports the results of research on seven research article introductions. In Figure 4.1, it has been proven that all PJM indicators can be found in the seven RAIs except for the five steps in each </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4">. Additionally, PJM can describe the rhetorical </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The current research is carried out to reveal the quality of writing RAIs that can become potentially understandable at the international level. The completeness of each indicator makes an Indonesian RAI contain an explanation that can be conveyed effectively. Nevertheless, the facts found by the current research provide a different description of each introduction. The theory of Safnil (2013) rhetoric analysis used as an analysis of RAIs proves that some of these research articles have not contained complete </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4">s. On the other hand, the length of the introduction section written by student linguistic programs does not guarantee a complete </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4">. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4">s contained in RAIs are mostly arranged in a sequence that insists they have sufficiently organized </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4">s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the previous research, Alkarima (2019) conducted research using the concept of PJM involved RAI written by Indonesians. The results of the research stated that the rhetorical </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4">s identified were in accordance with PJM indicators. However, not all of the four </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4">s were found in the analyzed RAIs, which made the research show the same results. The similarity of the results of the research is incomplete </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4">s and steps. In the Alkarima findings, no step signals are found, but only analysis based on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4">s. The other results from Alkarimas' findings also state that the majority found four or three </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4">s in the RAIs. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Move</span><span class="font4">s and steps on Indonesian RAIs have also been investigated by Sepni (2016) involving research articles in the medical field. The results of Sepni's research show a similarity between the current research and her research. Sepni (2016) research explains Indonesian academics who write health research articles have a different percentage of PJM signals. The lowest percentage is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 3, which is 28%, which means these academics tend to miss the part of justifying the research being carried out. This fact is in line with the results of the current research, which showed three articles also unidentified </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 3. The other research also showed different results that were conducted by Muhtadin (2017). Research by Muhtadin (2017) involves Indonesian RAIs written by academics in the field of law. In discussing the results of the research, Muhtadin (2017) stated that the smallest percentage of his analysis was 48%, which stated </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font4"> 1. The result is different from the results of the current research were academics in the field of law tend to pay less attention to establishing shared schemata.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By considering the facts found in previous research, it can be concluded that graduate students in the Linguistic Master program have different patterns in rhetorical moves. Additionally, the current research has a limited number of RAIs are examined. The limited access to all research articles cannot cover the majority of graduate students in the Linguistic master's progra. This consideration needs to be done to get comprehensive coverage in order to get maximum data results. Additionally, the discourse analysis in rhetorical moves requires an extended analysis time because the data must be read intensively and also intensive checkups to get the objective findings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The finding of this study can be a comparison for research in the field of scientific writing and also provide better knowledge of the rhetorical moves features specifically written by Indonesian. This research can inspire future researchers to conduct this kind of research relatively used in discourse analysis. Project Justifying Model (referred to PJM) has been established firstly by Ahmad (1997) to identify non-native speaker RAIs. Ahmad introduced the PJM analysis model on his dissertation that was used to analyze Malaysian RAIs and his claims for the better rhetorical description of Malaysian academics when writing RA introductions through PJM.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The introduction section written by seven students in the Linguistic master program does not show the complete structure of the Project Justifying Model. Five steps do not appear at all in the research article introductions, and there are: moves 1 step A, step B, step C, step D; move 3 step C, and move 4 step G. Research articles that have been published nationally do not guarantee to have excellent rhetorical skills. Moreover, the length or the short writing of the introduction also does not guarantee the completeness of the rhetorical pattern.</span></p>
