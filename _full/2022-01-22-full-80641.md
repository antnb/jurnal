Collecting data using questionnaires and PLS analysis method. The results show the intention to use digital finance is influenced by financial literacy with medium significance and financial inclusion with a very strong significance.

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Financial literacy can be defined as knowledge that is basic in financial inclusion so that it is closely related to economic concepts to support decision making, be it investment, borrowing, and saving </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Agarwal, 2016)</span></a><span class="font5">. Knowledge of the financial system possessed can increase the ability of producers to benefit from competition between financial service providers </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Leyshon, Thrift, &amp;&nbsp;Pratt, 1998)</span></a><span class="font5">. Ownership of low financial literacy has an impact on daily financial management for both individuals and families and has an impact on the ability to save in the long term so that if management is not carried out effectively, it is vulnerable to a financial crisis </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Braunstein &amp;&nbsp;Welch, 2002)</span></a><span class="font5">. Financial literacy can be regarded as input in modeling needs related to education and variations of finance </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Huston, 2010)</span></a><span class="font5">. Financial knowledge is a form of investment in human resources which endogenously has an impact on welfare, with certain policies an increase in financial knowledge will occur in large numbers </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Lusardi &amp;&nbsp;Mitchell, 2014)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Financial literacy is an important ownership for MSME actors. The role of financial literacy has an impact on improving skills, to increasing the ability to touch financial products as indicated by the acceptance and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">using products as needed </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Deka, 2015)</span></a><span class="font5">. With financial literacy ownership the benefits of this can be felt. Having financial literacy or knowledge related to finance will get the opportunity to know the kind of financial services are available. If financial literacy increases, investment activities and long-term capital placements will increase in every productive sector </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Herdinata, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. Even so, in fact, in Indonesia the low level of financial literacy is still a problem and challenge in the future</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Damayanti, Murtaqi, &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Pradana, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Similarity with financial literacy, financial inclusion also has an important role to development MSME business. Financial inclusion is an activity to gain access to financial services by eliminating various barriers </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Lumenta &amp;&nbsp;Worang, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. Financial inclusion enables universal access and coverage financial services so their benefits for economy and development can be widely felt in various countries</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Senyo, Osabutey, &amp;&nbsp;Seny Kan,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. In addition, the important role of financial inclusion is also to narrow the economic gap as an effort to reduce barriers related to access and use financial services </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Yanti, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. Although infrastructure for banking has a faster average growth, its presence does not determine the adequacy of overall development and economic growth </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Myeni, Makate, &amp;&nbsp;Mahonye, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. Financial inclusion is not just open access but can influence on the development of MSMEs. The role is very important in increasing economic growth and development so that it becomes a solution to the problem about unemployment which has an impact on reducing poverty levels and increasing job opportunities </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Abduh, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5"> so that MSMEs development needs attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Along with developments, increasingly sophisticated technology changes every activity that was originally carried out conventionally into a digital-based that not only changes activities in one field but also in various fields. This also applies to MSME actors in carrying out business activities, they need the ability to adapt these conditions. In marketing activities, MSME actors compete to sell their products using the internet with a higher intensity than large businesses </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Abduh, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5">. Likewise in the financial sector, the emergence digital services is the result from innovation between the financial sector and technology, both provided by financial institutions and fintech companies. Innovations from technology and finance in research will focus on payments. Digital finance is technology, infrastructure, services, and financial products that provide convenience so that it is not done conventionally but can use the internet, computers, cellphones, or cards </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Ozili, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The emergence mobile wallet as a payment alternative with convenient and easy services can increase its use whether it is intended for online transactions, storing a certain amount of money, and to make other payments according to available technology </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Alwi, Salleh, Alpandi, Ya’acob, &amp;&nbsp;Abdullah, 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Donner (2008),</span></a><span class="font5"> states that using mobile phones based on Technology, Information and Communication (ICT) development can affect work and increase welfare levels. In 2019 the Susenas survey, internet access in Indonesia reached 47.69 percent of the population, which shows that the public has openness information and technological developments that can be well received so that it leads an information society</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Central Bureau of Statistics Indonesia,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2019)</span></a><span class="font5">. Based on this information, Indonesia is a country that has considerable potential in adopting digital payment financial services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are previous studies related to the variables involved. Financial literacy does not have a significant impact on adopting financial technology which is possible</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">due to the lack of financial literacy and financial technology understanding</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Herdinata,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. This is different from</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Shen, Hu, and Hueng (2018) </span></a><span class="font5">who found that increasing public financial literacy and popularizing internet use were an effort to introduce using digital financial products for progress in financial inclusion. Interventions from good financial literacy design can expand and promote digital payment and savings activities </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Chiwaula, Matita, Kamwanja, Cassim, &amp;&nbsp;Agurto, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. Financial literacy has an impact on entrepreneurial intentions to use the internet positively</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Bayrakdaroğlu &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Bayrakdaroğlu, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5">. Likewise in</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Nugroho and Apriliana (2021) </span></a><span class="font5">research which states that Islamic financial literacy also has a positive impact on the use of digital finance, in this case Go-Pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Relationship in other variables, Narok District, Kenya, the financial services existence such as mobile banking, agency banking, ATM, and online banking has a high influence on access as well as using banking financial services for women entrepreneurs </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Melubo &amp;&nbsp;Musau, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. For women entrepreneurs in Narok District, Kenya, Using online banking services is not only related to limitations in literacy, internet networks availability, and the ability to use computers but also requires socialization to confirm that digital services availability is known.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Myeni et al., (2020),</span></a><span class="font5"> in their research found that individual mobile money users have a high probability to have a formal banking account which could also be the result from offer role. The existence of a positive correlation between bank account ownership and higher users in urban areas does not increase these financial services reach for most rural communities. Expectations for business can also significantly increase the intention to use mobile money</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Senyo &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Osabutey, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. The availability of services in the form of mobile banking and the formulation of policies in shaping mobile banking services is very important so that both in terms of access and use it can increase so as to have a positive impact on financial inclusion </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Siddik, Sun, Yanjuan, &amp;&nbsp;Kabiraj, 2014)</span></a><span class="font5">. In contrast to the research conducted by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> C.O, C, C, C.O, and P (2020),</span></a><span class="font5"> financial inclusion is a problem for Nigeria, other developing countries are also faced with the next challenge, namely the lack of efficiency in the use of banking agents so that there is still limited space for service providers without strict regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Based on this explanation, this study will attempt to find out how the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion variables in increasing the intention to use digital payment services MSMEs in Bandung city. The area selection was based on a survey conducted where area-based internet usage in 2019 was 68.75 percent for urban areas while for rural areas it was 31.25 percent</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Central Bureau of</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Statistics Indonesia, 2019)</span></a><span class="font5"> which has great potential in the use of financial services. This research is important because to be able to compete and survive, MSMEs need to adapt to the changing environment. This research can certainly contribute to stakeholders to see how financial literacy and financial inclusion are obtained by MSME actors so that MSMEs intend to use digital financial services. Therefore, this study takes the variable of intention to use digital finance as a unique variable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Financial literacy ownership for the general public and MSMEs actor in particular is a basic thing that needs to be owned. The importance of financial literacy is due to several reasons, including literacy raises financial understanding so that financial problems can be overcome and possible to have several financial products such as insurance, savings, and diversification in investment activities</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Gunardi, Ridwan, &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Sudarjah, 2017)</span></a><span class="font5">. Financial literacy ownership also supports financial product service</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">facilities acceptance, because of the ability to choose and subsequently determine the best services usage and according to needs so that it can give an impact on increasing inclusion, </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Bongomin, Ntayi, Munene, &amp;&nbsp;Nkote Nabeta, 2016)</span></a><span class="font5"> impacting lifestyle and financial level well-being </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Hermawan, Gunardi, &amp;&nbsp;Agustine, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. For some communities, such as in rural areas, strategies implementation as an effort to increase infrastructure investment activities, financial education, and the introduce mobile money usage through roadshows is very necessary in increasing awareness and usage </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Myeni et al., 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. A high understanding regulations and cooperation application regulations can increase their financial literacy and end up with support for small and medium-sized businesses to adopt financial technology </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Herdinata, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. There are also several factors that influence internet banking usage, one of that is a poor knowledge about it </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Gerrard, Barton Cunningham, &amp;&nbsp;Devlin, 2006)</span></a><span class="font5">.

<p><span class="font5">Financial inclusion is important because it is related public to access financial services provided to be open or in other words removing barriers to access. The financial sector and fintech emergence are gateways that can increase business opportunities through mobile-based applications launch or other services in exploring these opportunities </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Stewart &amp;&nbsp;Jürjens, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. It is proven that greater open access to formal financial services emerges through financial technology (fintech) using which also has an impact on economic growth and sustainable and inclusive development</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Herdinata,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. Basically, financial inclusion is related to transactional activities so that it becomes a driving force for mobile money services (payments) usage</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Senyo </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font5">.,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. Activities to adopt payment products are the first step towards the next step, namely usage, while payment activities are the first step in creating financial inclusion </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Arun &amp;&nbsp;Kamath, 2015)</span></a><span class="font5">. Payments with mobile-based services for developing countries are an important tool to increase financial inclusion for the unbanked and play a role for funds cross-border in this case remittances </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Leng, Talib, &amp;&nbsp;Gunardi, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. Service channels availability with easy access and low costs can promote the level of financial inclusion with advantages such as timeliness, affordability, and related regulations so that the expansion for all society segments to use them can occur</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> (Melubo &amp;&nbsp;Musau,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2020)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>

Financial literacy is important for MSME actors to know. The financial literacy ownership for MSME actors can increase knowledge about financial services availability and financial institutions and then selected according to their needs and support their business activities. Financial literacy not only plays a better role in financial management but also encourages MSME actors to know the latest developments in the financial sector so that adjustments can be made to changes. Financial knowledge, actions on financial decisions, the ability to tell, manage, and related attitudes about finance as indicators of financial literacy which show that the financial literacy of MSME actors in Bandung City affects interest in using digital financial services. With the knowledge they have, MSME actors can find out the types of digital financial services available, know their functions and operations, and end up with the intention to use certain digital financial services according to their preferences and business needs. Therefore, financial literacy ownership can increase MSME actors intention to use digital financial services.</span></p>

Digital-based financial services existence, provided by financial institutions and fintech companies, have opportunity to improve facilities and community accessibility to touch these facilities. Increasing financial inclusion through service availability can lead to increased usage because the facilities are already provided. The popularity for using the service and the perceived ease of use also make this facility suitable with users expectations, in this case MSME actors. Obstacles that were previously a challenge can be minimized better. Now, most MSME players use digital financial services in their efforts to simplify and facilitate</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">consumers with various types of transactions. Therefore, the higher the level of financial inclusion, the more diverse the digital financial service facilities will be. This can certainly increase the intention of MSME actors to use digital financial services in line with the need to compete and the ability to adapt to a changing environment.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Financial literacy and financial inclusion ownerships are important for MSME actors. Financial literacy is knowledge related about finance and financial inclusion in minimizing existing obstacles so that the whole community in general can touch banking products. Along with the technology development, digital-based financial services have emerged, both offered by banks and fintech companies. Based on the results, financial literacy has an influence on the intention to use digital finance with moderate significance. Financial literacy ownership can increase knowledge about product availability until it the ends intentions to use services emergence that suit their needs and can support business activities. The next variable no less important is financial inclusion. Financial inclusion has a very strong influence on the intention to use digital finance. This shows very strong evidence on the relationship between variables. Financial inclusion as an effort to minimize barriers for access is helped by digital financial service presence. Financial inclusion with digital financial service facilities can increase MSME actors intention to using these facilities. This is in line with</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Otoritas Jasa</span></a><span class="font5"> Keuangan (2016) POJK regulation Number 76/POJK.07/2016 concerning Improvement of Financial Literacy and Inclusion in the Financial Services Sector for Consumers and/or the Community, there are two objectives of financial literacy, namely improving the quality of decision-making and changing attitudes and behaviors that have an impact on financial management so that in the end it can determine and utilize financial institutions and services that suit their needs as well as financial inclusion with the scope of expanding access to and providing financial products and/or services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This finding is expected to contribute fintech knowledge, especially payments, considering that research is still quite rare regarding the intention to use digital finance for MSME actors. The results expected to provide input for related parties disseminate financial knowledge and introduce the kind of financial services availability so that has impact on service use intentions, market coverage, and the better MSMEs development. Even so, the small number of samples used and not involving other factors are limitations in this study so that further research can involve a larger number for samples.</span></p>
