The success of reclamation is largely determined by many things including the fertility of the planting media The fertility of the planting media is related to fertilizer from the litter found in postmining land that can be utilized for making organic fertilizer The purpose of this study is to examine the ecological and economic aspects of leaf litter as organic fertilizer in the reclaimed land of limestone mining Method Laboratory experimental research with
