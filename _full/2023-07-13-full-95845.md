<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This research paper entitled “The Syntax Analysis of Adverb of Manner Found in the Novel “</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Wonderful Wizad of Oz”.</span><span class="font0"> This research study aimed to analyze the form of adverb of manner and its positions of adverb of manner found in the data source. This research study used the theory proposed by Brown and Miller (1991) in analyzing the tree diagram of adverb of manner and it was supported by other theories in analyzing the form and the position in adverb of manner found in the structure. Library research was the method used in collecting the data as the researcher read the data source before getting data in adverb of manner. The method that was used in analyzing data was qualitative method. The data were taken from the novel entitled “</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Wonderful Wizad of Oz</span><span class="font0">” that was written by W.W Denslow. The researcher of this study found that there was one form of adverb of manner found in the novel entitled “</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Wonderful Wizad of Oz</span><span class="font0">”. Adverb of manner found in the data source was an adjective followed by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ly-</span><span class="font0"> suffix. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">was one adverb of manner placed in the initial position and eight adverbs of manner placed in final position. They were adverb of manner that could be filled in the sentence structure in the form of adverb of manner.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">A sentence is stated as a grammatical unit in which there are one or more words. People usually express an idea, a question, subject and statements by using words and contain a subject and a verb. Many sentences can be built by sentences which unite as one. Phrases and sentences are built up of constituent series (syntactic units) and they serve grammatical function. The arrangement and the form of word were related in a sentence. Many words made some sentences in English as one unit. In a sentence, we can see subject, verb, complement, object and adverbial (SVCOA).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An adverb is stated as a word used to modify several types of words including an </span><a href="https://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/adjectives/"><span class="font2">adjective</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">,</span></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font2">a</span><a href="https://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/verbs/"><span class="font2"> verb</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">,</span></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font2">a</span><a href="https://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/adverb/adverb-clauses/"><span class="font2"> clause</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">,</span></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font2">another</span><a href="https://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/adverb/"><span class="font2"> adverb,</span></a><span class="font2"> or any other type of word or phrase, with the exception of determiners and adjectives, modifying nouns. We can understand adverbs by thinking about them as the words providing context. Adverbs give a description of how, where, when, in what manner and to what extent something is done. The examples of adverb of manner are hurriedly, quickly, slowly, and instantly. It functions to modify a verb or verb phrase. An adverb can give more information about the manner, time, place, and frequency. Meanwhile, adverbials are stated as words groups which an adverbial phrase tells us something about the verb. One of classifications of adverbials is called as adverb of manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The theory used to analyze the form and position of adverb of manner in this research study was proposed by Brown and Miller (1992). The theory stated that adverbial of manner indicates manner in which the event is described by the verb. An adverb of manner provided information about how the event could be described by the verb. Adverbial of manner explained on how an action can be performed and explained. An adverb of manner can be formed by an adjective and then followed by -ly suffix. An adverb of manner is formed by adding suffix </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘ly’</span><span class="font2"> to an adjective. An adverb of manner can be formed by an adjective followed by suffix –ly and prepositional phrase. An adverb of manner can be analyzed by using tree diagram in order to analyze the position of adverb of manner in constituent structure. The sentence structure can be known as syntactical identification by analyzing the constituent structure. Adverb of manner can fill in some variations of its position in the clause. Adverb of manner can be positioned in the initial, medial, and final position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are three previous study to be discussed in this research study. The first is the research study from Susnawati (2006). In her undergraduate thesis entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Analysis of Manner Adjunct in “The Witness” by Sandra Brown”</span><span class="font2"> describing about the phrase form of manner adjuncts and manner adjunct in the Form of Clause found in the Charlotte’s Web Novel. The forms of manner adjunct found in the Charlotte’s Web Novel were analyzed by using their constituents structured. There were two problems of the study that was discussed in this research paper. The first was to analyze about form of manner adjunct that occurs in the novel entitled “The Witness” by Sandra Brown and how their constituents structured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The second was to analyze about the position of manner adjunct that was found in the novel “The Witness”. This study analyzed the phrase form of manner adjuncts. Those are manner adjunct in the form of adverb phrase. The manner adjunct in the form of adverb phrase occured in the initial, medial and final position. Manner adjunct in the form of prepositional phrase was analyzed in this study. They were in the initial position and end position while it occured in the medial position. The theory of Quirk et al (1985), Swan (1996), and Leech (1975), Deterding and Gloria (2001) and Hornby (2005) were used in this study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The second research study was from Rathadi (2009) in his undergraduate thesis entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Analysis of Adverb of Degree in Charlotte’s Web Novel”</span><span class="font2"> describing the position of adverb degree in sentence structure. Actually, there were two problems to be discussed in his research study. The first was to analyze the position of adverb of degree found in sentence structure. The second was to analyze the form and function of adverb of degree found in sentence structure. Relating two sentences to become a unit of sentence were used by some adverbs. The theory of Eckersley (1965) describing about adverb of degree to what extent was used in this study. The theory of Huddleston (1984), Thomas and Martinet (1986) were used in the writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The third undergraduate thesis entitled “Adverbs and its Syntactic Function with Special reference to Danielle Steel’s Daddy” written by Nuryanti (2007). This study analyzed about the types of adverb found in the novel. This study found that there were three position of adverb which found in the novel. This study used the theory of Huddleston (1984) in his book entitled</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Introduction to the Grammar of English.</span><span class="font2"> Secondly, this study used the theory of Quirk (1972) entitled a University Grammar of English. This study applied the theory of Swan (1996) entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Practical English Usage.</span><span class="font2"> The weakness of this undergraduate thesis was that this study described about adverb in general and the relation between the problem and the theory used by the writer is inappropriate. The strength of this was on the application on the syntactic function to the data. The writer chose this undergraduate thesis as one of the review because it related to the topic of adverb of manner.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The novel entitled “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Wonderful Wizard of Oz</span><span class="font2">” was used as the data source as there were many data of adverb of manners which were found in the data source. The data were collected through reading the entire data in the novel entitled “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Wonderful Wizard of Oz</span><span class="font2">” in order to get the data of adverb of manner. The parts of research method included data source, method and technique of collecting data and method and technique of analyzing data. The data sources and method and technique of collecting data were the procedures that were used to get certain objects. It also explained the data taken from the sources and how to analyze it. The research was done in the field of observation. The research was done by taking data source containing adverb of manner that were found in the data source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In analyzing data of adverb of manner, this research study applied qualitative method. First, the collected data were then analyzed descriptively. Adverb of manner was classified and analyzed, based on the forms and positions. The form and position of adverb of manner were analyzed by using the theory proposed by Brown and Miller (1991). The forms of adverb of manner were analyzed by using the tree diagram. The position of adverb of manner were then explained based on the theory proposed by Quirk and Greenbaum (1973).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brown and Miller (1992:95) stated that adverbs of manner are the items that most readily spring to mind as examples of the class adverb, especially those formed by the –ly suffix to a corresponding adjective form:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy ----------------» happily &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Brown and Miller, 1991:95)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicious -----------------k viciously &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Brown and Miller, 1991:95)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In the prepositional phrase, the form of adverb of manner is characterized by the preposition as the head of adverb of manner. Adverb of manner is positioned in the initial position, medial position and final position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brown and Miller (1992:94) stated that, adverbs of manner are typically a prepositional phrase as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. The man beat the dog </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in a vicious manner</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Brown and Miller, 1991:94)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. The man beat the dog </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">with apparent enjoyment</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Brown and Miller, 1991:94)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. John stood on his head </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">with difficulty</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Brown and Miller, 1991:94)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">The forms and position of adverb of manner were analyzed by using the tree diagram. The form of adverb of manner is an adejctive followed by –ly suffix and it was analyzed by using tree diagram. It can be seen below, here are the data of adverb of manner and the analysis of them in tree diagram.</span></p>
