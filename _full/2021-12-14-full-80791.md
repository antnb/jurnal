<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract*</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">This research is entitled &quot;The Linguistic Phenomenon Found in the Instagram Caption Account of the @bahasa_Bali&quot; which aims to find the code mixing and code switching for the linguistic phenomenon contained in the Instagram caption of the @bahasa_bali account. The data collected was analyzed descriptively using qualitative methods in the Instagram caption of the @bahasa_bali account. The data in the form of code switching and code mixing in the speech found on the caption are analyzed for the function of the speech act using Searle's version of speech act theory which divides speech acts into three namely locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that the form of code switching and code mixing in the speech contained in the Instagram @bahasa_bali caption is in the form of words and phrases. The speech acts of code switching and code mixing are in the form of locutionary and illocutionary speech acts which have assertive, directive, and expressive functions. The factors in the use of code switching in speech are because Balinese language which is the main language has not been able to provide equivalent words that are in accordance with the intentions of the speaker and speech partner. The factors that influence the use of code mixing in everyday speech are both speakers and speech partners who both master Balinese, Bahasa and English so that there is contact between the three languages both national languages, regional, and foreign in a communication.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">In a multicultural and multilingual society, the use of more than one language when communicating is a common linguistic phenomenon. Mastery of more than one language requires a person to choose the language to be used. There is a tendency to expand knowledge and insight, encouraging the global community to compete to maximize their potential, especially in mastering language. This resulted also developing phenomenon language contact are no longer limited to the national language and regional languages, but also between the national language with a foreign language, the local language with a foreign language, even contact between the three languages both national languages, regional, and foreign in a communication. This event can then lead to code switching and code mixing. Code switching is one aspect of language dependence in a bilingual or multilingual society. That is, in a bilingual or multilingual society, it is very possible for a speaker to use various codes in his speech acts according to the situation and various aspects that surround it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Rokhman (2013) asserts that in a multilingual society it is almost impossible for someone to use one language absolutely without using another language or elements of another language because between one language and another language has a dependency in a multilingual society. Discussions about code switching are always followed by discussions about code mixing. Code switching includes a model of speaking style which is one aspect of language dependence in a multicultural and multilingual society. It is a fact that in such a society it is almost impossible for a speaker to use one language without the slightest use of other languages or elements of language. According to Richard et.al. (1985), code switching is a transition from the use of one language to another. Code switching can occur when a speaker uses one language and the interlocutor answers in another language. A speaker speaks one language and then switches to using another language in the middle of the conversation, or even in the middle of a sentence. According to Nababan (1991), the concept of code switching also includes events when a speaker switches from one language variety to another or from one dialect to another. From the opinions above, it can be concluded that code switching is a symptom of a transition from one language to another, from one variation to another, or it can also be a transition from one variety to another. While code mixing according to Chaer and Agustina (2010) explains that in code mixing there is a main code or basic code that is used and has its functions and autonomy, while the other codes involved in the event are only in the form of pieces, without a function or autonomy as a code of a speaker, for example in Indonesian, many slips of foreign language fragments such as English or regional languages. It can be said to have mixed code. It can be</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">concluded that code mixing is an event of using two or more languages in a communication by including fragments or elements of another language because there are some words or terms that cannot be conveyed so that it requires the use of regional/foreign languages or varieties. Code mixing is the use of one language by consistently inserting language elements that insert into other languages. Kridalaksana (2001) translates code mixing as (1) interference, (2) the use of language units from one language to another to expand language style or language variety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The phenomenon of code switching and code mixing can occur both in non-formal language situations, for example in everyday conversations and in formal situations. The phenomenon of code switching and code mixing can also be found in Instagram captions such as the phenomenon of code switching and code mixing found on caption of the Instagram account @bahasa_Bali. Instagram caption is a way for users to describe the intent or explanation in writing about content in the form of photo or video content. Instagram account @bahasa_Bali is an educational Instagram account that focuses on learning Balinese language and script. This account has been around since 2017 until now and is actively creating content about Balinese language, script and culture. Based on initial observations, the Instagram account @bahasa_bali was followed by 6,729 followers from various backgrounds, including age, social, culture, region, and various languages. so that it is very possible for code switching and code mixing to occur in the caption used by admin of the @bahasa_bali Instagram account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Code switching and code-mixing already thrives in Indonesia in line with the times. In fact, the phenomenon of code switching has become a trend among the speaker community today. The phenomenon of code switching and code mixing has become so widespread that this phenomenon has turned into language behaviour. From the explanation above, this research will discuss about how the form of code switching and code mixing is in the @bahasa_bali Instagram caption and how the speech act functions in the use of code switching and code mixing in the @bahasa_bali Instagram caption.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Methods</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">According to Mukhtar (2013) qualitative descriptive research method is a method used by researchers to find knowledge or theory of research at a certain time. According to Nazir (2014) descriptive method is a method in examining the status of a group of people, an object, a condition, a system of thought, or a class of events in the present. The purpose of this descriptive</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">89 </span><span class="font11">research is to make a systematic, factual and accurate description, picture or painting of the facts,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">characteristics and relationships between the phenomena under investigation. Nazir (2014). Therefore, the method used in this research is descriptive qualitative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The data collected was analyzed descriptively using qualitative methods about code switching and code mixing in the speech contained in the Instagram caption of the @bahasa_bali account. The data in the form of code switching and code mixing in the speech found on the caption are analyzed for the function of the speech act using Searle's version of speech act theory which divides speech acts into three namely locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary (Searle, 1969). The perlocutionary act is an act of growing influence (effect) on the speech partner. This speech act is called the act of affecting someone. Illocutionary acts are acts of doing something with a specific purpose and function. This speech act can be said as the act of doing something.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions</span></h4></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">From the research, the main language used by the @bahasa_bali account is Balinese. This happens because the @bahasa_bali instagram account focuses on educating its followers about Balinese language, literature and culture. The linguistic phenomena found in the speech on caption are code switching and code mixing. The form of code switching and code-mixing found on caption of @bahasa_bali is as follow:</span></p>
