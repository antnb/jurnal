There have been many studies about the dryer with a static bed so dry material produced is not uniform Thus drying withrotating bed can produce the dry material uniformly Usually a prototype closest to the efficiency of the system as aperformance but it has not been able to show its thermal energy balance So the target of this research is a transient thermalenergy balance Data taken in the testing include the temperature inlet fluid of drying chamber channel
