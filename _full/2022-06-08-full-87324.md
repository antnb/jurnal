<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Background</span><span class="font2">: Inflammation is a natural body response, but when it reaches the systemic chronic inflammation stage, it can cause more dangerous complications. Many natural ingredients have been developed as anti-inflammatory agents. One of them is sirih bumi (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Peperomia pellucida</span><span class="font2"> [L.] Kunth). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Objective</span><span class="font2">: This study aims to summarize and examine the research results related to the anti-inflammatory activity of the sirih bumi. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Methods</span><span class="font2">: Research articles were collected from various online databases such as Google Scholar, Google, Medline, Pubmed, and Science Direct. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to obtain original research articles relevant to the desired topic, published in the last ten years, the full text was accessible, and the research methods and results were well explained and valid. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Results</span><span class="font2">: In total, only six articles are eligible to be discussed. The research was conducted in Indonesia, Nigeria, and Malaysia. In vitro and in vivo methods with various models and parameters were used to test the anti-inflammatory activity. All parts of the plant are proven to have anti-inflammatory effects that can be presented in extracts or herbal teas. The activity of sirih bumi is determined by the dose or concentration of administration, processing process, and harvest time. The combination with other samples must be reconsidered to maintain the desired anti-inflammatory effect. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span><span class="font2">: Antiinflammatory activity of sirih bumi has been proven through various studies. The development of the sirih bumi product is expected to help handle inflammation and other diseases related to inflammation.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Inflammation is normal because it is the body's natural response to defend against infection and injury. However, inflammation still needs particular attention, especially if it has reached the stage of chronic systemic inflammation. This condition can induce and exacerbate various diseases such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases. When it reaches this stage, disability and even death can</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">occur<sup>[1,2]</sup>. Therefore, potential agents are needed to cure or prevent inflammation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many drugs have been developed to treat inflammatory conditions. Currently, the community uses both modern medicines and traditional herbal medicines. Many plants have been studied to treat inflammation. One of the plants that have the potential for efficacy and economics is sirih bumi (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Peperomia pellucida</span><span class="font2"> [L.] Kunth).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sirih bumi has not been widely cultivated so it is only considered as a </span><span class="font1">39</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">weed. This plant is known to have many pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory<sup>[3–9]</sup>. This article summarizes and discusses the latest research developments related to sirih bumi as an anti-inflammatory agent.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>METHODS</span></h2>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Search and Identification Stage</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Google Scholar and four other electronic databases, such as Pubmed and Science Direct, were used as search engines. The search process was carried out until the end of May 2022. The search keywords used were &quot;peperomia pellucida&quot;, &quot;inflammatory&quot;, &quot;cytokine&quot;, &quot;edema&quot;, and the word in the Indonesian version.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Eligibility Selection</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The first stage is the identification stage. The author searches for related articles online using predefined keywords. The title and abstract of the original article were assessed according to keywords. The second step is to filter the abstracts from the articles obtained. Only articles with abstracts that meet the specified eligibility criteria are then downloaded in their</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">entirety for the third stage, which is to determine the eligibility criteria in terms of content.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The inclusion criteria in this study were original research in original articles published in the last ten years. The type of research is not limited. If the article meets all the inclusion criteria, but the test results are not clearly reported, and the text cannot be accessed entirely and free of charge, the article will be excluded.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Six research articles that matched the search criteria and were available in the full text were analyzed further. The data that has been summarized are presented in table 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many studies have been carried out on the anti-inflammatory activity of the sirih bumi. In the last ten years, six related studies have been found. Research with sirih bumi seems to still interest to researchers today. This can be seen from the number of publications in the last two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Table 1 shows that Indonesia is the country that has carried out the most research. This is probably due to the abundance of sirih bumi that can grow in Indonesia throughout the year. Research into the cultivation of this plant has been carried out to obtain better results than just taking it from the wild <sup>[15]</sup>. In Indonesia, as a tropical country, many sirih bumi grow well in yards, rocky areas, and rice fields so that large-scale cultivation is relatively easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The type of research carried out is mostly in vitro studies. This is likely due to efficiency in time, cost, and the number</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of samples that must be used. However, not a few in vivo studies have been carried out. Previously in 2004, the ethanolic extract of the sirih bumi was found to significantly reduce the volume of the foot paw and the number of leukocytes in an experiment using rats<sup>[16]</sup>. Moreover, in 2010, petroleum ether extract significantly reduced carrageenan-induced hind paw edema<sup>[17]</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Various types of samples from the sirih bumi plant have been tested. It has been tested in the form of extracts and in the form of herbal teas that are ready to be consumed. The type of extract tested in the last ten years is classified as a type of extract that tends to be polar and semipolar. However, the non-polar extract was tested in the previous years and proved to be effective<sup>[17]</sup>. The anti-inflammatory effect is not only shown by certain plant parts but all parts of the plant have also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In a study conducted by Sulistiyani et al. (2012), sirih bumi extract was proven to inhibit the cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme in vitro. At a 100 g/mL concentration, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">inhibitory power was 47.5%. This activity is even better than red ginger extract. When the two extracts were combined, the activity decreased. This finding indicates that there is antagonism between the two extracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The activity of sirih bumi has also been proven in vivo through research by Barung et al. (2012). Sirih bumi herb infusion at a concentration of 30% has been shown to have the ability equivalent to a standard drug, phenylbutazone, at a dose of 5.04 mg/200 g BW rats in reducing the volume of rat paw edema. Increasing the concentration of sirih bumi to 60% can increase the anti-inflammatory effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sirih bumi's ability to inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines also contributes to its anti-inflammatory activity. In the study of Salim et al. (2014), sirih bumi extract at a concentration of 5 μg/mL was able to inhibit the release of TNF-α (3.9 ± 0.8), IL-1α (29.5 ± 2.31%), IL-1β (18.5 ± 5.4%), IL-6 (19.6 ± 1.2%), and IL-8 (6.4 ± 1.0%) that involved in inducing acute inflammation. However, this activity was lower than the standard dexamethasone and andrographolide at the same concentration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the fourth article, sirih bumi was proven to reduce the number of PMN (polymorphonuclear) cells in experiments using rats. The number of PMN cells in the post-extraction tooth socket area decreased with the administration of both ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts. The inflammatory process that proceeds faster is thought to accelerate the recruitment of bone cells so that post-extraction tooth socket healing can run faster than the duration of healing through normal physiological processes<sup>[9]</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Drying the stems and leaves of the sirih bumi did not eliminate its antiinflammatory effect. This phenomenon is founded on the study of Fakayode et al. (2021), who tested anti-inflammatory activity through membrane stabilization and inhibition of protein denaturation. The anti-inflammatory activity was more</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">excellent in the dry sample extract than in the fresh sample extract at the same concentration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Experiments conducted by Ng et al. (2021) using the herbal tea of sirih bumi recommended the best drying process to optimize the anti-inflammatory effect of freeze-drying for unfermented and fully fermented sirih bumi products. As for the partially fermented sirih bumi, it is better to use hot air-dried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The anti-inflammatory activity of sirih bumi is affected by the drying process and the time of harvest. Especially for the sirih bumi plant grown in subtropical countries, the optimum anti-inflammatory effect was found in plants harvested during phenophases 1 and 2 of winter and spring<sup>[18]</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The anti-inflammatory activity of sirih bumi is thought to come from dillapiol compounds. Dillapiol was found to have moderate antiphlogistic properties, so it can be used as a prototype for newer antiinflammatory compounds. This activity is thought to be caused by the presence of the benzodioxole ring and alkyl groups in the side chain and the methoxy groups in the aromatic ring<sup>[19]</sup>. Compounds with a similar structure in the sirih bumi may also be responsible for the emergence of antiinflammatory activity in the sirih bumi.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Anti-inflammatory activity of sirih bumi has been tested in various countries, including Indonesia. In the last ten years, there have been six related studies published. The anti-inflammatory activity was tested both in vitro and in vitro using various products from sirih bumi. Sirih bumi is proven to have an antiinflammatory effect determined by the dose or concentration of administration, processing process, and harvest time. The combination with other samples needs to be reconsidered to maintain the desired anti-inflammatory effect of sirih bumi.</span></p>
