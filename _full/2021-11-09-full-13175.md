<p><span class="font5">This study aims to determine the effect of perceptions of distributive, procedural and interactional justice on post-service recovery satisfaction and post-service recovery satisfaction effect on the intention to revisit and WOM recommendations of foreign tourists to Bali. The respondents of this study were foreign tourists who visited Bali and ever experienced complaint. The number of eligible samples was 100 respondents. The questionnaire was given to tourists visiting tourist attractions of Tanah Lot, Kintamani and Besakih. Data were analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis, namely structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of this study indicated that the perception of distributive justice, procedural and interactional had a positive and significant effect on the post-service recovery satisfaction of foreign tourists who visited Bali. The study also found a positive and significant effect of post-service recovery satisfaction on the intention to revisit and the intention of recommending positive WOM of foreign tourists who visited Bali.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Introduction</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Background</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Various attempts were made by service providers to maintain and increase repeat visits of tourists to a tourist destination, such as improving the quality of service so that customers become satisfied. If consumers get a satisfactory experience, then this may lead to re-purchase behavior and recommend the experience to others. Engel et al (1995: 210 in Badawi, 2012) state that consumer satisfaction is an evaluation of various alternative options provided by service providers, at least meeting or exceeding customer expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The foregoing description can be interpreted that a customer will conduct an evaluation of his/her experience, whether his/her experience is in line with expectations or not. If the expectations of the customer are in accordance with the fact then he/she will feel satisfied. Conversely, if the expectations are not in accordance with reality, then the customer will feel discontent, which Oliver (1980) refers to it as disconfirmation. Expectation-disconfirmation model developed by Oliver (1980) is a concept that is used as a reference in the literature of marketing and manufacturing services to evaluate consumer behavior. Makens (2002) state that customer expectations are based on previous purchasing experience, even the opinion of friends and the promise of service providers. Further, it is</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">stated that it is very important for service providers to maintain and improve services that meet or even exceed customer expectations. Furthermore it is stated that satisfied customers will make repeat purchases, no matter with prices and become loyal customers (Makens, 2002).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dissatisfaction in some of the literatures is seen as a failure of the service (Wirtz and Mattila, 2004; Lovelock, 2007; Badawi, 2012). Among the behaviors complained of by Lovelock and Wirtz (2011) are due to the failure of the service, such as product returning, moving quietly, not wanting to buy another and providing negative information to others. The cause of the failure of the service according to Denham (1998 in Badawi, 2012), includes (1) failure caused by the company itself (40 percent), (2) the behavior of employees, such as being rude and unfriendly (20 percent), and (3) caused by the customer himself/herself (40 percent). By understanding the concepts contained in the marketing that the customer is everything, then attempt to do is revamping the company's internal problems and provide training on how to handle customers well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several studies have examined the service failure and recovery services such as Bell and Zemke (1987 in Badawi, 2012). Further there are five strategies that can be used to handle complaints, such as: (1) to apologize, (2) empathy, (3) award, (4) and (5) information on service failure and continued with presenting a prize. In line with the above opinion, Gautam (2011) in his study to identify strategies that can be used to restore the service as polite behavior (courtesy), honesty, providing explanations (offering explanations), empathy, endeavor, and an apology. Furthermore, Tax and Brown (1998 in Lovelock and Wirtz, 2011), state that nearly 85 percent of variations in service recovery satisfaction are determined by three dimensions of justice, namely procedural justice, interactional justice and distributive justice or the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Something that can be done by service providers to deal with complaints is to provide services quickly, to control the delay and flexibility (del Río-Lanza, Vázquez-Casielles and Díaz-Martín, 2009; Nikbin </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font5">, 2011). Service recovery can be done with service</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">recovery strategy based on interpersonal interaction in the delivery of services to consumers (Nikbin </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font5">, 2010; Gautam, 2011). Further, the speed of treatment is also one strategy for dealing with complaints. The study on service recovery was also carried out by Nikbin </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font5"> (2010), which examines complaints made by Iran Air flight. The study found a positive effect of distributive and interactional justice perceptions on service recovery satisfaction, influence perceptions of distributive justice is higher than the perceptions of interactional justice. Correspondingly, research conducted by Gautam (2011) also found the perception of distributive and interactional justice had an effect on recovery satisfaction of customer service in the aviation industry in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Research on satisfaction and service recovery has been done a lot, but there is still little research conducted on service recovery satisfaction in tourism destinations as well as the consequences of the continued behavior as a desire to repurchase and to have WOM information. Meanwhile, Nikbin </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font5"> (2010); Gautam (2011) only examine the influence of perceptions of fairness with service recovery satisfaction. The study on service failure was confirmed by the results of the research by Mostert </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">et al</span><span class="font5">. (2009) which suggested a link between service failure and service recovery efforts. This has an impact on satisfaction and dissatisfaction with air travelers. Dissatisfaction occurs because of a non-optimal service recovery effort that led to consumers reducing the frequency to fly back. This study used a social exchange theory (Homans, 1958), as the main theory and the theory of justice as an application theory. Social exchange theory is used to evaluate the service provider's response to customer complaints. Justice is the basis used to resolve conflicts between the customer and the service provider (Rawls, 2011; Pai, Yeh and Lin, 2012). Some researchers using the theory of justice were (Teo and Lim, 2001; Gautam, 2011; Pai, Yeh and Lin, 2012). Gautam (2011) used the theory of justice Rawls (2011) and equity theories to evaluate the service failure. Exchange implies that consumers expect compensation of costs incurred to acquire goods and services (Ghalandari, 2013). Furthermore, it is stated that there are three variables used to assess justice in the service</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">industry, namely: (1) the perception of distributive justice, (2) procedural justice, and (3) interactional justice (McCollough, Berry and Yadav, 2000; Kuenzel and Katsaris, 2009; Lovelock and Wirtz, 2011; Pai, Yeh and Lin, 2012).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Distributive justice implies that when there is a failure of service and consumer grievances, then the consumer is entitled to compensation, such as discounts and rewards by service providers. Compensation for consumers is a right which must be obtained and an obligation of service providers to give it. Associated with this research, tourism destination managers or stakeholders in the tourism business are obliged to give a sense of fairness in the handling of complaints. While procedural fairness is the flexibility and efficiency of the handling of complaints, such as the ease and speed of the so-called procedural fairness. Consumers want to get the ease when they have complaints and get treatment quickly. If the complaints are dealt with quickly, so consumers feel justice, on the contrary, if the complaint is not dealt with quickly, it is perceived as not getting justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, interactional justice is in the form of a complaint handling done in a friendly and thoughtful manner and there is an apology from the service provider, in the handling of complaints due to the failure of the service. Consumers will feel to get justice when there is an apology from service providers when dealing with complaints compared to not making an apology. The consequences of the grievance are the proposition in social exchange theory, namely the emergence of intention to make repeat purchases and reduce the negative WOM (Pai, Yeh and Lin, 2012). Pai, Yeh and Lin (2012) states that satisfaction after service recovery is an essential element in maintaining and expecting consumers’ repeat visit. Furthermore, they declare that distributive justice and interactional justice had a positive and significant effect on the post-service recovery satisfaction of customer that uses aviation services in Taiwan. This indicates that the higher the distributive and interactional justice in the handling of complaints, the higher the customer satisfaction and causes a desire to repurcase and reduce the negative WOM recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Associated with the study of post-service recovery, it was also conducted Nikbin </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">et al. </span><span class="font5">(2010), who examined the Iran Air flight industry. This study found a positive and significant influence perceptions of distributive and interactional justice on satisfaction of post-service recovery, and influence perceptions of distributive justice, higher than the perceptions of interactional justice. This is confirmed by research conducted Gautam (2011) who found that perceptions of distributive justice and interactional had an effect on post-service recovery satisfaction of customer in the aviation industry in India. To that end, this research seeks to explain the role of distributive justice, procedural justice and interactional justice in service recovery satisfaction and the role of service recovery satisfaction of the intention to revisit and WOM recommendations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Goodness of Fit Overall test results based on Table 1 indicated that 5 of the 7 criteria, namely p-value, TLI, CFI, CMIN / DF and RMSEA indicated good model. The best criteria used as an indication of goodness of a model is the value of Chi Square / DF which was less than 2, and RMSEA which was under 0, 08. In this study, the value CMIN / DF and RMSEA had met the cut-off value. Indicate that the structural model to test the causal relationship of justice constructs, post-service recovery satisfaction, intention to revisit, and WOM recommendations could be regarded as a good structural model. Thus SEM models in this research were suitable and feasible to be used, so that interpretation could be made for further discussion (Hair </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font5">, 1995; Widarjono, 2010).</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Based on Table 2 and Figure 1 is presented the results of testing the structural model as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perceptions of distributive justice have a positive and significant effect on the postservice recovery satisfaction with the significance at p = 0,000 (&lt; 0,05) and a coefficient of 0.386. This means that there is a significant effect between the perceptions of distributive justice on postservice recovery satisfaction. The coefficient being positive indicates that the relationship is directly proportional. This means that the higher perceptions of distributive justice, the post-service recovery satisfaction will also be higher. Conversely, the lower the perceived distributive justice is the lower the level of satisfaction after service recovery of tourists visiting Bali. Thus it can be stated that the hypothesis 1a is acceptable;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perception of procedural justice has a positive and significant effect on the postservice recovery satisfaction with a significance of p = 0, 028 (&lt; 0,05) and a coefficient of 0,187. This means that there is a significant effect between the perceptions of procedural justice on satisfaction post-service recovery. The coefficient being positive indicates that the relationship is directly proportional. This means that the higher the perception of procedural fairness, the post- service</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">recovery satisfaction will also be higher. Conversely the lower procedural justiceis then the lower the level of satisfaction after service recovery tourists visiting Bali. Therefore, hypothesis of 1b is acceptable;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perceptions of interactional justice has a positive and significant effect on post service recovery satisfaction with significance at p = 0, 000 (&lt; 0,05) with a coefficient of 0,365. This means that there is a significant effect between the perceptions of interactional justice on satisfaction of post-service recovery. The coefficient being positive indicates that the relationship is directly proportional. This means that the higher perceptions of interactional justice, the post-service recovery satisfaction will also be higher and vice versa. Thus, it can be stated that the hypothesis 1c is acceptable;</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-service recovery satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on intention to revisit with p = 0,011 (&lt; 0,05) with a coefficient of 0,665. This means that there is a significant effect between the postservice recovery satisfaction on the intention to revisit.The coefficient being positive indicates that the relationship is directly proportional. This means that the higher the post-recovery satisfaction of services the intention to revisit also will be higher. Conversely the lower the perceived satisfaction is then the lower the desire to come back. Thus, it can be stated that the hypothesis 2a is acceptable; and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-service recovery satisfaction has a positive and significant influence on the recommendation of WOM with p = 0,000 (&lt; 0,05) with a coefficient of 0,477. This means that there is a significant effect between the post-service recovery satisfactions on WOM recommendation. The coefficient being positive indicates that the relationship is directly proportional. This means that the higher the satisfaction of the service recovery after WOM recommendations will also be higher. In contrast the lower the postservice recovery satisfaction the lower the desire &nbsp;to &nbsp;provide a positive WOM</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">recommendation. Thus, it can be stated that the hypothesis 2b is acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Based on Table 1, 2 and Figure 1 and the results of the descriptive analysis based on the demographics of the respondents some of the findings of the complaint behavior of foreign tourists visiting Bali is still a reluctance of travelers to make a complaint directly (26 percent), this reinforces the results of research by Lovelock and Wirtz (2011) which states as much as 19 to 30 percent of customers are reluctant to make a complaint. This led to a situation that the complaint cannot be handled properly. The next finding of this study was in the form of a research model based on recovery services applied to tourism destinations. This finding is supported by the results of goodness of fit index qualified for fitness of model according to (Hair </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font5">, 1995).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The main findings of the study are: (1) the effect of perceptions of justice on satisfaction of post-services recovery which confirmed study of Kim, Kim and Kim (2009); Nikbin </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font5"> (2010); Gautam (2011), (2) the effect of procedural justice perceptions on the satisfaction of the service recovery which supported research Kim, Kim and Kim (2009); Nikbin </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font5"> (2010); Badawi (2012); Pai, Yeh and Lin (2012), (3) the effect of interactional justice on satisfaction after service recovery is consistent with the results of the study by Kim, Kim and Kim (2009); Nikbin </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font5"> (2010); Gautam (2011); Badaw, (2012); Pai, Yeh and Lin (2012), (4) Effect of service recovery satisfaction of the intention to revisit in line with the results of Kim, Kim and Kim (2009); Pai, Yeh and Lin (2012), (5) the effect of perceptions of justice to the WOM recommendations showed results consistent with the study of Kim, Kim and Kim (2009); Pai, Yeh and Lin (2012).</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Conclusion and Recommendation</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Conclusion</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">The perception of distributive justice has a positive and significant effect on the postservice recovery satisfaction. This means that the higher the perceptions of distributive justice, the post-recovery satisfaction service will also be higher and vice versa; the perception of procedural justice has a positive and significant effect on the post-service recovery satisfaction. This indicates that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">higher the perception of procedural fairness, the post-service recovery satisfaction will also be higher and vice versa;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The perception of interactional justice has a positive and significant effect on the postservic recovery satisfaction. It shows the higher perceptions of interactional justice; the post- service recovery satisfaction will also be higher and vice versa. Post-service recovery satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on intention to revisit. This means that the higher the satisfaction of post- service recovery then intention to revisit also will be higher as well and vice versa. Post-service recovery satisfaction has a positive and significant influence on the recommendation of WOM. To that end, this research found that the higher the indicator of satisfaction postservice recovery, the WOM Recommendations will also be higher and vice versa.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Recommendation</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">To increase tourist satisfaction during post-service recovery by government and tourism players, there is a need to apply marketing strategies based on tourism destination perceptions of distributive justice by providing compensation in the event of service failure. Applying procedural justice based strategy is to increase the speed of service in the event of service failure. Applying a recovery strategy based on services interactional justice is done by making an apology if there are failures of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To increase repeat visits and WOM recommendations to foreign tourists visiting Bali can be done by increasing the post-service recovery satisfaction. The strategies that can be used are as follows: (1) providing a good explanation to tourists when dealing with complaints, (2) handling complaints with a good attitude, such as greetings and expressing thanks, (3) providing adequate compensation based on the type of service failure, (4) dealing with complaints quickly so as to increase repeat visits and positive WOM. (5) Using mixed strategy of service recovery satisfaction to increase revisit and positive WOM recommendations.</span></p>
