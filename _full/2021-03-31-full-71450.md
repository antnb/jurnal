<p><span class="font1">Wirun tourism village, which covers an area of 265,500 ha, is an area that has its appeal in the creative industry with its strategic location which is located on the main transportation route and is traversed by bus routes that are widely used by people for transportation. There is alternative transportation in the form of Tourist Trains for the people to expand their reach but they are only able to pass by and overlook the area. The purpose of this study is to determine the process of participatory planning that has high acceptability if implemented. This is because all of the stakeholders are involved in every stage of planning policy formulation. The developed method aims to describe, explain and validate social phenomena as the object of the research by systematically creating descriptions, portrayals or paintings, as well as relationships between the observed phenomena and a process or relationship, providing a complete picture in either verbal or numerical form, presenting basic information of a relationship, creating a set of categories and classifying the research subjects. The results of this study are the concept of participatory planning in the development of the concept of reconstruction, adaptive revitalization in connecting tourist destinations with the gamelan creative industry through spatial and regional revitalization approaches.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The problems and challenges for tourism in Indonesia today are the lack of collaboration between the government and all stakeholders, including the role and the involvement of the community in developing tourist destinations. Some of the other issues in tourism development in Indonesia are the preservation of natural resources, the participation of the local communities,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">accessibility, and infrastructure in going to the destination. Another problem is that the destination as a tourist attraction is not based on a structured and documented planning concept according to official development documents. This often happens on site levels such as tourism villages and other development of tourist destinations. As such, support from various internal parties is needed, including the government, all stakeholders, and the community in de-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">veloping tourist destinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The existence of site-level destinations such as the Wirun tourism village, as one of the most well-known tourist villages in Sukoharjo, Central Java is because of the many tourism potentials the region has. The village, which is located in Mojolaban District, also has easy access to get to from Solo City and Karanganyar since it is only one kilometer away from Solo City, Wirun tourist village is a location visited by many local and international tourists. The tourism attraction is the fact that it is the center of the gamelan creative industry that has developed since the Dutch colonial rule. The products of the creative industry have become export commodities and many tourists visit to see how they are made and to order directly from the craftsmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Quoting from the opinion of several experts such as Totok Susanto (2016), the word gamelan as a creative industry comes from the Javanese word “gamel” which means hitting followed by the suffix “an” which indicates a noun. Gamelan is a collection of musical instruments that are played together which consist of Kendang, Bonang, Bonang Penerus, Demung,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Saron, Peking (Gamelan), Kenong &amp;&nbsp;Ket-huk, Slenthem, Gender, Gong, Gambang, Rebab, Siter, Suling. While the main ingredients in the gamelan are metal, wood, and leather. There is a ritual performed by gamelan-making experts before making the gamelan, the gamelan-making experts in question are the makers of gamelan made from metal, namely bronze in Wirun Village, Sukoharjo Regency. Several other potentials as developing tourist attractions are as shown in the Table 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The determination of Wirun village as a village that has an attraction for tourists to visit and become a tourist attraction lies on the Decree of the Regent as the level 2 regional head of Sukoharjo Region Number 556/460 / IV / 1993 which was issued on April 10, 1993, which recognized Wirun Village as an agricultural, arts and culture, as well as industrial tourism destination. This makes Wirun Village to be known by the surrounding communities, including tourists. The development from 1993 experienced a period of stagnation and did not develop at all, because it did not have any development concepts and documentation. Then in 2018 of a Decree from the Regent</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">of Sukoharjo number 414/787 of 2018 was issued, concerning the Designation of Wi-run Village, Mojolaban District as a Tourism Village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The stakeholders who played the most role in determining the tourism village were the Sukoharjo Regency Government, the Regional Development Planning Agency (Bappeda), the Sukoharjo Regency Tourism Office assisted by the Wirun village community as the recipient village of the policy. The development of the destination to become a tourist destination, including being attractive towards tourists, must meet 3 criteria, namely:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The three requirements above according to Oka (1996) are in line with the pattern of tourism marketing objectives in destinations so that more tourists come and stay longer in the destination. The Sukoharjo Regency Government realizes that efforts to develop a tourist village in Wirun village cannot be carried out by the government alone, instead, they need the support of the related parties.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/71450-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:207pt;height:60pt;">

<p><span class="font2">Source: Researcher’s documentation, 2020</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The realization of a tourist village with a creative gamelan industry has experienced obstacles and problems. The problem is the level of participation and the role of the community in the development of tourist villages in Wirun village is still low, currently being stagnant. These problems include a) the lack of socialization of tourism villages to the community which causes a lack of public knowledge about the importance of tourism. Socialization of potential attractions in Wirun tourist village, including the active role of the Tourism Awareness Group (Pokdarwis) is less than optimal, b) lack of understanding of the village community on the importance of tourism, c) accessibility problems, especially between modes of transportation in the form of a tourist train that crosses Wirun village. A stopping point for the tourist is needed, d) the main entrance to Wirun village is needed for clarity and characteristics, e) lack of involvement of stakeholders in the development of Wirun tourist village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a tourism village located in Mo-jolaban District, it has an important role as a liaison and recipient of the creative industry. Sukoharjo Regency includes large industries including textile and pharmaceutical industries, medium-sized industries including furniture, plastics, food/ beverage and garment industries, small in-</span></p>

The stopping point is a tourist route from the city point to the tourist village in the form of the main entrance for the tourist train line from Purwosari Station, Solo City to Wonogiri Regency. It is hoped that the route will be able to stop at the tourist village that previously existed but is now gone (demolished). It is hoped that these stopping points will facilitate the transportation route for tourists and make it easier to reach tourist destinations. As such, a participatory planning concept approach is needed in the revitalization of the area including developing the potential of the tourism village in the form of the Gamelan creative industry to become a growing and developing area, especially the resurrection of the village’s creative economy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">A spatial approach is a development approach aimed at managing spatial planning, both geographically, demographical-ly, and the village potential (Bintarto and Hadisumarno, 1991). To explore the tourism potential in Wirun village, the Wirun village government has taken a spatial approach as a guide to the basic framework for rural development and is a document that reflects the entire Wirun station master plan including developments in a rural area. This spatial approach also answers the problems and development demands needed by the village government and community in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The implementation of a Focus Group</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Discussion (FGD) with the stakeholders on participatory planning of the Tourist Train Station in Wirun village, it can be seen that development planning in Wirun village uses a bottom-up system, meaning that the planning process involves the entire community (Azwar, 1988). Proposals from the villagers can be submitted to the RT/RW, then it is discussed at a regular monthly meeting. The agreed-upon proposals are then brought to a village level meeting attended by representatives from the RT/RW, BPD, and village government.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/71450-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:207pt;height:163pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Participatory Approach.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The participatory approach is based on pre-planned development planning made by the village, involving elements from universities, local government, communities, media, and industry (Panca Helix). The University plays a role in mapping the potential and existing problems and assisting in community empowerment such as Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises, that are included in the creative industry. Local and village governments play a role in facilitating the development of tourism facilities and infrastructure, such as road infrastructure to provide accessibility. The industrial elements are working together in supporting the participatory planning of the tourist train station master plan. The role of the community, although still low in terms of participation, is to maintain the tourism environment so that it remains comfortable and safe to visit, and to increase environmental conservation so that it remains sustainable. The role of the mass media is to promote tourist objects and publishing tourism village activities to a wider audience so that the tourist village is increasingly known as the center of the creative industry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The theoretical concept according to Alberts and Brinda (2005) stated that revitalization is an effort to revitalize an area or part of an area that was once vital/alive, but which has undergone degradation. The revitalization approach must be able to recognize and take advantage of environmental potential from several aspects including historical value, area significance, location uniqueness, and the image of the area (Danisworo and Martokusumo, 2002). The participatory planning of the Wirun tourist train station is to restore the train station building that was lost due to the aging building materials.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/71450-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:203pt;height:104pt;">

<p><span class="font2">The sustainability of participatory planning and development of village potential is a sustainability program that is defined as the ability to maintain the function of the services that have been arranged in a program to continue functioning without any assistance from outside parties (Setyawan, Rahmi and Mitchell, 2000). Program sustainability is carried out continuously by emphasizing the active role of the community.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Planning carried out in a participatory manner is planning that is carried out through a deliberative development planning mechanism at the sub-districts, district/city level, as well as at the provincial level. Policies that are determined through a participatory process have high acceptability if implemented because all stakeholders are involved in every stage of planning policy formulation.</span></p>
