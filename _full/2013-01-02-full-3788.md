<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Jurusan Sastra Inggris Fakultas Sastra Unud ABSTRACT</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tulisan ini berjudul ”Analisis Kata penghubung yang diketemukan di dalam Novel” “Daughters of Moon Song” oleh Jessica Stuart. Karya tulis ini bertujuan untuk mengklasifikasikan dan menjelaskan jenis kata penghubung dan teks, serta maknanya. Data diambil dari novel “Daughters of Moon Song”oleh Jessica Stuart, kemudian dikumpulkan dengan metode dokumentasi dengan melakukan teknik pencatatan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Data dianalisis dengan menggunakan teori kata penghubung oleh Halliday dan Hasan (1976) untuk mengetahui jenis hubungan yang terjadi pada novel dalam bab satu dan paragraph utama. Hasilnya menunjukkan jenis kata penghubung dalam sumber data, yaitu: aditif, adversative, causal dan temporal, selain itu terdapat juga kata penghubung seperti kata continuatives. Dan juga menunjukkan bahwa ada arti dari setiap hubungannya yang terjadi dalam novel. Umumnya, penggunaan kata penghubung sangat menarik untuk hubungan antara unsur-unsur yang berkelanjutan dari teks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Kata Kunci : Cohesion, Conjunction, Additive, Adversative, Causal dan Temporal</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark1"></a>❖</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background of the study</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In our daily life we often read a text. It is in books, novels, magazine, newspapers, and other kinds of printed texts. Sometimes we are still confused about the text itself, whether or not is an understandable text, because we never now the texts are made, how the words are organized in order to make a meaningful text. Meanwhile, if we can understand the texts, we can justify that the texts are</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">meaningful. Meaningful texts, we can justify that the texts are meaningful. A sentence, which is related to other sentence in a text, will produce a good text.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">❖</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems of the study</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The analysis of writing focused on types, functions, and the occurrences of conjunction in the novel Daughters of Moon Song by Jessica Stuart. Based on background described above, there are three problems appearing in this study that can be formulated as follows :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What types of conjunctions are used in the novel</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">“</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Daughters Of Moon Song” by Jessica Stuart.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the function of those types of conjunction in the novel “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Daughters Of Moon Song” by Jessica Stuart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the types of conjunction that most frequently occur in the novel “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Daughters Of Moon Song “by Jessica Stuart.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">❖ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Aim of the Study</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Every study should have a certain aim. This study has two aims ;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigating the function conjunction used in the novel entitled.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Daughters Of Moon Song “by Jessica Stuart.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing the types of conjunction that found in the novel entitled.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Daughters Of Moon Song “by Jessica Stuart.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanings of conjunction used in the novel entitled.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Daughters Of Moon Song “by Jessica Stuart.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">❖</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scope of Discussion</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The discussion in this study was focused on the analysis of conjunction used in the novel </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Daughters of Moon Song” by Jessica Stuart.C</span><span class="font1">ohesion has many parts such as Reference, Conjunction, and so on. And it is easier to analyze based on the theory of Halliday. Therefore, Novel was used data collection entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Daughters Of Moon Song “by Jessica Stuart.</span><span class="font1"> Because in this novel.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark3"></a>❖</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical Framework</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The theoretical framework includes the theories of some discourse analysis. According to Halliday (1976:266), Conjunction is rather different in nature from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">other cohesive relation, from both reference, on the one hand, and substitution and ellipsis on the other. It is not simply an anaphoric relation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">❖</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methodology</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Methodology is a system or procedure that is used in order to examine certain objects. It is intended to give an idea of how to conduct the research which covers data source, data collection, and data analysis. Each item is explained more detail on the subtitle as follows.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark5"></a>❖</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Source</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Data source is the source from which data is obtained for the analysis in order to support the validity of the study. The data, which is used in this study as the abject of the analysis and discussion, was taken from one source, that is, a novel by Jessica Stuart entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Daughters of moon song”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark7"></a>❖</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Collection</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Data collection is the method used in collecting the data in accordance with the need of the study. The method applied in collecting the data is library research method. The data was collected from the novel which entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Daughters of moon song”</span><span class="font1"> by Jessica Stuart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">First, the text was read carefully. Then, note taking method was done; to classify the conjunction and to see the types of conjunctions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">❖</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Analysis</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The collected data was analyzed descriptively based on the theory of conjunction, proposed by Halliday and Hasan, In their book entitled Cohesion in English (1976). The analysis start to find conjunctions types of conjunctions used in the novel entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Daughters Of Moon Song” by Jessica Stuart.</span><span class="font1"> And then it is followed by analyzing how the conjunctions are presented.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">❖</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANALYSIS OF CONJUNCTION FOUND IN THE NOVEL</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“DAUGHTERS OF MOON SONG”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BY JESSICA STUART</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark9"></a>❖</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">This chapter presents the main point of discussion about the analysis of conjunction as part of cohesive relation study. The analysis is based on the concept of conjunction as part of the theory of cohesion proposed by Halliday and Hasan in cohesion in English (1976). The analysis tries to find out the types and function of conjunction that is used in the novel entitled “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">DAUGHTERS OF MOON SONG” by JESSICA STUART.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The analysis begins to find out the types of conjunction including additive, adversative, causal, and temporal, and the function of those types of conjunction and also the other continuative items that are commonly used in the novel.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark11"></a>❖</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additive</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In this type of conjunction, there are only two kinds of item which can be noted from the data source, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">and or.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">And</span><span class="font1"> (simple additive)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">When </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font1"> is used alone as a cohesive item, as distinct from and then, it often seems to have the sense of “there is something more to be said “or” an alternative interpretation “( Halliday and Hasan, 1976: 245). It can be seen clearly in the following example:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Like Romeo and Juliet,” she was fond of saying, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">and</span><span class="font1"> he would smile a trifle sadly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 04) In the seven examples above it is shown that the final sentence of each example do not modify any element in the first sentence. It merely adds further information to what as been mentioned in the previous sentence, a kind of discourse, which is linked by conjunction </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">and.</span><span class="font1"> Example (1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Or ( simple alternative additive )</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font1"> relation distinction between the external and the internal planes is perhaps more clear-cut in the basic meaning of which of the conjunctive </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font1"> relation is alternative. For example,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(9) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he had written, his letters had undoubtedly been confiscated by Lydia, she had not seen them, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font1"> heard from him since that fateful night.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 90)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Example (9), compares the opinion of the first speaker and the opinion of the second speaker.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark13"></a>❖ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Adversative</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">The core meaning of adversative relation is “contrary to expectation,” from the content what is being said (external) or from the communication process (internal).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, and yet. (simple adversative)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In general, the adversative conjunction </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">but</span><span class="font1"> is used in the novel while for conjunction </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">yet</span><span class="font1"> used four times. The example will be given below:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(12) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not exactly resent Raymond's choosing April, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">but she</span><span class="font1"> did not enjoy the out look that lay ahead for her.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 114) In the example above, the conjunction </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">but</span><span class="font1"> indicates special sense “in spite of.” This kind of conjunction can be paraphrased by a 'cohesive' subordinate clause introduced by though or although. In example (12)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only ( simple adversative relation)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The conjunction </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font1"> in the conjunctive relation is a part from simple adversative relation. Beside the conjunction only, the word </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">yet</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">although</span><span class="font1"> are simple adversative conjunction. For example,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(17) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It's impossible; surely you know that. Not </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font1"> am I against it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 78)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Data (17) only refers to another part of a sentence, it often goes in mid position with the verb</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark15"></a>❖ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Causal</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">In general the causal relation indicates the relation between sentences that express what follows is the result of as consequence of previous. The following discussion will include the items such as : so, for, because, and then.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. So (simple causal)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">So as simple expression of causal relation are used in the novel. The conjunction so of which the function is to introduce “a result” of what is stated previously. The example will be given below :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(19) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">So.</span><span class="font1"> your father was on more than friendly terms with Lydia Moon song.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 53) In data (19 ) the causal conjunction </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">so</span><span class="font1"> shows about someone to introduce a result of what is stated previously. In data (19) somebody explains about father was on more than friendly terms with Lydia Moon song.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. For and Because (reversed causal)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Within the sentence, it is natural to find the structural expression </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">because</span><span class="font1"> going in either direction. With the cohesive relation between sentences, how ever in the text unfolded is reflected in the typical sequence.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(21) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blamed her reaction on the pain she was suffering, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">for</span><span class="font1"> unconsciously she raised her knee and sharply brought it up hard between his thighs.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 133)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In example (21) the conjunction </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font1"> means ' this is why the speaker asking.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">❖ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Temporal</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The temporal relation occurs when the sequence of events in sentences are related in terms of time; the one is subsequent to the other. This relation is expressed externally by its simplest form then. The other temporal expression such as : (and) then and finally.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then and (and) then (simple sequential) The examples of item will be given below:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(26) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she let him kiss her again, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">then</span><span class="font1"> gently eased him away and glanced around.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 85) As mentioned before, the conjunctive item then connects the sentences which are related in time. It can be seen from all the examples above that this conjunctive item relates the two which the second sentence which can be interpreted to occur after the first event.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally (conclusive relation)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The expression of </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">finally</span><span class="font1"> is used to indicate the conclusive sense, which means 'lastly; to conclude'. (Halliday and Hasan, 1976 : 265 ). Example :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(31) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”Yes . I've </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">finally</span><span class="font1"> succeeded.” He said. He handed her the vial. “Moon song,” he announced dramatically.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 88)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(32) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seemed to be led through dozens of rooms, along miles of corridors, up a raft of staircases only to descend others; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">finally </span><span class="font1">they stood before two huge bronze and copper doors, elaborately carved in a profusion of shapes and forms.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 310)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Finally</span><span class="font1"> here indicates the meaning of 'the end of some process of series of process. In example (31) shows that' after he handed her the vial. “Moon song” he announced dramatically, then stop their imagination with her question. While in example (32) shows that, they seemed to be led through dozens of rooms, along miles of corridors, up a raft of staircases so they stood before two huge bronze and copper doors, elaborately carved in a profusion of shapes and formsz</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">❖ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Analysis of Other Conjunctive Items (Continuatives)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The continuatives found in the novel include, now, of course, well, surely, which are going to be discussed in the following part.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The continuative now signals and means ‘the opening of a new stage in the communication'. It could be as a new situation in the story. A new role or attitude or a new point in the argument. (Halliday and Hasan, 1976 : 268 ).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For example;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(35) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps one day, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">now</span><span class="font1"> that she had the money to afford it, she would return to China and bring home the son she'd been forced to abandon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 18)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(36) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Balclutha will take it tomorrow. She threw down the report. “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Now,</span><span class="font1"> what's Morris biting his nails about?” “The Nez!”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 19) In the first example (35), </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">now</span><span class="font1"> indicates the meaning of a new situation in the story. While in the second example (36), it signals the meaning of a new point in the argument, it explains the previous sentence more clearly in the next sentence by adding a new argument.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Well means “I knowledge the question, and will give a considered answer,” it indicates that what follow is in fact response to what has preceded (Halliday and Hasan, 1976:269). Example this item will be given below:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(39) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Well”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">He smiled sheepishly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">( Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 80)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(40) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well,</span><span class="font1"> yes,” Lydia said a bit self-consciously.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 189) Both of the examples, shows that well usually occurs at the beginning of a response in dialogue. The example indicate the follow up a response of he paused and then said, ”I suppose you are wondering why I am here, c. Of course</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This means 'you should have know that already'. It is typically used, therefore, to disarm someone into accepting something the speaker knows he is likely to reject.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(44) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never wanted to see Peter Mac Nair again and why she'd purchased a mansion within a stone's throw of his she did not</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">know. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">of course</span><span class="font1"> Nob Hill, she'd reasoned, was convenient and it did represent the epitome of success and respectability, in San Francisco, a respectability she had coveted greatly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 18)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(45) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Soon, my darling. I will have to make arrangements, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">of course,</span><span class="font1"> and we will have to be sensible and make plants.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 09) Based on example (44,46), the meaning of continuative </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of course</span><span class="font1"> is 'I accept the fact' and the meaning of continuative of course in example (45) is 'you must accept the fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">d. Surely</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The preposition being enunciated, is not cohesive, except in the Cataphoric sense that a question is cohesive, it demands an answer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(48) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But darn, April, you told me that Father knew you and liked you. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Surely</span><span class="font1"> he'd not object to us.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 10)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(49) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I told you how she let everyone think I was her servant because she was ashamed of me.” “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Surely</span><span class="font1"> she had her reasons?”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">(Jessica Stuart, 1981 : 11) The continuative surely the examples, show that is to invite the hearer to assent to the preposition being enunciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This test works well with Additive, Adversative. Causal and Temporal relation, however, this test will arise problem with additive since there is possible to insert, for example and, between almost any pair of independent sentences in the texts.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark17"></a>❖ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">From analyzing the analysis of writing focused on types, functions, and the occurrences of conjunction in the novel “</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Daughters Of Moon Song”</span><span class="font1"> by Jessica</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Stuart, there are three problems appearing in this study that can be formulated as the answer to problems of this study.</span></p>
