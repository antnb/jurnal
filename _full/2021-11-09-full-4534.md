Objectives To determine 5174 kDa adhesin of Bifidobacterium sp cell wall isolated from infants feces as an anti adhesion of E coli on enterocyte mice Methods Randomized PosttestOnly Control Group Design was employed to investigate adherence ability of this adhesin towards Ecoli adhesion on mice entherocyte Results In this research it was obtained that the 5174 kDa adhesin cell wall of Bifidobacterium sp has an ability to inhibit adhesion of E coli on m
