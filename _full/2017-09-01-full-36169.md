Endophytic bacteria are the bacteria that live in plant tissues In oil palm tissue there are many types of endophytic bacteria and have a role that can be beneficial for the plant one of them is endophytic Bacillus sp The aim of these research was to obtain morphology physiology and molecular characteristics of endophytic Bacillus sp originating from oil palm tissue Sampling was done by random simple sampling method Isolation of bacteria was performed on pla
