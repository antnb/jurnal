<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Abstract</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This study seeks to explore the influence of certain factors, namely company growth, interest coverage ratio, and fixed asset intensity, on a company's financial health or distress. We pay special attention to the potential role of CEO overconfidence as a variable that might change or moderate these influences. Drawing from a quantitative approach, we used publicly available financial statements of primary consumer goods companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2017 to 2021. Our findings suggest that company growth and the value of fixed assets play roles in determining financial distress, but the interest coverage ratio does not. Moreover, when factoring in CEO overconfidence, we found it changes the way company growth and fixed assets relate to financial distress. Yet, this CEO trait doesn’t alter the relationship between the interest coverage ratio and financial distress.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">As reported by CNN Indonesia in 2020, Matahari Department Store initiated the permanent shutdown of 25 outlets dispersed across Indonesia. This decision stems from the store's declining financial health. Specifically, in 2020, the store's gross sales stood at 8.59 trillion Rupiah, marking a sharp decline of 52.3% from its 2019 figures, which amounted to 18.03 trillion Rupiah. Consequently, the company registered a substantial loss of 823 billion Rupiah in 2020, a stark contrast to its 2019 net profit of 1.36 trillion Rupiah. A similar course of action was taken by PT. Hero Supermarket Tbk, prompted by continuous financial losses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This research is anchored on discrepancies observed in extant literature.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Prasetya &amp;&nbsp;Oktavianna (2021) </span></a><span class="font5">posited that company growth negatively influences financial difficulties, a stance corroborated by studies from</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Amanda &amp;&nbsp;Tasman (2019) </span></a><span class="font5">and</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Widhiari &amp;&nbsp;Merkusiwati</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(2015).</span></a><span class="font5"> Conversely, a study by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Muzharoatiningsih &amp;&nbsp;Hartono (2022)</span></a><span class="font5"> indicated that company growth doesn't significantly affect financial distress, a conclusion mirroring the findings of</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Saputra &amp;&nbsp;Salim (2020).</span></a><span class="font5"> When evaluating the impact of the interest coverage ratio on financial distress,</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Meryana &amp;&nbsp;Setiany (2021) </span></a><span class="font5">contend that the ratio significantly influences financial distress, a sentiment echoed by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Hanafi et al.

<p><span class="font5">This study presents findings divergent from those of</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Ananda et al. (2022),</span></a><span class="font5"> which posited that the interest coverage ratio lacks a significant effect on financial distress. Clearly, there exists an inconsistency in addressing the impact of the interest coverage ratio on financial distress across studies.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Damajanti et al. (2021) </span></a><span class="font5">emphasize that employing a company's total assets to harness profits from sales and investment activities can bolster its resilience against financial distress, a sentiment echoed by</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Akmalia (2020)</span></a><span class="font5"> and</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Hai et al.

<p><span class="font5">In this research, CEO overconfidence is introduced as a moderating variable. Decision-making trajectories set by CEOs, especially those exhibiting excessive selfconfidence, might entail bold strategies, capitalizing on available opportunities. This research's uniqueness stems from its focus on company growth, interest coverage ratio, and fixed asset intensity as independent variables, with CEO overconfidence serving as a moderating agent. Given that myriad factors could precipitate a company into financial distress, strategic finesse becomes imperative to forestall financial challenges.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Ghayour</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">et al. (2022) </span></a><span class="font5">underscore that CEO decisions can amplify ties with financial distress. Corporate strategies are thus pivotal for sustaining a company's fiscal health. This investigation zeroes in on variables that either attenuate or amplify the determinants of financial distress, aiming to offer actionable insights for corporate decision-making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Contrasting conclusions from prior studies underscore the need for this research, which seeks to advance our understanding of the determinants of financial distress. Here, we expand the study's scope concerning its population, temporal span, and variables, particularly emphasizing CEO Overconfidence's moderating role in the relationship between the interest coverage ratio, company growth, fixed asset intensity, and financial distress.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Jensen &amp;&nbsp;Meckling (1976) </span></a><span class="font5">define agency relationships as contracts between a principal and an agent, whereby the latter receives decision-making authority.</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Brigham &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Daves (2007) </span></a><span class="font5">concur, suggesting that agency relationships emerge when a principal, typically a company owner, delegates decision-making authority to managers. Challenges in this dynamic often arise from misaligned expectations and outcomes, as well as potential conflicts with creditors. These conflicts often pivot on individualistic pursuits. For instance, agents might seek to optimize strategies around investments or borrowed funds, possibly leading to discord with principals. Principals, in contrast, often desire continuously increasing operational profits without proportional hikes in corporate expenditure </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Pearce &amp;&nbsp;Robinson, 2008)</span></a><span class="font5">. In the throes of financial distress, agency theory postulates heightened conflicts between companies and their creditors.

<p><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Hery (2015) </span></a><span class="font5">asserts that company growth serves as an indicator of its success. A rising sales growth ratio suggests that the company is meeting its targets with an escalating percentage of sales year over year.

<p><span class="font5">Information on a company's financial standing is pivotal for evaluating its capability to secure financing or other fiscal resources. Factors influencing this status include the management of financial resources, financial structure, liquidity, solvency, and adaptability to diverse changes </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Ramadhan &amp;&nbsp;Marindah, 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">.

<p><span class="font5">The variable of CEO Overconfidence can be quantified through several metrics, such as the propensity of CEOs to invest aggressively in innovation. CEOs exhibiting overconfidence often have a higher probability of realizing profits vis-à-vis developmental costs. This inclination can augment company value and mitigate associated risks </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Sumunar</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">&amp;&nbsp;Djakman, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">.

The CEO's role is pivotal in steering the trajectory of company growth. Such leaders persistently devise strategies to foster positive growth trajectories, thereby mitigating financial distress scenarios. In this context, overconfident CEOs can amplify the influence of company growth on financial distress, as their overarching goal remains to elevate reputation and operational performance, surpassing industry counterparts </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Nurcahyani &amp;&nbsp;Rahmawati, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In strategizing financial pathways, overconfident CEOs often exhibit a preference for external financing to bolster the company's capital. They harbor the aspiration that operational profits will suffice to service both the principal and interest obligations. Consequently, this can escalate interest expenses, amplifying the company's financial burden and potentially leading to fiscal strain. Such a characteristic of CEO overconfidence might exacerbate financial distress. For investors, this becomes a salient consideration, given that a judicious debt structure can offer them assurance </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Yulianti &amp;&nbsp;Ramadhan,</span></a><span class="font5"> </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">2022)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The emphasis on fixed asset ownership within a company can be evaluated by the proportion of fixed assets to total assets. A preponderance of fixed assets implies higher concurrent depreciation expenses </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Hidayah &amp;&nbsp;Umiah, 2022)</span></a><span class="font5">. Overconfident CEOs may disproportionately channel the company's resources towards fixed assets, perceiving them as low-risk ventures </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Salsabila, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. Thus, CEO overconfidence can potentially diminish financial distress, rooted in the belief that adept asset management forestalls fiscal challenges </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Akmalia, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">H</span><span class="font1">7</span><span class="font5">: CEO overconfidence moderates and enhances the interplay between fixed asset intensity and financial distress.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">CEO Overconfidence has garnered notable attention in both academic research and corporate realms due to its influence on organizational decision-making. Highly overconfident CEOs may occasionally falter in timing and judgment, leading to erroneous decisions </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Kaplan et al., 2021)</span></a><span class="font5">. Investment and managerial decisions hinge on the CEO's self-assurance, necessitating scrutiny of their choices.

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Research Method</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This study employs a quantitative research approach, utilizing secondary data extracted from financial statements available on the Indonesia Stock Exchange website. It specifically examines financial statements from primary consumer goods sub-sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange between 2017 and 2021. These</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">statements have undergone audit processes and have been subsequently published. The study encompasses independent, moderating, and dependent variables. The independent variables are comprised of company growth, interest coverage ratio, and fixed asset intensity. CEO overconfidence serves as the moderating variable, while financial distress is the dependent variable. Due to specific inclusion criteria relating to the financial statements, not all companies within the primary consumer goods sub-sector registered between 2017 and 2021 are sampled. Non-random and purposive sampling techniques were employed. Key inclusion criteria were consistent listing during the study period, financial statement publication, documented losses or profit declines between 2017 and 2021, and availability of comprehensive data pertinent to the study. Based on these criteria, 27 primary consumer goods sub-sector companies were incorporated as study samples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Company growth serves as an evaluative metric for organizational success. Forecasts of company growth that transcend mere sales growth assumptions are more informative </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Krantz &amp;&nbsp;Johnson, 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. This is measured by comparing sales of the current year with those of the preceding year. The Interest Coverage Ratio, a tool that gauges a company's operational income potential to meet its interest obligations within a fiscal period (Bruner, 2004), is determined by contrasting earnings before interest and tax with interest expenses. Fixed assets, which are long-term investments subject to depreciation—with the exception of land—are integral to business operations </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Sugiono &amp;</span></a><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">Untung, 2016)</span></a><span class="font5">. Their intensity is gauged by the ratio of total fixed assets to total assets. Financial distress depicts a scenario where a company struggles financially, primarily due to inadequate cash flows to satisfy its financial commitments </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Altman, 1968)</span></a><span class="font5">. It is measured using the Altman Z-Score five-coefficient formula. The moderating variable, CEO Overconfidence, embodies five distinct characteristics </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Liang et al., 2020)</span></a><span class="font5">. These include gender, age, education level, academic program, term of office, and positional dualism. Each characteristic is assigned a binary value based on predetermined criteria. A cumulative score of four or above categorizes a CEO as overconfident.</span></p><img src="https://jurnal.harianregional.com/media/101079-2.png" alt="" style="width:449pt;height:219pt;">

<p><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5">Based on the descriptive statistical data presented in</span><a href="#bookmark11"><span class="font5"> Table 1,</span></a><span class="font5"> the study encompassed 135 company samples spanning the years 2017-2021. For the company growth variable, the data revealed a minimum value of -0.709 and a maximum value of 0.827, with a median of 0.016, a mean of 0.023, and a standard deviation of 0.224. The notable disparity between the growth of the smallest and largest companies indicates that the mean may not be a holistic representation of the dataset. The interest coverage ratio variable showcased a minimum value of -206.22 and a maximum value of 321.39. Its median was recorded at 1.075, its mean at 13.213, and the standard deviation was 53.447. Given the vast difference between the lowest and highest interest coverage ratios, the mean may not adequately encapsulate the entire dataset. For the fixed asset intensity variable, the minimum and maximum values were identified as 0.056 and 0.960, respectively. The median for this variable was 0.583, the mean was 0.595, and the standard deviation was 0.220. Notably, the standard deviation was smaller than the mean, suggesting that the mean can be a reliable representation for the entirety of the data. The financial distress variable displayed a minimum value of -3.952 and a maximum of 6.614. The median was found to be 1.354, the mean 1.401, and the standard deviation 1.569.

<p><span class="font5">reflect the entire data spectrum. It's noteworthy that the overall mean for financial distress stands at 1.4, implying that the collective sample for this study resides within a gray zone. This aligns with the observed trends for primary consumer goods sub-sector companies between 2017 and 2021. Nonetheless, the companies exhibited an average growth rate of 2.3% (0.023), which might be influenced by the fact that their cash flows are relatively smaller compared to their liabilities </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Nailufar et al., 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark12"><span class="font5">Table 2 </span></a><span class="font5">delineates the impact of company growth, interest coverage ratio, and fixed asset intensity on financial distress. The growth of the company has a negative influence on financial distress, evident from a computed value of 6.137, which surpasses the critical value of 1.977. Given its significance value of 0.00, which is less than the threshold of 0.05, the first hypothesis is consequently rejected. Growth is deemed favorable when it manifests consistently across periods and fosters increased revenue or profits </span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5">(Sanchiani &amp;&nbsp;Bernawati, 2018)</span></a><span class="font5">. The agency theory accentuates sales augmentation without adequately considering the consequent expenditures stemming from such growth. A disproportionately high expense-to-sales ratio is a primary factor contributing to dwindling company profits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The interest coverage ratio does not significantly impact financial distress. This is evident from its calculated value of 0.650, which falls below the benchmark of 1.977, and a significance value of 0.512, which exceeds the threshold of 0.05. Since the interest coverage ratio predominantly portrays the potency of profits in defraying interest costs, it does not holistically represent the overall debt condition. This observation aligns with the findings of</span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font5"> Ananda et al. (2022).</span></a><span class="font5"> Per the agency theory, the strategic focus of companies lies in meeting set targets. Firms opting for external financing inevitably incur obligations, including principal repayments coupled with the associated interest. Thus, a higher reliance on external funding results in a commensurate increase in the interest liabilities the company must shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fixed asset intensity positively correlates with financial distress, demonstrated by its computed value of 3.840, which exceeds the critical value of 1.977, and a significance value of 0.000, falling below the 0.05 threshold. Such results infer that as the value of fixed asset intensity escalates, the likelihood of financial distress</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The impact of a company's growth on financial distress is negative, leading to the rejection of the first hypothesis. Elevated company growth does not necessarily imply an augmentation in the firm's revenue or profits. This can be attributed to suboptimal management efficiency in relation to sales growth. Consequently, operational costs surge, increasing the potential for financial distress. The interest coverage ratio, on the other hand, does not influence financial distress. This suggests that merely the magnitude of interest expense neither characterizes the financial distress status of the company nor precipitates its onset. Fixed asset intensity exhibits a positive correlation with financial distress. The empirical results indicate that an increase in fixed asset intensity corresponds to a decreased likelihood of financial distress. When evaluated collectively, it's evident that company growth, interest coverage ratio, and fixed asset intensity jointly influence financial distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CEO overconfidence serves as a moderating variable, intensifying the effect of company growth on financial distress. However, it fails to moderate the relationship between the interest coverage ratio and financial distress. CEO overconfidence does moderate and amplify the influence of fixed asset intensity on financial distress. Further testing underscores that CEO overconfidence can act as a moderator for company growth, interest coverage ratio, and fixed asset intensity in relation to financial distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From this study, it's imperative for companies to strategically utilize funds from third-party sources. Injudicious utilization of external financing can precipitate adverse ramifications. Companies should optimize asset management to bolster profits, enabling the generation of internal funds for varied purposes. While CEO overconfidence can moderate aspects like company growth and fixed asset intensity, it's essential to ensure this overconfidence doesn't compromise financial decision-making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The research encounters limitations in the criteria adopted for company selection, as it doesn't encompass all manufacturing firms in Indonesia. There exists a disparity in the interest coverage ratio and fixed asset intensity when factored into the financial distress component. The measurement of CEO overconfidence is still reliant on dummy variables, and the study overlooks external variables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Future research endeavors could consider a broader sample scope and an extended research timeframe. Introducing novel or disparate variables might unveil additional determinants of financial distress that remained obscured in this study. Comparing the financial landscapes during and post the Covid-19 pandemic could offer invaluable insights. For companies grappling with financial challenges, prompt intervention is advised. This could entail judicious asset management, undertaking debt restructuring initiatives, curbing unnecessary expenditures, and maintaining vigilance towards external factors, including political dynamics.</span></p>
